Medium-bodied, the complexity continues on to the finish, continually expressing new sensations, ending with fresh cherry skins with a long, taught finish. Very few wines show this elegance and mineral tension, alongside with the dusty freshness and vibrancy. Columella has always had a special place in my heart, and this is a fine example.

46,The Sadie Family,Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie,"The 2017 Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie was produced with grapes from a vineyard in Villafranca del Bierzo, mostly Mencía with other varieties, as it's a very old vineyard.

47,The Sadie Family,Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie,"The second vintage of the Eben Sadie-Raúl Pérez joint venture, the 2014 Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie, was cropped from a vineyard in the village of Valtuille that was planted with mixed varieties, but mostly Mencía. It has marked rusticity and feels very earthy, a little spicy, with some oak undertones, hints of black olives and more concentrated and darker than the debut vintage. It has some wrinkly, slightly dusty tannins. This feels distinctly different from the wines of Raúl Pérez, more structured, in need of bottle aging and/or powerful food.

The palate is beautifully balanced and packed full of flavor: orange rind, bitter lemon, sea salt, lanolin and a touch of hazelnut, fanning out beautifully towards the finish that demonstrates superb vigor. This is a blistering follow-up to the 2014 and two minutes after the wine has departed, you can still feel the mouth tingling with salinity.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series T Voetpad,RP 97
49,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Treinspoor,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Treinspoor, Eben's Tinta Barocca cuvée, which he said has ""the biggest passport in South Africa"" since the grape has been grown there for a long time for fortified wine production, has a lucid ruby color. Eben told me that it is actually one of his most difficult sells but I am of the opinion that it is one of his best wines. Darker in colur than then other OVS labels, it has a captivating bouquet with raspberry, cranberry leaf, tobacco and damp wet clayey aromas. The palate has firm tannin that Eben compared to Piedmont, which I can understand. The acidity is beautifully judged with killer salinity and mineralité on the finish that both linger in the mouth. This is an outstanding South African wine.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Treinspoor,RP 97
50,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Kokerboom,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Kokerboom (the 2017 was being pressed at the same time as I was tasting it) has an intriguing bouquet with orange blossom, sea spray, lanolin and grilled walnut aromas, like others developing more intensity as it aerated in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with beautiful balance in the mouth, a perfect combination of sweet and sour, a tincture of almond macaroon lending sweetness towards the finish. This is the best Kokerboom that I have tasted.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Kokerboom,RP 95
51,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Soldaat,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Soldaat is one of the few labels from Eben that is still 100% whole bunch, aged in concrete only. It has a brambly red berry fruit, a slight granitic note overlayed by wilted rose petal. The palate is very fresh and vibrant on the entry, perhaps a little more body and density than previous vintages that I have tasted, with immense purity and varietal expression on the finish. This is excellent and a very strong follow-up to the 2014.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Soldaat,RP 95
52,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Pofadder,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Pofadder, the 100% Cinsault from Eben Sadie, come from slate soils that are not decomposed. It has a pure and mineral-driven bouquet, beautifully defined with red cherries and crisp strawberry fruit, a stoniness tucked just underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, tensile and linear, brimming with freshness and energy with raspberry and just a tinge of black cherry on the finish. Superb Cinsault, nuanced and detailed, an intellectual wine that will age with style.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Pofadder,RP 95
53,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skerpioen,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Skerpioen is the Chenin/Palomino cuvée. It is reticent on the nose and demands encouragement, with slight resinous scents with a touch of Jasmine. The palate is where the character lies with walnut, orange rind, potent salinity and an effervescent, vivacious spiciness towards the finish that is driven along by the acidity (the highest among Eben's OVS series in this vintage). This is excellent.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skerpioen,RP 95
54,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten, which comes from the heaviest soils, has an attractive bouquet with yellow flower and hazelnut aromas, just a hint of gingerbread that emerges with time. Perhaps this is the most mercurial aromatics of Eben's 2015s. The palate beautifully balanced once again, a crisp line of acidity, just a slight viscosity here with hints of clear honey and quince jelly on the long and tender finish. Very fine, but I think it has more to give.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,RP 95
55,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skurfberg,"The 2015 Old Vine Series Skurfberg, Eben Sadie's pure Chenin Blanc was picked late afternoon and driven to the winery through the night when it is cooler. It offers attractive aromas of lanolin, nutmeg, nectarine and peach skin, well defined and gaining intensity all the time with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, smoked walnut, bitter lemon and a pinch of white pepper, developing more and more intensity with time. This is sublime.",2015 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skurfberg,RP 95
56,The Sadie Family,Columella,"The 2014 Columella comes in a 13.65% alcohol, the lowest since 2000 according to Eben Sadie. ""I am not looking for a wine that necessarily goes BOOM when it's first shown...I want a wine to age. There is no new oak now used during the élevage. When we look chemically at this wine, it is much more age-worthy than what we were making in 2010: there is a lot more CO2, the tannins are around 30% less ripe, a combination of the picking date and the grape variety, which makes them more oxygen stable."" It has a brooding bouquet with brambly black fruit, briary, wild heather and cold stoney aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red and black fruit, very well balanced with crisp but firm tannins. The fruit feels blacker than previous vintages, a little more salinity towards the finish that conveys a subtle marine influence. It is a more introspective take on Columella, but this lends it an intellectual rather than hedonistic bent that I think was not a characteristic of the wine in its earlier vintages.",2014 Sadie Family Columella,RP 95
57,The Sadie Family,Palladius,"The 2014 Palladius, which was matured in 30% foudres that have been eschewed for subsequent vintages, has a refined bouquet with light petrol-like scents infusing the stone fruit aromas (peach skin and nectarine). The palate is medium-bodied with a slight viscous entry, the acidity very well pitched with a generous, caressing, lightly honeyed finish. Enjoy this over the next 4-5 years.",2014 Sadie Family Palladius,RP 95
58,The Sadie Family,Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie,"There is a wine from Bierzo born from the friendship between Raúl Pérez and Eben Sadie, called precisely 2013 Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie (between friends Pérez and Sadie). It is produced from a very north-facing old vineyard on clay soils where there are many different varieties mixed in the field, mostly Mencía but also with Alicante Bouschet and Estaladiña, the local strain of Trousseau, and even some white grapes. The whole clusters fermented in two open 500-liter oak barrels with some foot treading. The wine matured in Taransaud barrels for one year. It has a very light color (the Trousseau?) and a light and aromatic nose, floral, with something citric (orange peel); it's very open and showy. The palate is medium-bodied with ultra refined tannins and great acidity. It drinks nicely, it's fluid and fresh, very tasty and with great length. 700 bottles only. ",2013 Sadie Family Valtuille Entre Amigos Pérez y Sadie,RP 95
59,The Sadie Family,Verdelho,"The 2015 Verdelho has a captivating bouquet with nutmeg, white pepper and just a hint of fennel, but these scents are very subtle and only gradually unfurl. The palate is medium-bodied with yellow plum, apricot and a dash of white pepper. There is a gentle build here, with the spice element becoming more accentuated with time, and there is a tremendously long, slightly oxidative finish. Cerebral and sensual. ",2015 Sadie Family Verdelho,RP 95
60,The Sadie Family,Mencia,"The 2015 Mencia has a divine, very pure bouquet that is a little austere at first, keeping to itself, then unfurling with blackberry and raspberry aromas, cool and beautifully poised. The palate is medium bodied with bell pepper-tinged black fruit that lend it a Cabernet Franc, almost Chinon-like character. Linear towards the finish, this is a very fine Mencia with a lot of potential.",2015 Sadie Family Mencia,RP 95
61,The Sadie Family,Agiorgitiko,"The 2015 Agiorgitiko was tasted at Rosa Kruger's seminar and to the best of my knowledge, is an experimental bottling. It has a very complex bouquet with blackberry, boysenberry, incense and violets that blossom in the glass and is beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with brambly black fruit with mint, fennel and sea salt; it is linear and masculine, holding something back on the finish and gradually gaining intensity in the glass. This has good potential and I will be intrigued to taste further vintages.",2015 Sadie Family Agiorgitiko,RP 95
62,The Sadie Family,Assyrtiko,"The 2015 Assyrtiko, another grape variety currently being trialed and shown at the Rosa Kruger seminar at the Cape Show, has quite an intense bouquet with nutmeg, Provençal herbs, grilled walnut and smoke, with just a light oxidative touch that lends tension. The palate is well balanced with good weight in the mouth, hints of marmalade and white fennel coming through. This is a very exciting white from Eben Sadie, building in the mouth towards a taut, dry finish that will beg you to take another sip. ",2015 Sadie Family Assyrtiko,RP 95
63,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,"Mrs. Kirsten passed away on April 10, 2015, so lucky recipients of the 2014 Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten will notice a little homage to this lady on the neck label. It has an extremely complex, quite profound bouquet: melted wax mixed with damp soil, white tea, candied orange peel and dandelion. The palate is very pure and slightly waxy in texture, with touches of white pepper and rosemary sprinkled over the lightly honeyed fruit, dialing down the gears towards the finish that is so effortless. This is a cerebral wine -- 750 milliliters of delicious intellect. ",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,RP 95
64,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series T Voetpad,"The 2014 Old Vine Series T Voetpad comes from vines planted in 1887 and where Eben said works the most. A field blend of Semillon Blanc and Gris, Palomino, Chenin Blanc and Muscat, it has an extremely complex bouquet with white fennel, tarragon and rosemary infused tropical fruit with subtle resinous scents developing with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly honeyed texture, just a pinch of white pepper and fennel, and extremely well balanced with a harmonious, ineffably complex finish that lingers long and tenderly in the mouth. With the Mev Kristen, this is Eben's best Old Vine Series White in 2014. Stunning. ",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series T Voetpad,RP 95
65,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skurfberg,"From 90-year-old Chenin Blanc vines on sandstone soil, the 2014 Skurfberg is closed on the nose at first and then gradually unfurls with dried honey, honeysuckle, broom and hazelnut scents, just a touch of yeastiness underneath. It has wonderful delineation and complexity. The palate is extremely well balanced with enthralling poise and race, freshly sliced pear and red apple interlaced with five-spice towards the long finish. This is one of those wines that needs to be cellared for several years and will definitely repay you.  ",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skurfberg,RP 95
66,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Soldaat,"The 2014 Old Vine Series Soldaat...swear to God...if I was served this blind I would claim it to be a Burgundy Pinot Noir. It has a wonderful definition and transparency, and is extraordinarily pure with an enthralling sous-bois undertow. The palate is taut and linear, very focused, nimble and poised with fine but strict tannin; it is tightly wound with tertiary red berry fruit that segue into a poised finish. This is a serious Grenache from Eben Sadie, one that deserves to be cellared for as long as you can withstand. (Eben thinks it will go into a slumber after a couple of years, so bear that in mind.) ",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Soldaat,RP 95
67,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Treinspoor,"The 2014 Old Vine Series Treinspoor is 100% Tinta Barocca planted in 1974, a grape that Eben Sadie rates very highly. There is something placid about the nose, which is refined and reclining in a comfy chair at the moment. The fruit is slightly darker than the 2014 Pofadder, with a hint of vanilla and cola tincturing the dark berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, grainy tannin and supremely well-judged acidity. It becomes more structured and masculine towards the finish, which offers great details, precision and superb mineralité. Eben compared it to a cross between Nebbiolo and a Syrah, and I can see where he is coming from. One of those wines that shifts your preconception about a grape variety. ",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Treinspoor,RP 95
68,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Kokerboom,"A blend of Semillon Blanc and Semillon Gris planted in the early 1900s, the 2014 Old Vine Series Kokerboom has a very subtle bouquet, extremely nuanced with lanolin, beeswax, dried apricot and just a touch of brioche. The palate is very well balanced, slightly candied on the entry with dried orange peel and dried quince. There is a lovely texture here, just a mote of waxiness with a finish that is reposed and effortless. This is perhaps more approachable compared to the Skurfberg, but likewise it will repay cellaring.",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Kokerboom,RP 95
69,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skerpioen,"Planted half a mile from the sea and 60 meters above sea level, the 2014 Old Vine Series Skerpioen is a Chenin Blanc and Palomino blend that was showing a reduced nose that slightly rubs out the delineation. There's something quite feral about the bouquet: wet wool, a bit of sea-spray and damp earth. The palate is well balanced with a keen line of acidity (there is 6.8 grams per liter of acidity), touches of smoke walnut and lanolin coming through with a nicely poised, lemon rind and nutmeg finish with a saline aftertaste. I would give this a good shake before pouring to get rid of any possible reduction and then enjoy this wonderful wine.",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skerpioen,RP 95
70,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Pofadder,"From 48-year-old vine Cinsault grown on slate soils, the 2014 Old Vine Series Pofadder has an extremely pure bouquet, less tertiary than the 2014 Soldaat (grown on decomposed sandstone), with touches of pressed flowers infusing the fresh strawberry and redcurrant fruit. With aeration, there is an intriguing incense/potpourri note. The palate is taut and crisp, brimming over with tension and extremely focused with slightly more brittle tannins than the Soldaat -- lending the chalky-textured finish fine symmetry, albeit without quite the same sustain. It might sound odd, but it tastes fabulous.",2014 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Pofadder,RP 95
71,The Sadie Family,Columella,"The 2013 Columella is matured for ten months in cask with 10% new oak, and then another ten months in foudres; Eben believes this slows down the maturation. It has a very complex bouquet, mercurial on the nose, and bestowed with wild strawberry and cranberry scents, incense and a hint of marmalade that is beautifully detailed. The palate is medium-bodied, extremely refined and mineral-laden, symmetrical and standing on tip-toes on the finish -- something that this label could not do when Eben started. It is compact at the moment, but it will turn into an astonishing Swartland wine. ",2013 Sadie Family Columella,RP 95
72,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten has a lucid straw color. It has a very aromatic bouquet with smoked walnut, wax resin, cinnamon and just the right amount of oxidation. The palate is medium-bodied with a very poised entry, the acidity is nicely poised, and there a slightly viscous texture with a touch of welcome heat at the back of the throat; the wine is long, feral and bloody gorgeous on the finish. Cerebral and sensorially satisfying; it's wines like these that put not just Eben Sadie, but South Africa on the map. ",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,RP 95
73,The Sadie Family,Palladius,"The 2013 Palladius comes in at 13.7% alcohol, one of the lowest for this label. It has a refined bouquet of dried honey, fern, smoked walnut and damp earth all very well defined. The palate is very well balanced with wonderful poise, a strong marine influence with a dash of white pepper and nutmeg towards the long and sustained finish. Another superb Palladius. ",2013 Sadie Family Palladius,RP 95
74,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Pofadder,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Pofadder brings to mind estuarine scents of mudflats and seaweed on the nose – you can almost hear the yacht’s ringing chiming in the breeze. The palate is very harmonious with crisp red cherry fruit, fresh strawberry and a touch of white pepper over a lattice of fine tannins, charged with immense vivacity and energy on the finish. This is simply beautiful. ",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Pofadder,RP 95
75,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series T Voetpad,"The 2013 Old Vine Series T Voetpad is a blend of Semillon Blanc, Semillon Gris, Palomino, Chenin Blanc and Muscat d’Alexandrie. It has a beeswax and jasmine-scented bouquet that is very well defined, but will require bottle age to develop vigor. The palate is rounded and sensual on the entry, with Mirin, orange zest, mandarin, white pepper, rosemary and lavender notes. Long and persistent in the mouth, this is one of Eben's best Old Vine Series release this year. Profound.",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series T Voetpad,RP 95
76,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Kokerboom,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Kokerboom has a complex nose: honeysuckle, jasmine, fynbos, touches of lavender and fennel emerging with time. The palate is beautifully balanced with a crisp line of acidity, subtle notes of orange zest, mandarin, dried pineapple, Asia spices and cumin toward the finish that has a slight Indian influence. Stunning.",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Kokerboom,RP 95
77,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Treinspoor,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Treinspoor comes from Tinta Barocca planted in 1974. It has a deep lucid purple/cherry color. The nose is very harmonious with raspberry, redcurrant, wilted rose-petals scents and a touch of quince that gently unfolds but remains demure. The palate is very harmonious with slightly chewy tannins, nigh perfect acidity and wonderful definition and minerality toward the finish that has more backbone that I anticipated. Excellent.   ",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Treinspoor,RP 95
78,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skurfberg,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Skurfberg (100% Chenin Blanc) has a beautifully defined bouquet with scents of pressed yellow flowers and lanolin. The palate is very tense with deceiving weight in the mouth, almost distant at first but then those gorgeous honeycomb and citrus peel flavors crash upon the shore. Sublime.",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skurfberg,RP 95
79,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skerpioen,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Skerpioen, a Chenin Blanc and Palomino field blend, has a light, distant bouquet with scents of Mirabelle, lime cordial and a touch of dried quince. The palate is well balanced with a peppery touch on the entry, crisp acidity with notes of Mirin and white pepper towards the finish. Very fine. ",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Skerpioen,RP 95
80,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Soldaat,"The 2013 Old Vine Series Soldaat has a lucid cherry hue. The nose is earthy and dusty, green bell pepper aromas with damp clay. The palate is spicy on the entry with dry tannins. This is totally uncompromising with a terse, gritty, saline finish where I would have liked a little more flesh. There is always one member from Eben Sadie's Old Vine Series that does not ""play ball"" and this year it is the sulking Soldaat.",2013 Sadie Family Old Vine Series Soldaat,RP 95
81,The Sadie Family,Columella,"The 2012 Columella is a blend of 76% Syrah, 17% Mourvedre and 7% Grenache from the Swartland and Paardeberg area, hand-sorted and fermented in 2,000-liter open wooden fermenters and raised in barriques (10% new) for 12 months then one year in oval foudres. It has a very well-defined bouquet that repays time in the glass: wild strawberry and bilberry, cloves and white pepper, distant sea spray scents. The palate is medium-bodied with taut tannins, crisp acidity, superb backbone and real “authority” on the finish. One of those wines that will instantly change anyone who does not take South African wine seriously. ",2012 Sadie Family Columella,RP 95
82,The Sadie Family,Palladius,"The 2012 Palladius is the usual blend Chenin Blanc, Grenache Blanc, Clairette Blanche, Viognier, Verdelho, Roussanne, Semillon Gris, Semillon Blanc and Palomino. It has a lovely nose of white flower, melted butter, lanolin and honeysuckle all beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with smooth lightly honeyed fruit, pitch perfect acidity and a caressing but complex waxy finish. Killer South African white wine.",2012 Sadie Family Palladius,RP 95
83,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Kokerboom,"The 2012 Old Vine Series Kokerboom is a pure Semillon planted in the 1930s that takes the form of white and red-berried fruit. It offers an elegant bouquet with scents of dandelion, wilted white petals, broom and jasmine. The palate is well-balanced with a fresh vibrant entry, crisp acidity and poised, elegant finish with hints of apricot and quince lingering long in the mouth. Superb – this represents one of Eben’s best offerings from his Old Vine Series.

84,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series T Voetpad,"The 2012 Old Vine Series ‘T Voetpad is a field blend of grape varieties that were planted between 1900 and 1928. The nose is quite closed at first and demands patience, reluctantly revealing scents of wild heather, undergrowth and a touch of honeysuckle. The palate is well-balanced with yellow plum, orange zest and dried honey on the entry. It is very harmonious with superbly judged acidity that infuses so much tension that it errs toward a Riesling in style, as if the ‘T Voetpad cherry-picks the best from each grape variety. It is blessed with a wonderful, vivacious finish of white peach, Clementine and yellow plum on the long waxy-textured finish. This is another exceptional addition to the Old Vine Series.

It offers an understated bouquet that unfolds delicately in the glass, with hints of lemon curd, apricot blossom and lime cordial. The palate is well-balanced and offers more of a textural experience than overt flavors. It has a lovely waxy texture with a touch of lemongrass on the finish leaving the mouth tingling after the wine has departed. Excellent.

87,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Treinspoor,"The 2012 Old Vine Series Treispoor is made from a parcel of old bush vine Tinta Barocca planted in 1974. It has a very pure, voluminous, billowing bouquet with red currant, strawberry preserve and a whiff of smoke that is beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a soft, rounded opening: plenty of dusky ripe red berry fruit, briery, cloves and bay leaf to enjoy, though it just needs a little more tension on the finish. That is but a minor quibble – another superb addition to Sadie’s Old Vine Series.

90,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Mev Kirsten,"The 2012 Old Vine Series Mev. Kirsten comes from what are believed to be the oldest Chenin Blanc vines in South Africa planted between 1905 and 1920. Opening two bottles, I have difficulty in fathoming out the bouquet, the cooler sample showing less volatility but missing the vigor that I was anticipating. The palate is nicely balanced with a resinous texture. However, it is difficult to pin down the personality of the wine, bereft of flavors to really write about. This is just a perplexing addition to the series that despite my best efforts, I could not work out. This wine just seemed like an impossible Sudoku puzzle. Just 900 bottles produced.

91,The Sadie Family,Columella,"The 2011 Columella is more reticent on the nose when compared directly against the 2010: straight-laced and linear with subtle tertiary notes that unfurl with aeration. This seems more masculine than the previous vintage. The palate is vibrant and poised on the entry with fresh crisp tannins, effervescent citrus fresh red and black fruit, a dash of white and black pepper and a beautifully poised finish. Once those aromatics awaken with time, this will be a stunning Columella. Drink 2015-2025.  Eben Sadie simply wrote “old rules” in the spec sheet for his Old Vine Series, which sums up his approach perfectly. You never quite know what you will get with the wines – so please bear that in mind. That is what makes them so thrilling, because when they do excel they can represent something that attains true profundity, wines that are willing to offer intellectual as well as sensory pleasure. They are produced in small quantities so they can be difficult to track down, though in my opinion they remain very keenly priced?for now.

The nose is well-defined and as nonchalant as Eben Sadie himself, gently unravelling blackberry, charcoal, eau-de-vie and allspice scents that are perfectly controlled. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, slightly grainy tannins. It is extremely well-balanced with supremely well-judged acidity. I much prefer this toned-down style of late, allowing the grape varieties and terroir to be articulated without interruption. Gorgeous! Drink 2014-2022.  

Eben Sadie told me at the Cape Wine Show back in September 2012 that he was looking forward to focusing all his energies upon South Africa, now that he has relinquished his venture in Priorat. His wines continue to furrow their own individual path, distinctive in so many ways. At some future point I plan to write in more detail about Eben, so for now let’s get straight to what is another raft of exceptional wines.

94,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Kokerboom,"he 2011 Old Vine Series Kokerboom is a marriage of around 70% Semillon Blanc and 30% Semillon Gris from vineyard planted in the 1930s in the Olifants River Region. The red Semillon was apparently once common in South Africa but is now on the verge of extinction. It spends about 18 months resting on the lees before bottling without fining or filtration. The nose of initially taciturn, as if to say “Not in,” yet returning to my glass an hour later it has blossomed into an ethereal bouquet of yellow flowers, yellow thyme and a touch of lime: precise and beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with an intense, controlled entry with stem ginger, spices, dried honey and a little tangerine. It is wonderfully balanced, extremely complex and utterly compelling, yet you just know that in twenty years time, it will evolve into something extraordinary. Quite simply: as profound as any Grand Cru Burgundy you could buy. 

You gotta love the eminence gris, the “Gandalf” of Swartland winemakers, Eben Sadie. Curiously, when I sat down with him at the Cape Show it was the first time we had met. He assured me that his samples had been safely despatched for my attention – the only problem being that he had sent them to the wrong side of the Atlantic. C’est la vie. Eben told me that he is withdrawing from his venture in Priorat so that he can focus entirely upon South Africa and that can only be a good thing for the country’s wine industry. Eben is a man full of principles and ideals that he is unafraid to see carried out in his wines, which in my opinion are aligning closer to his vision of what they should be with every vintage. Now let us move on to Eben’s Old Vine Series of wines. Let me make it clear that these very limited bottlings are as much an intellectual exercise as a sensory one. If you are seeking wines that mean something – then you should learn about them first, understand where Eben is coming from and then appreciate them for what they represent as much as how they taste. So my scores are in some ways irrelevant here. I just urge readers to understand them, try one out, make up their own mind, drop me a line and tell me what you think. And because they are so individual and I have only tasted the once or twice, I have refrained from drinking windows, but suggest that for the most part while they can be enjoyed young, they are also well worth cellaring.

95,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skerpioen,"The 2011 Old Vine Series Skerpioen is a blend of Chenin Blanc and Paolmino planted on limestone soils in a particularly cool part of Swartland that receives a paltry 300mm of rainfall per year. The bouquet is a heaven-scent kaleidoscope of aromas: wild honey, beeswax, dried apricot, hazelnut and smoke that are brilliantly defined. The palate is perfectly balanced with subtle notes of strawberry, Clementine, grapefruit and passion fruit struck through with awe-inspiring tension and minerality. This is such a pretty wine – you will be smitten upon first sip.

96,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Soldaat,"The 2011 Old Vine Series Soldaat is a pure Grenache from Piekenierskloof planted at just over 700m on granite soils. It has a real, rustic, “old skool” Chateauneuf-du-Pape inspired nose reminiscent of an old Rayas. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp strawberry and redcurrant fruit. It is slightly lower in alcohol than the other OVS wines (13%) and yet there is wonderful volume and length to the Grenache. There is a touch of sour cherry and balsamic towards the finish that lingers long in the mouth. There is just so much character in this Grenache you will want to have another bottle after it is finished.

97,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series T Voetpad,"The 2011 Old Vine Series ‘T Voetpad (which means footpath in Dutch) is a field blend of Semillon Blanc, Semillon Gris, Palomino, Chenin Blanc and Muscat d’Alexandrie from a 1.4-hectare plot in the Piquetberg Mountains. The vines were planted between 1900 and 1928 on their own roots, which are dry farmed thanks to an underground river. The nose has a gentle perfume of lemon thyme, dried apricot and a hint of beeswax that is delicate and precise. The palate is pure and perfectly balanced with well-judged acidity. There is a touch of spice on the entry with dried orange peel and a little rosewater towards the finish that has a slight edginess to it. This is a beautiful, thoughtful wine.

98,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Skurfberg,"Also from the Olidants River Region comes the 2011 Old Vine Series Skurfberg. It is born from three parcels of pure, old bush vine Chenin Blanc planted on decomposed sandstone soils. It has a very delicate, precise bouquet of walnut, lemon rind, blackcurrant leaf and lanolin. The palate is beautifully balanced with tightly wound citric fruit and minerals. The finish is reticent at the moment, but both its intensity and persistency suggest it will reward years of bottle age.

99,The Sadie Family,Old Vine Series Treinspoor,"The 2011 Old Vine Series Treinspoor is pure Tinta Barocca from a parcel to the west of Malmesbury that was planted in 1974. It has a generous nose of mulberry, dates and a touch of cola on the wonderful defined bouquet that unfurls with each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fresh acidity, pixilated red fruits that dance on the tongue, with hints of cola and salted liquorice towards the bright, effervescent finish. This is simple delicious, although I might be less inclined to age this compared to other Old Vine Series wines.

Only the wineries of great winemakers are worth vandalizing. This is exactly what happened to Eben Sadie in Priorat recently. Jealous neighbours? Probably. Rather, they should have sat down with him and learnt how to make world-class wine. Eben is the outspoken, peripatetic, terroir-obsessed winemaker who has been instrumental in putting Swartland on the map. He produces a small portfolio of comparatively expensive, but highly coveted wines based on Rhone varieties sourced from his seemingly never-ending search for pockets of old bush vine and unique terroirs. These are cerebral wines built to age. My only criticism is that older vintages have been rather brawny and alcoholic, so I was pleased to hear courtesy of part-time vineyard manager, Brian MacRobert, that Eben is seeking to reduce alcohol in the future. Eben was actually in London when I visited and it was Brian who took me through the wines as well as barrel selections for the 2010 vintage. He also produces his own label “Tobias,” which was impressive, so keep an eye out for his name in the future.

It displays impressive persistence in the mouth and you find yourself contemplating this wine long after you have swallowed it, each sip slightly different to the last. Sublime. Drink now-2020.  

Only the wineries of great winemakers are worth vandalizing. This is exactly what happened to Eben Sadie in Priorat recently. Jealous neighbours? Probably. Rather, they should have sat down with him and learnt how to make world-class wine. Eben is the outspoken, peripatetic, terroir-obsessed winemaker who has been instrumental in putting Swartland on the map. He produces a small portfolio of comparatively expensive, but highly coveted wines based on Rhone varieties sourced from his seemingly never-ending search for pockets of old bush vine and unique terroirs. These are cerebral wines built to age. My only criticism is that older vintages have been rather brawny and alcoholic, so I was pleased to hear courtesy of part-time vineyard manager, Brian MacRobert, that Eben is seeking to reduce alcohol in the future. Eben was actually in London when I visited and it was Brian who took me through the wines as well as barrel selections for the 2010 vintage. He also produces his own label “Tobias,” which was impressive, so keep an eye out for his name in the future.

109,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Columella,"The 2008 Columella is a Shiraz based blend with a little Mourvedre grown on mainly granite soils and aged for two years in barrels. It has a very distinct bouquet with vibrant, well defined, wild dark berried fruit intermingling with subtle aromas of dark plum, blackberry leaf and a touch of cassis all with great precision. The palate is medium-bodied with fine but sturdy tannins, supremely well balanced with superb acidity and expression, finishing with great mineralite on the finish that has slight blur of alcohol. Drink 2013-2020.

110,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"Raveneau's 2010 Chablis 1er Cru Montmains is showing beautifully, bursting from the glass with an expressive bouquet of green apples, white flowers, ripe Meyer lemons and wet stones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied and precise but enveloping, with an elegantly textural attack, ripe but racy acids and a long, stony finish. As is often the case, this is among Raveneau's most open and accessible 2010s, and its youthful charm already makes it hard to resist.",2010 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 93
111,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"This bottle derived from a special cuvée of Raveneau's 1986 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux that the Domaine matured in new barrels. When they didn’t like the result, the wine was bottled separately and forgotten in a garage. Then, some 30 years later, the Raveneau family allowed a local restaurant to take their pick. This was the best bottle that I’ve encountered to date, and the wood influence—which can sometimes be quite prominent—was barely discernible. Indeed, in a blind tasting, it would have been hard to tell the wine apart from Raveneau’s regular 1986 Butteaux, which is why I deem this note worthy of publication. Offering up a honeyed bouquet of mandarin, saffron, fresh mushroom and iodine, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, with a lively spine of acidity, fine depth at the core and an immensely long, sapid finish. As longtime Chablis-lovers will know, Raveneau's 1986s are fabulous, as this Butteaux reminded me.",1986 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
112,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2017 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is brilliant, unwinding in the glass with a complex bouquet that mingles aromas of Meyer lemon and white peach with notes of oyster shell, iodine, wet stones, blanched almonds and wheat toast. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and searingly concentrated, with racy acids, chewy structuring extract and a long, precise and mouthwatering finish. Cropped at a mere 13 hectoliters per hectare, it nonetheless retains superb balance and a very promising sense of reserve.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
113,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"Raveneau's 2017 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is also immensely impressive, offering up aromas of citrus oil and preserved lemons, orange rind, yellow orchard fruit, almond paste and fresh pastry that are very subtly inflected by a light touch of oak spice. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and layered, with immense concentration, a broad-shouldered, textural profile and a long, powerful finish. In a blind tasting, this is the one wine in the portfolio that might almost pass for a grand cru from the Côte de Beaune; and in that sense, Chablis purists might be tempted to express a preference for the Valmur this year, but there is no denying that this is an extremely compelling Les Clos.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
114,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2017 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot is showing brilliantly, delivering a complex bouquet of honeysuckle, smoke, mandarin and wheat toast. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and satiny-textured, with striking concentration, lively acids and a pure, precise finish. From the domaine's oldest parcel—planted in 1936—this is a powerful, ineffably complete Blanchot that will be well worth following for three decades.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 93
115,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"A brilliant wine that numbers among the finest recent renditions of this cuvée, Raveneau's 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux wafts from the glass with a complex bouquet of lemon oil, green apple, dried white flowers, almond paste and iodine. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and layered, with terrific depth and concentration, racy acids and exquisite textural finesse. Impeccably balanced, this is a strikingly elegant, complete Butteaux that's somewhat reminiscent of the domaine's 2010, though I suspect it will drink well sooner than that wine.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
116,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"The 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Montmains has also realized all the potential I saw last year, unwinding in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of green apple, white flowers, wheat toast and smoke. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, tensile and tight-knit, with fine concentration, racy acids and a long, incisive finish. This is well worth seeking out and is an especially good candidate for cellaring.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 93
117,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre is also performing well, despite what was a challenging vintage for the Raveneau family's holdings in this, their emblematic premier cru. Offering up aromas of ripe Meyer lemon, green apples, white flowers and almond paste, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with a broader, more powerful profile than the Butteaux but with less cut and not quite the same length on the finish.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
118,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"Confirming its promise from barrel, the 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons bursts from the glass with notes of fresh peach, citrus blossom, green orchard fruit, beeswax and almond paste. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with a broad, textural attack, lively acids and excellent concentration. While it's one of the more expressive wines in the range it will reward some bottle age.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
119,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Forêt is showing very well, bursting with scents of orange rind, green apple, white peach and spring flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with an elegantly textural attack, a pretty core of fruit and a long, precise finish. This is quite reminiscent of the 2010 rendition chez Raveneau, and it is well worth seeking out.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 93
120,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"Aromas of crisp white peach and green apples mingling with notes of oyster shell, white flowers and almond paste introduce Raveneau's 2017 Chablis Villages, a medium to full-bodied, ample and elegantly satiny wine with a lively spine of acidity, good depth and dimension, and a long, stony and very delicately wood-inflected finish. This is the finest rendition of this cuvée to date, and while it will reward some bottle age, it should offer a broad drinking window.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Villages,RP 93
121,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Petit Chablis,"The 2017 Petit Chablis reveals pretty aromas of white flowers, citrus zest, fresh peach and crisp green apple, followed by a medium to full-bodied, lively palate that's pure, precise and delicately textural. Bottled only in magnum, these vines—which are located on the plateau above the grand cru slope—were only planted in 2010, but they're already delivering terrific results.",2017 Domaine Raveneau Petit Chablis,RP 93
122,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2014 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre confirms its status as one of Raveneau's best renditions of this site over the last two decades, unfurling in the glass with a textbook bouquet of lemon oil, crisp green orchard fruit, oyster shell and anise, framed by light reduction that dissipates in the glass. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegantly glossy and seamlessly layered, with excellent concentration and tension at the core, concluding with a long, precise and penetrating finish. This wine is evolving at a glacial pace and is still far from reach its peak, but its quality is impossible to miss.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
123,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Served alongside the 2014 vintage, the 2012 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre is also showing very well indeed, offering up a riper bouquet of fresh peach, green apple, beeswax and oyster liquor that's also framed by a light touch of reduction and reveals a very delicate touch of recently used oak influence. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and satiny, with more amplitude and flesh, with a deep, concentrated core. While it's balanced by racy acids, this is broader shouldered a more powerful than the 2014 but can't match the latter's tension and precision. Jean-Marie Raveneau observed that spring frosts and July hail reduced the crop by some 40% and that the berries were small and concentrated, comparing the wines to the domaine's superb 1986 vintage.",2012 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
124,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"A complex bouquet of sweet citrus oil, white flowers, oatmeal, mandarin, pastry cream and beeswax, framed by light reduction, introduces the 2010 Chablis Grand Cru Clos, a full-bodied, satiny-textured wine with a broad, ample attack and a deep, layered mid-palate that's powerful and muscular in profile, concluding with a long, expansive finish. This is a benchmark Les Clos from Raveneau, and to my palate it also ranks as the finest rendition of this vineyard produced this year.",2010 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
125,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Notes of oatmeal, waxy citrus rind, crisp yellow apples and white flowers introduce the 2010 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre, a medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional wine that has begun to acquire some supplemental texture with bottle age while remaining lively and precise, concluding with an elegantly chalky finish. The 2010 isn't as powerful as the brooding 2012 served alongside, nor is it as tensile and incisive as the 2014, but it is on a similar qualitative level and numbers among the vintage's high points.",2010 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
126,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2008 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is the purists' choice, unfurling in the glass with a classy bouquet of tangerine, lemon oil, oyster liquor and beeswax. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, elegantly glossy and incisive, built around a bright line of acidity that still imparts more tension and energy than is to be found in the 2010 vintage tasted alongside, but it has plenty of concentration and flesh on its structural bones, too. This is a powerful but precise rendition of Les Clos that is still only entering adolescence.",2008 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
127,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2005 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is riper and more sun-kissed in profile than the 2008 and 2002 vintages that bracketed it, offering up a rich bouquet of apples, iodine and pastry cream that's framed by notes of smoky reduction. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with a textural attack, good depth and concentration, but without the lively, incisive acids and precise fruit tones that define the classic years. This is a powerful, brawny Les Clos but purists will want to gravitate toward the racier vintages.",2005 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
128,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2002 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is showing brilliantly and numbers among the high points of this tasting. Unfurling in the glass with a bouquet of ripe lemons, oyster shell, dried white flowers, beeswax and pastry cream, it's full-bodied, envelopingly satiny and layered, with superb depth at the core, succulent acids and a long, saline finish, distinguished above all by an ineffable sense of completeness. This is a spectacular Clos that has just arrived at early maturity.",2002 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
129,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 1998 Chablis Grand Cru Clos was mildly corked, so I'll refrain from offering a score. But the wine revealed a mature, honeyed bouquet with notes of mandarin and lanolin, followed by a full-bodied, deep and dense palate with plenty of tension and cut. A pristine bottle would be outstanding.",1998 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
130,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 1992 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is drinking superbly well, wafting from the glass with an initially exotic bouquet of mandarin, passionflower, beeswax and citrus blossom that's marked by a touch of botrytis but becomes more classical with aeration, segueing into scents of ripe citrus oil and botanicals reminiscent of a mature Sancerre from Edmond Vatan or François Cotat. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and elegantly textural, with a broad attack, excellent concentration and depth at the open but vibrant core, concluding with a long, precise finish. This should maintain its plateau for another decade or more, but it is hard to resist today.",1992 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
131,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"This bottle of the 1990 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre derives from a special cuvée that was never released by the Raveneau family, so I've refrained from giving a score but included this note for interest. In times gone by, Chablis was vinified and sold in new half-barrels (called ""feuilletes"") to be bottled by the purchaser: winemaking was more oxidative (""air is the wine's friend,"" François Raveneau used to say), with two rackings and 18 months of élevage. To celebrate the birth of his son, Jean-Marie Raveneau attempted something similar in 1990, keeping two new (full-sized) barrels of Montée de Tonnerre separate from the main cuvée and racking them twice before bottling. Offering up aromas of burnished apple, beeswax, tangerine oil, iodine, subtle spices and nougat, the wine has integrated its new oak quite well, though it's higher-toned than the regular cuvée. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied and ample but precise, with tangy acids and a pure, mineral finish. This is certainly a fascinating Chablis!",1990 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
132,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is the most reserved wine in the cellar, slowly unfurling with notes of lemon oil, spring flowers and wet stones, without ever revealing the full expression of fruit that will come with some time in bottle. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and powerful, with the most concentration, texture and extract of any wine in the cellar, structured around a succulent but soft line of acidity, the finish lent lift by subtle but mouthwatering grip. This will age on its concentration more than its acids, but it should develop very well in bottle.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
133,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is a rich, exotic rendition of this great bottling, exhibiting aromas of honeyed peach, crisp apricot and sweet spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, powerful and layered, with a deep and ample mid-palate, concluding with a long, saline finish. It's a textural, gourmand Valmur that I suspect may resemble the 2001 vintage when it reaches maturity.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
134,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot wasn't frosted, and it's one of the highlights of the range chez Raveneau this year, wafting from the glass with a lovely bouquet of white flowers, Meyer lemon, honeycomb and crisp pear. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, with a deep core, juicy acids and a long, beautifully delineated finish. It's a superb Blanchot that will develop gracefully for two decades or more.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 93
135,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"Raveneau's 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux is excellent, offering up a youthfully reserved bouquet of apple, white peach, beeswax and dried flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, with lovely texture, considerable mid-palate amplitude and a bright line of acidity, concluding with a firm, salty finish that balances its somewhat gourmand attack. Along with the Vaillons, the Butteaux stood out as one of the most complete of Raveneau's premiers crus this year, revealing more and more nuance over several days. Right now, it's quite closed, but I won't be surprised if it becomes quite musky and exotic after a few years in the cellar.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
136,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons is showing particularly well from bottle, exhibiting aromas of lemon oil, white flowers, green apples and a light framing of reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, glossy and textural, with excellent concentration, chewy structure and a long, intense finish. It's one 2016 that can go head to head with its 2017 counterpart.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
137,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Montmains exhibits notes of mandarin oil, crisp apple and honeycomb, followed by a glossy, full-bodied and expansive palate, with ripe acids, good concentration and chewy extract. It's a more textural, generous expression of the vintage that will offer a lot of pleasure at the table.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 93
138,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"From one of the parcels that suffered the most in this challenging vintage, the 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre offers up notes of citrus zest, pear, lemongrass and anise. On the palate, it's full-bodied, rounded and very glossy, with good concentration and stony depth but an atypically gourmand, textural profile. It's a lovely wine, but it isn't one of the great classics from this superb vineyard.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
139,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"The 2016 Chablis Villages wasn't too heavily impacted by the year's frosts, and it's quite classic in profile, offering up aromas of lemon oil, grapefruit pith, white flowers and crisp apples. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly glossy and bright, with a fleshy core underpinned by bright acids and a tangy, mouthwatering finish.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Villages,RP 93
140,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"From a parcel of younger vines, the 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Forêt offers up attractive aromas of lemon, green apple, oystershell and spring flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, glossy and pure, with racy acids, attractive purity and a delicately chalky finish. It's one of the most elegantly open-knit wines in the Raveneau cellar.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 93
141,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Petit Chablis,"A discreet but pretty nose of peach and citrus introduces the 2016 Petit Chablis, a medium-bodied, gourmand wine with glossy texture and a generous core of fruit. These young vines suffered in the frost, yielding a mere 15 hectoliters per hectare that attained 13% natural alcohol—not a common occurrence in this appellation, needless to say. Enjoy it in its vibrant youth.",2016 Domaine Raveneau Petit Chablis,RP 93
142,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"The 2014 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux is a brilliant young wine, offering up a classy bouquet of minty green apple, salty oystershells, lemon oil, wet stones and subtle white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample but controlled, with a stunning alliance of elegantly glossy texture and tangy acidity. Structurally, the wine is quite tight-knit and firm at the core, with exceptional depth, though such is its balance and harmony that it's deceptively drinkable today. The true fireworks, however, will be reserved for those with the patience to cellar this Chablis for another 6 or 7 years. A strong case could be made that the 2014 is the finest Raveneau Butteaux in a decade.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
143,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"The 2014 Chablis Villages from Domaine Raveneau is excellent, offering up a classy bouquet of lemon oil, green apple, beeswax and subtle almond paste. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and bright, with good depth at the core and a tangy, saline finish. Like many 2014s, this is beginning to shut down, and while it's still delicious, I'd be inclined to forget remaining bottles for 3 or 4 years.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Villages,RP 93
144,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2011 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is excellent, unfurling in the decanter and glass with notes of confit lemon, citrus zest, fresh pastry and a light framing of reduction. On the palate, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and substantial, with this cuvée's characteristic marriage of texture, concentration and focus, concluding with a long finish. Along with the Clos, Valmur is always Raveneau's most backward wine, but in the precocious 2011 vintage it can already be approached with pleasure. Those seeking to catch it at its peak, however, should wait another 4 or 5 years and follow it for a further 10.",2011 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
145,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"Raveneau's 2011 Chablis 1er Cru Forêt is drinking very well, offering up an expressive nose of preserved lemon, white flowers, beeswax and even creamy white peach. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied and elegantly glossy, with good depth and concentration, underpinned by racy acids. While some of the more tight-knit 2011s in the Raveneau cellar still need a few more years—most notably the Montée de Tonnerre—readers who own this lovely Forêt, which surpassed my expectations, should feel no qualms about starting to pull corks.",2011 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 93
146,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2009 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is a brilliant wine that's still a mere adolescent as it approaches its tenth birthday, unfurling in the glass with notes of waxy lemon rind, lime zest, wheat toast and iodine, framed by light reduction. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, with immense density and controlled power, displaying a deep, tight-knit core and concluding with a long, mineral and beautifully defined finish. This is a fabulous rendition of Raveneau Valmur with its terroir front and center despite the warmth of the vintage.",2009 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
147,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"At age ten, the 2007 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot is still an adolescent, and a few more years of cellaring are recommended, but its quality is readily apparent. The wine unfurls in the glass with notes of lemon oil, fresh pastry, honeycomb, oystershell and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and textural, with chewy old-vine extract, succulent acids and a deep, youthfully vibrant core. This represents an enticingly gourmand expression of 2007 Chablis and ranks as one of the vintage's highlights. I'd start pulling corks in earnest from 2020.",2007 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 93
148,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Raveneau's 2005 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre is beginning to drink beautifully as it approaches age 13, wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of lemon oil, mandarin, drawn butter, iodine, beeswax and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and textural, with the mid-palate richness and generosity of a warm vintage but with a delineated, chalky finish that's faithful to the Montée de Tonnerre. This is a gourmand, fleshy vintage for Raveneau—though not to the extent of 2006 or 2003—but the wines are aging gracefully.",2005 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
149,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2003 Chablis Grand Cru Clos is still full of life, wafting from the glass with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, crème brûlée, confit lemon and warm oatmeal. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and textural, with a lavishly glossy attack and a deep, concentrated core that's amply endowed with chewy extract, concluding with a strikingly long finish. Given its gourmand, sun-kissed profile, this is certainly an atypical Les Clos, yet the slow pace of its evolution and its incredible intensity belie any facile generalizations about warm vintages. I suspect that as it matures, the terroir will become more and more prominent. Anyone wishing to speculate as to what a great 1947 Chablis might have tasted like in its youth should contemplate a bottle of Raveneau's 2003 Clos.",2003 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
150,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Raveneau's 2009 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre was gorgeous in its youth, and while the wine is still drinking very well, it has begun to lose a bit of energy, so I would be inclined to start pulling corks on remaining bottles. Aromas of ripe lemon, spring flowers and Asian pear precede a medium-full, richly textural wine with chewy phenolic grip on the finish but a somewhat low-acid profile that reflects the warm growing season and harvest.",2009 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
151,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"Raveneau’s 2008 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux opens in the glass with delicate notes of apple, white peach, spring blossom and pastry cream, its aromatic profile making me wonder if it was this cuvée’s turn to season the Domaine’s new oak barrels this year. On the palate, the wine is medium-full, with good cut and moderate concentration, simultaneously a touch reserved and quite structurally open-knit.",2008 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
152,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"Cool and precise, the 2004 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is a youthful classic, offering up pretty much everything one could want in a 13-year-old Valmur. Opening in the decanter with a nose of green apple, iodine, oyster shell and a touch of smoky reduction, on the palate the wine is full-bodied, three-dimensional and rock solid at the core, with excellent concentration and cut and a long, penetrating finish.",2004 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
153,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"Raveneau’s 2001 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot is marked by a bit of botrytis influence this year, which lends this normally rather generous site a decidedly gourmand quality. The wine bursts from the glass with an exotic bouquet of preserved lemon, honey, tangerine oil and peach, the prelude to a textural, full-bodied and concentrated palate impression that retains unerring precision despite its somewhat atypically precocious format. This is at its peak, and now is a very good time to start pulling corks.",2001 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 93
154,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru les Butteaux escaped any damage by hail and is, in Isabelle’s opinion, the most classical and Chablis-like, whereas other wines express the growing season. It has a pretty, perfumed, perhaps exotic bouquet compared to the other cuvées this year and is very expressive, with apricot blossom emerging with time. The palate is very well balanced with a precise line of acidity and, again, is very expressive with a shimmering, quite captivating finish that exudes both mineralité and fruit intensity. This has turned into an outstanding Butteaux that punches above my prediction from barrel.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 93
155,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru les Clos has a very tight bouquet with a subtle marine/estuarine influence, gradually opening to reveal walnut and hazelnut notes. Coming back after five minutes, there is a light minty note. The palate is powerful and very well balanced, a fine line of acidity struck through the lightly-spiced fruit with hints of nutmeg and even fennel that lead to a poised but very persistent and satisfying finish. This is just an extremely satisfying Les Clos that will give 20 to 30 years drinking pleasure.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 93
156,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2015 Chablis 1Er Cru Vaillons was difficult to pin down last year from barrel when it trailed behind the other premier crus. Of course, it was just playing a trick on this writer because it has blossomed into one fabulous Vaillons. It is blessed with a pretty, wet limestone-scented bouquet, very open and transparent with a touch of spice developing with aeration. The palate skips along, fresh and tensile with a keen thread of acidity. I love the tension here that enlivens this Chablis from start to finish and lends the finish real energy and persistence. What a great Vaillons this is turning out to be and a bit of a revelation after its showing from barrel.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
157,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Montee de Tonnerre has a tightly wound bouquet with a slight fumé note at first, then a trace of sea cave and a tang of the sea. The palate is very well balanced with a fine line of acidity. This has wonderful harmony, a dash of nutmeg and spice that emerges toward the finish and a very persistent aftertaste that will not go away (not that you want it to). This is an outstanding Montée de Tonnerre destined to give a lot of Chablis-lovers a lot of pleasure.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
158,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur has a very backward nose, one of the most laconic of Raveneau’s 2015s at the moment. The palate is powerful and intense with a citric entry, quite tensile in the mouth and regaining its composure to deliver a very harmonious orange zest and white peach-tinged second half that feels very assured. This Valmur is packed with potential. Superb.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 93
159,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Montmain, which was touched by hail, offers a sense of depth and power on the nose. This is clearly more backward than its peers but very well defined. The palate is rounded and slightly honeyed on the entry with a fine thread of acidity. It builds in the mouth but there is something broody about this Montmains which makes it beguiling. Give this two or three years at least because instinct tells me it will repay those with the nous to cellar this Chablis away.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 93
160,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Forets has a tightly wound bouquet, perhaps a little resinous compared to other premier crus, with a touch of nutmeg developing with aeration. The palate is very well balanced with a citric twist on the entry—touches of orange zest and clementine leading to a pretty, poised and quite elegant finish. What a beauty this Forêts is becoming.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 92
161,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot actually has a difficult time following the Butteaux and as I opined when I tasted them from barrel, it feels a bit mean and reticent at the moment. Perhaps it is holding something back for later. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, linear and taut in style but I want this to give me something more on the finish. Let’s see how this evolves because at the moment there are a couple of storming premier crus that show more promise.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 92
162,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"The 2015 Chablis Villages enjoyed a normal yield and possesses an expressive orange blossom and apricot-tinged bouquet that is just very pure and pretty. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, a touch of spice and is very harmonious, with a slight nuttiness conveyed by the persistent finish. This is an excellent introduction to the delights of Domaine Raveneau.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Villages,RP 92
163,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Petit Chablis,"The 2015 Petit Chablis is the second vintage from vines planted in 2010 that Isabelle Raveneau told me are sensitive to frost. It has a pretty bouquet with touches of peach and rosewater, more like a village cru. The palate has a dash of ginger on the entry and very good weight for a Petit Chablis with a rounded, slightly fiery finish. This has improved since I tasted it from barrel. I have given it a couple more points.",2015 Domaine Raveneau Petit Chablis,RP 92
164,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"Purloined by Isabelle Raveneau to share over dinner, the 1995 Chablis 1er Cru les Butteaux showed beautifully after 22 years. The bouquet is intense with lime, dried honey, lanolin and a slight touch of wet wool, as if borrowed from a mature Chenin Blanc. It has superb delineation, though maybe you could argue it lacks a little subtlety. The palate is very well balanced, quite viscous on the entry with great depth. Lime and grapefruit at first, then more tropical tones of guava and pawpaw with a thick, waxy-textured finish. I appreciate the presence and volume of this Butteaux, and pristine bottles should keep another decade. Tasted June 2017.",1995 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 92
165,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,"The 2000 Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot, probably not one of Raveneau's most famous premier crus, had a fully mature bouquet of damp moss, tilled earth and citrus fruit, perhaps not as detailed as other mature Raveneaus that I have encountered. The palate is ripe on the entry with dried pineapple and peach notes, moderate acidity but just a little monotone on the finish. Drink now as it will not improve further. Tasted November 2016.",2000 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,RP 92
166,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 1995 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchots performed brilliantly after more than two decades in bottle. It had an elegant grapefruit and clear honey-tinged bouquet that is beautifully defined and seemed to blossom in the glass, gaining more and more intensity with each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied and very refined, the quality of the terroir clear to see. Very harmonious and focused, it fans out gloriously on the finish, completing a fabulous mature Blanchots that is à point. Tasted November 2016.",1995 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 92
167,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Brouilland. The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre has a fragrant bouquet with citrus lemon, yellow flowers and orange blossom scents, a fine threat of mineralité underneath. The palate is well balanced with a rounded, peachy entry. There seems to be a bit if new oak here but it is nicely integrated and imparts attractive praline notes towards the finish. This simply needs more time. Tasted May 2016.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 92
168,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru les Clos has a much more expressive bouquet than the 2015, with beautiful orange blossom and smoky scents decorating the nose. The palate is very well balanced and so saline in the mouth that you almost want to reach for your bucket and spade. This Les Clos is so seductive and so harmonious, seeming to bloom and deliver fabulous intensity on the finish. Whereas Valmur is the pick in 2015, the Les Clos might be the pick in 2014, thanks to its sense of completeness. But as I mentioned in my remarks from barrel last year, patience will be paramount for those seeking to witness this Chablis at its peak.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 92
169,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchots is a contender for Domaine Raveneau's finest release in this great year for Chablis. It has an extremely well defined, marine-influenced bouquet that delivers captivating intensity. This is a Chablis that looks you straight between the eyes. The palate displays exquisite balance with razor-sharp acidity. It feels so lively and vivacious, with a wonderful sense of harmony and poise towards the finish. This is sophisticated and classy, but it will need 4-6 years to really settle into its groove. You cannot bestow too many superlatives here.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 92
170,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur, which I did not taste last year from barrel, has a riveting bouquet with cold, wet limestone and slate-like aromas that are extremely focused. The palate is well defined with a keen thread of acidity, very saline with a mouthwatering sappiness on the finish. Stubbornly backward, almost sultry and petulant, it will need several years to really settle into its groove. I strongly suspect this has something up its sleeve for those who allow this to mature for several years in the cellar.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 92
171,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2014 Chablis 1Er Cru Vaillons has a gorgeous bouquet, far superior to the 2015, bridled with scents of  apricot blossom, guava and wet limestone that are all beautifully defined. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, very saline in the mouth with a long and persistent finish. You can sense the animation in the mouth. This is a fabulous Chablis Vaillons that shimmers with glee.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 92
172,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"The 2014 Chablis 1er Cru Montmain has a lifted bouquet with granite and slate-like aromas, a little withdrawn at the moment, but you can tell this will repay 3-4 years in bottle. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, hints of orange rind and lemon zest, good depth in the mouth with fresh pear and quince towards the finish. Impressive, but it will need time. This killer Chablis has a bright future ahead of it.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 92
173,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,"The 2014 Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot has a strict, delineated, wet limestone-scented bouquet that gains intensity with aeration. The palate is fresh on the entry, quite saline in the mouth à la Montée de Tonnerre, with fine delineation and a Les Preuses-like spiciness that lingers on the finish. Excellent, but it deserves 3-4 years in bottle.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,RP 92
174,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The 2014 Chablis 1er Cru Forets has a wonderful, granitic bouquet; it is reserved but beautifully defined and very intense. The palate is medium-bodied with touches of orange cordial and a twist of lime. It has a bracing line of acidity and it gently fans out with a slight waxiness towards the finish, which as I suggested from barrel, perhaps just lacks that knockout blow that its fellow Premier Crus deliver. Still, it represents a fine Raveneau.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 92
175,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Petit Chablis,"The maiden 2014 Petit Chablis has a crisp, sea spray scented bouquet that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is well balanced with a sappy, mouth-watering opening. It might need a little more acidity, but it is lively and has adequate charm. Readers should note that the domaine elected to bottle this in magnum only.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Petit Chablis,RP 92
176,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"I ordered a bottle of the 2010 Chablis 1er Cru les Butteaux at the impeccable Au Fil du Zinc restaurant in Chablis and immediately grabbed my pen to scribble a tasting note. This is such a scintillating Chablis, one that encapsulates everything great about the 2010 vintage. The nose is mineral through and through--imagine getting down on your hands and knees and just inhaling limestone after a shower. The palate continues that tensile, mineral-driven theme. It is incredibly tense, perhaps benefiting from a slight, but pleasant reduction towards the finish, with awesome length and precision. What a fantastic Butteaux from Domaine Raveneau.",2010 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 92
177,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"This wine was tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur from Domaine Raveneau has a very candied bouquet with hints of Seville orange marmalade and white fennel, adding intrigue to the mineral-rich, citric fruit. The palate is beautifully balanced with a generous opening - plenty of bright citric fruit with veins of walnut lending it an almost Meursault-like personality. There is good length, and a sense of confidence and ambition about this Chablis Grand Cru that may warrant an even higher score down the line.",2012 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 92
178,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2006 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre from Domaine Raveneau is maturing very nicely. The nose is strict and correct at first, gradually opening up and offering tantalizing glimpses of fennel and even a faint scent of lobster bisque. The palate is precise and linear on the entry, and then fans out with careless abandon, slightly honeyed towards the finish that perhaps shaves away some of the tension it would have otherwise possessed. But it remains a wonderful Chablis that has ten or 20 years ahead.",2006 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 92
179,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2014 Chablis Valmur Grand Cru has a not dissimilar nose to the Blanchots at the moment with limestone, citrus lemon and flint aromas are beautifully defined and focused. Every swirl of the glass and it seems to become more and more intense. The palate is fresh and tensile, just a hint of sour lemon on the entry, very good depth, but perhaps not quite achieving Blanchots' penetration and sophistication on the finish at the moment.",2014 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 92
180,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2013 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur has an extremely well defined bouquet with what feels like more precision than the Blanchots. Here, there is a touch of generosity with almond and even a very slight creme brûlée scent. The palate is very well balanced, more vivacious and charming than the curmudgeonly Blanchots with a sensual, caressing and lightly spiced finish that is just very...Valmur. This is superb.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 92
181,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux has a sensual nose with subtle hazelnut, smoke and almost resinous scents, verging on Riesling scents, that are beautifully defined. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with pleasing, mouth-watering salinity, easing back toward the finish with Granny Smith apples and a healthy dash of lemongrass. I can imagine this changing a lot in bottle – it comes across as a mercurial Chablis Butteaux.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Butteaux,RP 92
182,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2013 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos has a very precise and commanding bouquet with intense citrus fruit and mineralité - hints of orange blossom and a daring touch of licorice developing with aeration. The palate is fresh and vibrant, quite steely on the entrance but fanning out wonderfully toward the citric finish. Perhaps like last year, it is the Valmur that really shines at the moment and might be Raveneau's wine of the vintage.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Clos,RP 92
183,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2013 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchots is much more reserved on the nose, biding its time, not wishing to make a grand entrance like some of the more expressive premier crus at this stage. The palate is fresh and crisp, again with impressive salinity and hints of ginger lending spiciness on the back palate. It does not quite deliver grand cru weight and penetration on the finish, mainly due to the vintage, but it does linger incredibly long afterward.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,RP 92
184,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons does not quite deliver the same intensity as the Montmains at the moment, although it is still well defined with more of a sea spray influence coming through. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry, just a suggestion of dried honey on the front palate, before it gently fans out on a walnut/smoky finish that is cut from the same cloth as the Montmains '13, albeit with an extra pinch of spice. This is excellent.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 92
185,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Montmain has a detailed bouquet with cold flint and even blackberry-leaf scents that are beautifully defined. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a keen acidic thread, driving citric notes with a slight walnut tinge on the tensile, orange rind finish. This lingers long in the mouth and should age better than the Fôrets '13.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montmains,RP 92
186,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Fôrets has a very attractive, pine needle-tinged bouquet with a subtle mineral element (wet limestone) in the background. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, clearly a level up from the village cru, with hints of shaved ginger flourishing toward the finish. This is showing nicely. There is something nonchalant about this Fôrets, although it needs perhaps just another year in bottle.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,RP 92
187,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"The 2013 Chablis Villages has commendable precision on the nose, almost Puligny-like in style. The palate is clean and fresh with light acidity, certainly one of Raveneau's more approachable Chablis wines, with an easygoing and slightly saline finish.",2013 Domaine Raveneau Chablis Villages,RP 92
188,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Chablis Chapelot 1er Cru from Raveneau has a rather austere bouquet, nicely defined with subtle mineral tones, but it needs more vigor and chutzpah. The palate is well balanced with grilled walnut on the entry, touches of bitter lemon and a pleasing, quite edgy finish. This did not show quite as well as it could on the day.",2011 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,RP 92
189,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Chablis Montée de Tonnerre 1er Cru is very austere and reticent on the nose at first, much like their Chapelot, but it opens nicely with subtle marine influences combining with the tertiary, hay bale scents. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, touches of lemon and almond, a subtle use of oak just rounding out the finish but this is very harmonious and refined, a real crowd-pleaser.",2011 Domaine Raveneau Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 92
190,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"The 2012 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos has a lovely nose that takes a few minutes to open, revealing subtle notes of hazelnut, grilled almond and strong saline notes. The palate is beautifully balanced with citrus peel, dried apricot, a hint of lemongrass and a long praline-tinged finish that goes on and on and on. Stunning. Drink 2015-2028+  

Though I have walked past many times and tasted their wines on many a pleasurable occasion, this was actually my first, and I hope not last, visit to the most iconic of Chablis producers. “Raveneau set the standards of excellence few aspire to,” wrote Rosemary George in her indispensable (and over-looked guide) to Chablis. Few would disagree with that sentiment, though I would never say that Raveneau is beyond reproach. Les freres Raveneau, Bernard and Jean-Marie presently run the estate and it was the former that opened the door in the Rue de Chichee, accompanied by his daughter Isabelle. Before commencing with the tasting that encompassed both 2013 and 2012, I asked Bernard about the differences between the two vintages. “The 2013 has been in barrel for around 6 or 7 weeks,” he told me. “We started the harvest on October 2, while the 2012 began on September 22. The 2013s are quite rich with slightly lower acidity than usual. The Right Slope wines are more tendu (taut) and interesting. We were a bit worried about the 2013s with regard to the quality of the grapes and the lack of acidity. They are not typical of Chablis, but they are very open and exotic. You find more minerality as you go up through the range, and vine age had an impact. There was 30mm of rain on Saturday, October 5 and it was so strong that the ripe berries fell off of the vine. The 2012 is completely different. It is more ‘Chablis’: perfect and very healthy grapes, small in terms of yield, around half the normal harvest. This was due to the spring frost, bad weather during flowering, a bit of hail and a lot of wind. Just before putting up the wires together we had a storm and a lot of the canes were damaged. There was a humid July with a lot of rain and so we decided to leaf pluck. Then there was a heatwave in August when the temperature was so high that some of the berries were burned. But in September, there were perfect conditions. There was slightly higher acidity in 2012 than 2013 but more homogeneity.” I then asked Bernard if there was a vintage he might compare 2012 to, and after consideration he suggested a mixture of the 1994 and 2001.

N.B. Kermit Lynch informed me that they have not set the prices of either 2012 or 2013 at time of writing.

191,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The 2012 Chablis Grand Cru Les Blanchots appeared stubbornly laconic on the nose at this stage, although the palate is very powerful and delivers assertive notes of fresh lime, Cornice pear and red apples, seguing into a captivating saline note toward the finish that lingers in the mouth. This broody, but compelling Chablis grand cru will need several years in bottle. Drink 2017-2027+

192,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2012 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons has a strict walnut and granite-scented nose with just a hint of tobacco (not often found in white wines.) The palate is extremely well-balanced and spicier than the 2013. The longer this remains in the mouth, the more vibrant and excitable it becomes, finishing in some style with shimmering lemongrass and lime zest. Excellent. Drink 2015-2026.

The palate is much more reserved than the aromatics suggest, but it is built around a killer line of acidity that lends tautness and electricity on the finish.

This was due to the spring frost, bad weather during flowering, a bit of hail and a lot of wind. Just before putting up the wires together we had a storm and a lot of the canes were damaged. There was a humid July with a lot of rain and so we decided to leaf pluck. Then there was a heatwave in August when the temperature was so high that some of the berries were burned. But in September, there were perfect conditions. There was slightly higher acidity in 2012 than 2013 but more homogeneity.” I then asked Bernard if there was a vintage he might compare 2012 to, and after consideration he suggested a mixture of the 1994 and 2001.

194,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The 2012 Chablis 1er Cru Forets has a very Chablis-like nose that is less exotic than the 2013, stricter and more mineral driven, slightly fume. The palate is precise with a suggestion of almond on the entry. It is very well-balanced with perfect acidity, leading to a gentle finish of almond and walnut that lingers in the mouth. This has fine potential. Drink 2015-2025.  

Though I have walked past many times and tasted their wines on many a pleasurable occasion, this was actually my first, and I hope not last, visit to the most iconic of Chablis producers. “Raveneau set the standards of excellence few aspire to,” wrote Rosemary George in her indispensable (and over-looked guide) to Chablis. Few would disagree with that sentiment, though I would never say that Raveneau is beyond reproach. Les freres Raveneau, Bernard and Jean-Marie presently run the estate and it was the former that opened the door in the Rue de Chichee, accompanied by his daughter Isabelle. Before commencing with the tasting that encompassed both 2013 and 2012, I asked Bernard about the differences between the two vintages. “The 2013 has been in barrel for around 6 or 7 weeks,” he told me. “We started the harvest on October 2, while the 2012 began on September 22. The 2013s are quite rich with slightly lower acidity than usual. The Right Slope wines are more tendu (taut) and interesting. We were a bit worried about the 2013s with regard to the quality of the grapes and the lack of acidity. They are not typical of Chablis, but they are very open and exotic.

195,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Bernard opened a 2001 Chablis 1er Cru Montee de Tonnerre because it was a botrytized year like the 2013. It has a strong petrol character on the nose and I agree with Isabelle Raveneau that there is an Alsace Riesling-inspired personality here. The palate is well-balanced and fresh with wonderful acidity, slightly viscous with a Saar-like intensity on the finish and a hint of wild mushroom on the aftertaste. God invented Chardonnay for wines like this. It is drinking perfectly now. Drink now-2018.

196,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The Raveneaus’ 2011 Chablis Vaillons offers an infectiously juicy, invigoratingly bright, and exhilaratingly buoyant performance centered on grapefruit and Meyer lemon, with suffusion of chalk and salt as well as pungent and piquant impingements of citrus rind and green herbs heightening the stimulating effect of its sustained finish. As it opens in the glass this reveals a subtle and alluringly floral dimension. Look for mid-palate textural richness as well as yet more-nuanced complexity to emerge over the next 8-10 years, though in fairness to the other Raveneau 2011 crus it must be pointed out that this wine from 20-year-old vines may simply be further along in its evolution – despite having been recently bottled – than its immediate stable mates. 

There is something disconcerting about stepping from their old cellar into the vaulted, spare stone and concrete expanse that now houses most of Bernard and Isabelle Raveneau’s barrels, but I have no doubt that the spaciousness of this new arrangement will have its subtle, positive influence on quality at what many would peg as the foremost estate in Chablis. And while I try to refrain from mentioning coopers by name (and in all but rare instances – with French tonneliers, anyway – succeed), I would simply point out that a comparison of the older and more recent barrels at this estate encourages me in the belief that changes taking place in that department, too, will only enhance quality. Bernard Raveneau describes 2012 as affording “lovely acidity and equilibrium,” and I do not doubt that its fruits at this address will uphold a reputation for improving in bottle and avoiding the premature oxidation that confounds wine lovers’ hopes for even some renowned and youthfully impressive Chablis. (Since it applies to all of my reviews of Raveneau’s 2012s, I suggest consulting my explanation in the introduction to this report of just how I utilize “+?” in rating wines before bottling.)

197,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"The Raveneaus’ 2011 Chablis Blanchots mingles bittersweet floral perfume, salt- and iodine-tinged crustacean shell reduction, and piquant huckleberry in a bright, juicy matrix of grapefruit and lemon. Subtly oily in texture yet buoyant, this finishes with glowing intensity and outright refreshment. Plan to follow it through at least 2022.  Isabelle Raveneau suggests that, especially in this vintage, the grand crus display not just the dividend in richness that would generally be expected, but also an advantage in energy, quality of acids, and ultimately age-worthiness. Lucky those who will be in a position to test that hypothesis over the coming decade!

This conveys delicacy and lift as well as persistent refreshment, one of hearteningly numerous examples (if – at least in U.S. retail terms – by far the most expensive) of the degree to which the right combination of site, vines and grower can transcend the modest expectations misleadingly conveyed by the terms “generic,” “simple,” or “village-level” as applied to a Chablis.

But what a site-driven divergence there is from that starting point! Here we experience the finesse of alluring aromatic adjuncts – lemongrass, iris, gentian and wintergreen – as well as mouthwatering suggestions of shrimp shell reduction and oyster liqueur; and the finish is both strikingly buoyant for its vintage and downright reverberative in an interactive manor especially familiar from this estate’s Les Clos.

The Montmains is all about textural elegance and finesse. Today the aromatics haven’t fully formed, but I expect that will happen over time. This is another attractive wine with plenty of the early appeal that is the hallmark of the vintage. I expect the Montmains will drink well pretty much upon release. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.

My visit with Bernard Raveneau was one of the highlights of my trip to Chablis earlier this summer. At their best, Raveneau’s wines are contemplative and breathtakingly beautiful. I never miss a chance to drink them whenever I can. The 2011 harvest started on September 5th and lasted 6 days. Hail was an issue in some spots, most notable Les Clos and Montee de Tonnerre, where yields were down 25%. Raveneau adds that a measure of minerality is missing because of the late rains in the season. Raveneau thinks the 2010s have more character than the 2011s. The irregular flowering was most severe on the right bank (Clos and Montee de Tonnerre in particular), while the left bank, which was a week later to flower moved through the flowering with only a 10-15% reduction in yields, modest within the context of the vintage. Raveneau told me the 2010s were very austere at the outset. He thought they might stay that way, instead the wines softened considerably after the malos, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The 2010s were bottled end of May 2012, quite late by Chablis standards. As for the wines, they are pretty stratospheric. There is a sense of utter life and vividness in the 2010s that makes them utterly irresistible.

Dark, pungent aromas and flavors lead to a generous core of fruit. Some rough edges remain, especially on the finish, but this is, nevertheless, a strong effort. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

Bernard Raveneau provides unusual perspective with regards to the 2010s. While most of his colleagues talk about a vintage with high acidity, Raveneau points out that the 2010s are actually low in acidity relative to the wines Chablis produced in the 1970s and 1980s. Yields in 2010 were 20% lower than in 2009. The vineyards on the right bank were affected by the irregular flowering, while the vineyards on the left bank were hit by hail in July. August was warm until the end of the month, when rain became a bit of an issue. Raveneau began harvesting the 2010s on September 22, while the 2009s were brought in beginning on September 14.

212,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"Tasted after the corresponding Blanchots, Raveneau’s 2008 Chablis Valmur brings one back stunningly to an uncanny sense of lift and refinement as well as introducing piquant nut oil and sweetly savory as well as saline intimations of scallop. The texture here is creamy yet luscious, refreshing citrus accompany its sense of buoyancy. Wafting hedge flower, rosemary, and rowan perfume, citrus oils, iodine, kelp, and purple plum distillate are among the elusive elements in this subtly complex display that lingers with extraordinary length. “Refined length and delicacy along with density, that’s typical Valmur,” says Raveneau in apt summation. I expect this beauty will prove worth lingering over for hours, or for 12-15 years. The 2007, incidentally, performed fabulously this spring. 

Bernard Raveneau had been among those growers most bursting with enthusiasm about his 2008s when I had visited the following April, likening them to 1996s but with effusively floral and high-toned herbal aromatics such as he said he had never experienced in his young wines. As with the 2007s (and compared with 2009s that Raveneau expected to give shorter elevage), the collection here was bottled largely in late spring and early summer, only two wines having been bottled when I tasted them this April. (The others were in tank or pre-assembled for me.) But it was already clear by then that this collection has justified its author’s initial excitement and confidence.

Uncannily combining a sense of textural richness, underlying extract, and decisively stony, alkaline, chalky, oyster shell minerality that go beyond its fellow premier crus in this collection. Yet this preserves a vintage-typical core of primary juiciness that helps convey lip-smacking appeal. Musky, sweet floral notes cling to the prodigiously long, expansive, finish of this almost certainly relatively un-evolved wine. Give it several years in bottle and expect to be rewarded for over a decade.

214,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Chapelot,"Iris, ginseng, and fresh lime on the nose of Raveneau’s 2008 Chablis Chapelot set the tone for a metaphorically cool, refined palate performance. Subtly creamy, yet refreshingly juicy and saliva-inducing; discreetly but endlessly fascinating, this remarkably buoyant, wafting wine strikes me as unusually ineffable – and besides, I just want to drink it! To be sure the family of mineral flavors here is maritime: salt, alkali, iodine, oyster shell ? but that doesn’t seem to quite capture the mystery. On the one hand this is the epitome of transparency and water color-like frankness. But with the other hand I just keep scratching my head trying to come up with words! Raveneau considers this an archetypical performance for its cru and his small plot of 60 year old vines, which he says this year suffered extremely from coulure. I would plan to follow this for at least a decade, but if you are lucky to latch on to a few bottles, don’t forget to marvel at one of them in its youth.

215,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot,"Scents of gunpowder green tea, crushed stone, ocean spray, and grapefruit rind rise from the glass of Raveneau 2008 Chablis Blanchots, which then displays a breadth and richness that one would not have anticipated from the nose. Floral perfume and alkaline, iodine, and maritime mineral notes continue on an almost custardy-rich, seamless palate and into a finish of estimable length, although the overall impression here is relatively restrained, despite the wine’s amplitude and textural richness. Certainly the sense of minerality goes all the way through. I suspect this will need more time in bottle than most of its siblings to really blossom and would anticipate being rewarded for a dozen or more years.

217,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Forêt,"The Raveneau 2008 Chablis La Foret – like his village wine, from young vines – displays a vintage-typical aromatic medley of iris, grapefruit, sage, green tea, white currant, and crushed stone. (Here, the exuberant 6 month old wine’s nose reminded me of Sancerre.) Firm in feel, palpably extract-rich and persistently bright, this cuvee’s fresh citrus, herbs, and lingering stoniness provided a rather 2007-like sense of cool restraint that contrasts with the sheer forwardness of its aromas.

An oily feel and spiciness reinforced by a hint of oak complement its bittersweet citrus oil flavors, and the texture here is quite plush for the vintage. But there is also a refreshing core of primary lemon and grapefruit juiciness, and this finishes with an impressive sense of energy and penetration.

219,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Villages,"The second annual Raveneau village wine, his 2008 Chablis combines vivid, irresistibly mouth-watering aromas of pink grapefruit, blood orange, quince, jasmine, and nut oils in a manner that put me in mind already last year of a great youthful Vouvray. (This was not the only Raveneau 2008 to have at age 6 months reminded me – or him – of wine from a different region and grape.) Succulent and rich; polished in mouth-feel; yet with a vivacious exuberance to match its outgoing aromas, this finishes with cleansing refreshment and an uncanny length and sense of lift. To say that it transcends its appellation does not remotely do justice to this wine from young vines of Raveneau’s own selection massale growing near Montmains. Raveneau comments that while he harvested these vines in the first half of October along with his premier crus, it appears as though the inherent risk is going to be a wine of too much richness! Who knows how this will age, though intuition suggests very well for at least 4-6 years.

220,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"Raveneau’s 2007 Chablis Les Clos is less severe, intractably dense, or obdurately stony than most of the vintage’s representations of this great site, being at once electrically energized and practically ethereal in its high-toned expressions of bitter-sweet floral and pit fruit distillates, citrus zest, white truffle, quarry dust, and ocean breezes. Luscious grapefruit and white peach seem to be mingled with a sea water reduction on the palate, leading to a finish that tugs relentlessly at the salivary glands and practically seems to suck blood from your gums, all the while displaying buoyancy that defies gravity. This is magical. If lucky enough to acquire multiple bottles, I would plan to stretch out the experience of them over at least a dozen years.

Bernard Raveneau views his bright, mineral-inflected 2007s – picked from September 10-16 – as potentially richer versions of 2004, since the former, he indicates, have gained in textural allure during their elevage. That also explains why he did not plan to bottle most of these 2007s until late spring or summer, and I have accordingly not tasted them since bottling. (Incidentally, Raveneau is very excited and intrigued by his 2008s, wines with an effusion of floral and herbal youthful aromatics that he says he has never before encountered, but whose finished results he speculated might combine aspects of 2006 and 2007.)

With terrific pungency and cut on the palate yet, at the same time, superb textural refinement, this combines refreshment, invigorating piquancy, and vivid chalkiness with subtle creaminess of texture and an effortless sense of finishing buoyancy that perfectly fits its persistently wafting floral perfume.

222,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Toasted nuts and lemon oil in the nose of the Raveneau 2007 Chablis Montee de Tonnerre (whose quantities were drastically reduced by hail) put one in mind of the Cote d’Or. But from that point on, it turns in a direction not possible anywhere other than Chablis. Honey, citrus oil, and fresh ginger reinforce an impression of bitter-sweetness on the palate, along with suggestions of musk, crustacean reduction, and brine. This finishes with electric vivacity and implacable grip, the sharp concentration of ginger, iodine, lemon zest, and white pepper creating a memorable sense of vibrancy.

Brine, iodine, and things crustacean and bivalvular mark the palate here, too, along with refreshing lemon, bittersweet floral perfume, and hints of tart red berry.

Satisfying richness of white peach and a glossy, silken texture help ameliorate any tendency of the wine’s pronounced pungency to become too aggressive, and a wonderful sense of scallop-like sweet, saline, animal savor emerges on airing, contributing – along with an enhanced impression of liquid floral perfume – to a finish of lasting fascination and memorable distinctiveness. This is by no means a typical 2007, let alone a Chablis distinguished by rectitude. I would plan on monitoring it closely and relishing it relatively early.

From tank, it offers a prime example of the sort of blazing brightness of citrus and almost visceral energy as well as the palpable underlying density and extract that inherently characterize its vintage. The mineral dimension here is equal parts adamant stoniness and savory, invigorating salinity, which makes for a shimmering exchange with fresh citrus in a zesty, ginger-spiced, lip-smacking, practically electrically-charged finish. To the possible extent that any of this wine’s intense concentration might reveal itself to have been influenced by botrytis, its evolution bears careful watching, but for now it seems as pure as it is bright and likely destined for at least 6-8 years of fascinating enjoyment.

Smelling bitter-sweetly of citrus oil along with hints of lanolin from its brief stay in cask, this comes onto the palate full of ripe peach, pineapple, and citrus and strikingly delicate and energizing, yet alluringly creamy in texture. With less grip or sense of finishing mineral character than the best of its fellow 2007 generics – a circumstance one is tempted to attribute to young vines – it is nonetheless a real charmer, with plenty of zesty and herbal subtlety and a buoyant, refreshing finish.

228,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis Grand Cru Clos,"Raveneau’s 2006 Chablis Les Clos offers a mysterious profusion of floral, nobly fungal, and mineral aromas. Gripping phenolics and tactile mineral intensity – chalk, tangerine and grapefruit zest, white pepper – are imbedded in a lusciously rich yet fresh white peach and citrus matrix so vivid I almost expected to find pulp in the bottom of my glass. In its elegant, shimmering interplay of mineral and fruit dimensions and scintillating, bitter-sweet floral perfume, and nut oils – all allied to tactile grip – this reminds me also of a great Riesling or Gruner Veltliner from the Wachau’s Achleiten. But the specific manifestations of fruit, flowers, and minerals here could only be realized in Chablis. The empty glass is mesmerizing, almost magic.

Bernard Raveneau is an unabashed partisan of his 2005s – and no wonder, based on the subset of those that I tasted, including a magnificent Valmur which he rightly terms “complete” and “close to his ideal.” Raveneau is less effusive in praise of his 2006s – each of which I tasted from a selection of barrels – opining that lavish fruit and richness are precisely this collection’s fortes.

(The Valmur, too, originates with a high average age of vine.) Diverse flowers and herbal high tones in the nose usher in a remarkably polished, refined palate, one no less tactile in its mineral dimensions than the Blanchots, but more transparent, and with a lift that matches its wafting floral perfume and a purity of yellow plum and grapefruit that are seductively succulent. This unforgettably persistent, truly grand cru should dazzle for 12-15 years.

I think he underestimates the depth of his own 2006s, and only hope I have opportunity to revisit some of them in five or ten years.

231,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The Raveneau 2006 Chablis Vaillons combines the best of both worlds: the irresistibly generous cherry and peach fruitiness of the Montmains with the thought-provoking mineral side of the Montmains. A truly intricate interplay of flavors entertains you: iodine, chalk, toasted pistachio, and cherry pit are all suggested in the dynamic, gripping finish of this easily ten-year wine.

This dynamic cru should be worth following for 7-9 years at least.

Lush, rich fruit follows on the palate, but with chalk, iodine, and wood smoke adding counterpoint and pulling one’s attention toward the particularly strong mineral dimension that is inherent in this site. Finishing with real grip, this promises a decade’s worth of fascinating evolution.

(Raveneau doesn’t believe in a lot of lees-contact, so that is not whence this creaminess comes.) Ravishingly pure, lip-smackingly luscious finishing fruit and subtle nut oils prove irresistible even if it this is one Chablis – in terms of descriptors anyway – that’s not about “minerals” and will probably be best enjoyed over the next 3-5 years.

This decadent, fruit-driven Les Clos also sports a long, candied apple-packed finish. Anticipated maturity: now-2013. Incidentally, Bernard Raveneau told me, “2005 is like 2002 in Chablis, a great vintage, yet some of the wines are even better. The main difference is that 2002 was homogenous across the entire estate and 2005 is not.”

257,Domaine Francois Raveneau,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The Chablis Montee De Tonnerre has smoke, steel and rock aromas as well as a beautifully complex, expressive, ample, muscular, and broad flavor profile filled with stones, lemon zests and toast. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2008.

The rating, with the range of scores in parentheses, indicates the wine was tasted from cask, not bottle.

Bernard Raveneau feels that the 1996s he and his brother Jean-Marie crafted will require ten years of cellaring before being approachable because of their tightly wound, high acid structures. His father, Francois Raveneau, has reportedly compared them to his '69s. I have not tasted any 1969 Domaine Raveneau bottlings so I cannot comment on the comparison, but found his remark interesting because most other vignerons I met in Chablis and the Cote d'Or were unable to recall a similar vintage (the only exception to this being Dauvissat's father who reportedly compared the 1996 vintage to 1949).

This estate's cellars, like those of Rene & Vincent Dauvissat, resemble the cellars of the Cote d'Or. Why? Instead of the massive foudres and stainless steel cuves found in other Chablis cellars, the Raveneaus and Dauvissats use oak barrels to ferment and age their wines.

The Raveneaus lived up to their reputation with the 1996 vintage, crafting stunningly complex, beautifully ripe, highly delineated, crystalline and exceedingly long wines.

In a nutshell, this wine illustrates why so many serious wine enthusiasts will pay staggeringly high prices for white burgundies without the fear of them falling apart after 6-12 months, a la new world Chardonnay.  This 1979 Chablis le Clos is a stupendous example of not only how well certain white burgundies age, but also improve in the bottle.  An intense fragrance of minerals, buttery pineapple fruit, and fresh apples is followed by explosive richness.  Yet the wine tastes fresh, vivacious, and crisp, and the finish must last for well over a minute.  This is an extraordinary example of what Chablis can be, but so rarely is.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and succulent, with powdery tannins, good depth of fruit and a fragrant finish.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,RP 93
293,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Derived entirely from lieu-dit Les Nosroyes, located below the premier cru Les Perrières, Ramonet's 2017 Puligny-Montrachet Village reveal notes of citrus oil, pastry cream, toasted almonds and white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and incisive, with racy acids and a chalky finish.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Puligny-Montrachet Village,RP 93
294,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean (Rouge),"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean (Rouge) offers up a deeper-pitched bouquet, featuring wild plums, raspberries, rose hips, licorice and orange zest.

295,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet Village,"Ramonet's 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet Village has opened up a little since I tasted it earlier this year, offering up notes of pastry cream, crisp green orchard fruit, citrus oil, vanilla pod and white flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and nicely concentrated, with sappy acids and a fleshy core. This is a charming but nicely defined Chassagne that will offer a broad drinking window.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet Village,RP 93
296,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,"This climat is typically one of the more incisive wines in the Ramonet range, but the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers is in fact unusually rich. Offering up notes of citrus oil, ripe peaches, honeycomb and almond paste, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and textural, with lively acids but considerable flesh on its structural bones.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,RP 93
297,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge),"Offering up aromas of peonies, plums, red berries and blood orange, the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge) is medium-bodied, pure and supple, with an uncommonly delicate profile for this site. It will drink well in the near and medium term.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge),RP 93
298,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles,"The 2017 Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles has turned out well, wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, wheat toast and orange oil. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with racy acids and a saline finish.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles,RP 93
299,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"One of the riper, richer wines in the range this year is the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot, a wine that exhibits aromas of ripe pears, acacia honey, white flowers and toasted nuts. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, thick and muscular, with ripe acids and a fleshy core of fruit. This is a rich Morgeot that's certainly marked by the sunshine of the vintage, more so even than the 2015 rendition.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 93
300,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge),"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge) bursts from the glass with an expressive bouquet of raspberries, cherries and orange rind. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, ample and succulent, with melting tannins and a fragrant core of fruit.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge),RP 93
301,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"The finest rendition of this cuvée since 2014, the 2017 Bourgogne Chardonnay offers up a pretty bouquet of ripe lemon, crisp green apple, white flowers and beeswax. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, satiny and succulent with ripe balancing acids and an expressive core of fruit. While this is a potentially age-worthy wine, note that a portion of this cuvée is bottled under Nomacorc and is best consumed in the near term.",2017 Domaine Ramonet Bourgogne Chardonnay,RP 93
302,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Montrachet Grand Cru is stunning, unfurling in the glass with youthfully reticent but already complex aromas of crisp green pear, mandarin, dried white flowers, honeycomb, toasted nuts and iodine. In the mouth, the wine is full-bodied, deep and powerful, with striking amplitude and volume, immense concentration and chewy structuring extract, its satiny attack segueing into a tense, focused mid-palate and finish. This is an austere, old-fashioned rendition of Ramonet's Montrachet that it is shaping up to be one of the three or four greatest white Burgundies of the vintage.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
303,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Ramonet's 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is also among the white wines of the vintage, nipping at the heels of their monumental Montrachet. Opening in the glass with a classy bouquet of lemon oil, white flowers, crushed rocks, mint and beeswax, it's full-bodied, powerful and very incisive, with a satiny attack, a deep and layered mid-palate and a long, searingly intense finish. Concentrated and tensile, it's the quintessential Chevalier-Montrachet.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
304,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is lovely, offering up aromas of sweet yellow orchard fruit, iodine, lemon oil, hazelnut cream and honeycomb. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and richly textured, with considerable flesh for the vintage and a deep, concentrated core, though balanced by tangy, incisive acids. The finish is long and expansive. It's a terrific Bâtard that will develop beautifully in the cellar.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
305,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes is superb, wafting from the glass with aromas of Anjou pear, iodine, tangerine oil and wet stones, subtly framed by a delicate touch of new wood. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with excellent concentration, incisive acids and a long, precise finish. This is more old-fashioned than the 2014 rendition, and if that wine resembles the domaine's 2010, this has more affinities with the 2008.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 93
306,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets is superb, unfurling in the glass with notes of lime zest, lemon oil, Anjou pear, orange blossom, wheat toast and crushed chalk. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and reserved at the core, second only to the Ruchottes this year in terms of depth and concentration, with a tangy line of acidity and a long, precise finish.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,RP 93
307,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Ramonet family lost fully 90% of their crop to frost in this grand cru, but the 2016 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has turned out very well, offering up lovely aromas of green orchard fruit, Meyer lemon, fresh mint, pastry cream and iodine. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and satiny, with broad shoulders and a textural attack but considerable cut and tension. In its tangy, incisive profile it harks back to the white Burgundies of yesteryear, and I suspect it will prove very long lived.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
308,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,"This cuvée is typically the most fragrant and open-knit of Ramonet's premiers crus, and the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte is no exception. Wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus blossom, Meyer lemon and green orchard fruit, it's medium-bodied, pure and satiny, with a broad, elegant profile that eschews any success. It's a particular success this year.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,RP 93
309,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers des Dents de Chien,"The 2016 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers des Dents de Chien unfurls in the glass with aromas of pears, dried flowers and pastry cream, framed by a touch of light reduction that always seems to mark this cuvée chez Ramonet. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, tangy and pure, with a vibrant core of fruit, bright structuring acids and a long, pure finish.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers des Dents de Chien,RP 93
310,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret Monopole,"From a vineyard that was formerly owned by Vincent Girardin and that Jean-Claude Ramonet has in fermage, the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret Monopole displays an old-fashioned bouquet of musky peach, tangerine and honeycomb. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and ample, with a rich, layered mid-palate that's structured around vibrant acids. The extremes of the vintage make their mark but it's a superb wine in it somewhat idiosyncratic style.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret Monopole,RP 93
311,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean (Rouge),"The finest red in the cellar is the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean (Rouge), a medium-bodied, fleshy wine with good concentration, juicy acids and supple tannin that bursts with smoky plum and cherry fruit.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean (Rouge),RP 93
312,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot reveals aromas of green orchard fruit, iodine and mandarin, followed by a medium-bodied, succulent palate that's juicy and succulent, with an attractively balanced palate that doesn't attain the levels of concentration and depth that are to be found in the 2015 or 2014 renditions, though it remains an excellent achievement in a challenging vintage.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 93
313,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte exhibits pretty aromas of red berries, dried flowers, orange rind and herbs. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, tangy and a little rustic, with less flesh on its structural bones than the Clos Saint-Jean this year.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,RP 93
314,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge),"Aromas of spicy cassis, cherries and dried flowers introduce the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge), a medium-bodied wine with a crunchy core of fruit and a light framing of youthfully chewy tannins.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Rouge),RP 93
315,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge),"Aromas of strawberry, cinnamon and currant leaf introduce the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge), medium-bodied, succulent wine with fine but firm tannins.",2016 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot (Rouge),RP 93
316,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot is beginning to drink very well, offering up a classy bouquet of green pear, iodine, honeycomb and a subtle framing of smoky oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, with racy acids, excellent concentration and a long, nicely delineated finish. It's aging very well and still hasn't reached its peak.",2012 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 93
317,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"The 2008 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes from the Domaine Ramonet is exceptional, opening in the glass with a lovely bouquet of crisp green orchard fruit, drawn butter, apricot pit and almond cream. On the palate, the wine is glossy and full-bodied, its elegant textural creaminess underwritten by a bright—even racy—line of acidity, its finish long and penetrating. It's hard to say whether 2008 or 2010 is the more successful vintage chez Ramonet, but based on several bottles of this superb 2008 that I enjoyed in March, I'm beginning to incline toward the former.",2008 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 93
318,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,"The 2007 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte is drinking beautifully, wafting from the glass with a fragrant bouquet of dried flowers, Griotte cherry, strawberry and earthy bass notes. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied and silky, with a sappy core of fruit, melting tannins and juicy acids. This lovely red Chassagne boasts all the merits of the vintage with none of its disadvantages.",2007 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,RP 93
319,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"With white Burgundies from this era, one's mileage may vary, but this bottle of Ramonet's 1999 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet was utterly pristine, opening in the glass with a beautifully vibrant bouquet of popcorn, buttered apples and white flowers. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, elegantly glossy and intensely concentrated, with a deep, energetic mid-palate and a long, precise finish. While this Bienvenues boasts almost chewy levels of extract, the racy acids of the 1999 vintage preclude any hint of ponderousness.",1999 Domaine Ramonet Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
320,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Drunk from magnum, the 1985 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is an extraordinary wine, unfurling in the glass with a multifaceted bouquet of toasted nuts, iodine, ripe but crisp yellow orchard fruit, pastry cream and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, immensely layered and penetrating, with stunning minerally structure, searing concentration and an immensely long finish. Structured more like a red wine than a white, this is a brilliant wine from one of Domaine Ramonet's greatest vintages of the decade, and it has a long future ahead of it.",1985 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
321,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte is lovely, wafting from the glass with a fragrant bouquet of wild berry fruit, potpourri, spice and plums that exemplifies why this vintage can be so attractive in the Côte de Beaune. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and full of energy, with a succulent core of fruit, velvety tannins and long sapid finish, displaying impressive depth and volume. In fact, this is as good a young Clos de la Boudriotte from Ramonet as I can remember tasting.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,RP 93
322,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Jean-Claude Ramonet's 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru is exquisite, wafting from the glass with a youthful bouquet of lime, lemon pith, toasted nuts, pastry cream and fresh mint. On the palate, the wine combines the amplitude and texture of the Bâtard with the incisiveness and energy of the Chevalier, its glossy, multidimensional attack followed by a deep, limpid mid-palate and a long, penetrating finish.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
323,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is a magical wine, offering up a youthfully reserved bouquet of lemon oil, preserved citrus, white flowers, subtle oak vanillin, wheat toast and a smoky top note. On the palate, the wine is searingly intense, with superb concentration, lovely depth and dimension and incredible energy in this ripe white Burgundy vintage. Unsurprisingly, this is the most tensile, vertical wine in the Ramonet cellars this year and will benefit accordingly from bottle age.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
324,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is superb, opening in the glass with a beautiful bouquet of yellow orchard fruit, tarte tatin, toasted nuts, orange zest and honey, framed by a deft touch of new oak. On the palate, the wine is broad, deep and very powerful, with almost chewy structure and a long, penetrating finish. This is more blocky and foursquare than the Bienvenues, with perceptibly racier acidity, and it will require more time in the cellar.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
325,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Jean-Claude Ramonet's 2015 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is lovely, offering up a youthful but already expressive nose of white flowers, green pear, mint, blanched almonds and candied lime peel. On the palate, the wine is glossy, full-bodied and multidimensional—rich but vibrant—with a sapid, detailed finish. This year, it's qualitatively very close to the domaine's Bâtard-Montrachet.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 93
326,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes doesn't attain the same heights as the 2014 rendition, but it has handled the warmth of the vintage very well and remains quite classic in profile, with a very typical bouquet of pear, iodine, wheat toast, buttered apples and a framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is concentrated and full-bodied, with excellent amplitude and dimension, and a greater sense of reserve than any of the other 1er Crus in the cellar this year.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 93
327,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets is one of the real successes of the vintage at this address, wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of lime, dried white flowers, confit citrus and wheat toast. On the palate, the wine is glossy, concentrated and controlled, with compelling depth and dimension and an intense, racy finish. Elegant and complete, this is comparatively approachable for a young Caillerets, but it will repay some bottle age.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,RP 93
328,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers reveals a beautifully defined bouquet of citrus oil, lime, toasted nuts and fresh mint—the prelude to a medium-full, glossy wine with tensile acids, excellent depth and dimension and a long, precise finish. The Vergers often has one of the cooler profiles of the Ramonet's Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Crus, and that characteristic has served it well in the warm 2015 vintage.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,RP 92
329,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot is one of the least forthcoming wines in the cellar this year, and it will need a few years in the cellar to lose some of its baby fat. Its deep but reticent nose opens in the glass, revealing notes of pear, stone fruit and a touch of hazelnut—the prelude to a concentrated, foursquare and full-bodied wine with chewy extract and impressive depth. Classic Morgeot.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 92
330,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet,"This premier cru is situated high on the Puligny slope and typically produces a comparatively crisp, tensile wine, but Jean-Claude Ramonet's 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet is notably rich and ripe, bursting from the glass with an expressive nose of peach, toasted nuts, lemon oil and nutmeg. On the palate, the wine is glossy, full-bodied and concentrated, with almost chewy levels of extract and succulent rather than more typically racy acids. This should make for dramatic drinking in its youth.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet,RP 92
331,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte is already quite expressive, revealing a pretty bouquet of spring flowers, white peach and pastry cream—the prelude to an elegant mid-weight wine with an expansive, elegant, textural profile. It wouldn't be a crime to drink this in its youth. The Boudriotte is generally the most open knit and approachable of Ramonet’s Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Crus, typically being bottled in December, while the more serious 1er and Grand Crus spend additional time in barrel.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,RP 92
332,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Charmois,"The cooler macroclimates of Saint-Aubin seem to have fared especially well in this warm vintage, and the 2015 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Charmois is no exception: notes of nutty reduction, poached pear and citrus zest lead into a concentrated, glossy wine with more volume than the village Puligny or Chassagne. This stood out at its level for its textural elegance and balance.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Charmois,RP 92
333,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Puligny-Montrachet Les Enseignères,"Ramonet’s 2015 Puligny-Montrachet Les Enseignères reveals a classy and reserved bouquet of wet stones, lime zest, Meyer lemon and iodine, framed by creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is concentrated, layered and deep at the core, with lovely textural glossiness and detail underpinned by succulent acidity. The lieu-dit of Les Enseignères sits just below Bâtard-Montrachet, and this seems to have been a favored neighborhood in 2015, perhaps because the deeper soils retained sufficient water to preclude significant vine stress. Indeed, this is the domaine's standout Villages-level wine in 2015.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Puligny-Montrachet Les Enseignères,RP 92
334,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées is a lovely wine, offering up a youthful nose of preserved lemon and toasted nuts, framed by light reduction and a deft touch of new oak. On the palate, the wine is cool, medium-full and nicely tensile for a 2015, with a deep, saline mid-palate and a glossy, textural attack. This should give a great deal of pleasure over a decade or more.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées,RP 92
335,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles,"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles wafts from the glass with a pretty bouquet of spring flowers, honeysuckle and white peach. On the palate, this is a glossy mid-weight wine with more tension and a slenderer frame than the village Chassagne this year, though it's still comparatively open knit and giving. This cuvée is a recent addition to the Ramonet portfolio, debuting in the 2012 vintage, and its floral, elegant personality means that it complements the domaine's better-established bottlings very nicely.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Pernand-Vergelesses Les Belles Filles,RP 92
336,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Puligny-Montrachet Villages,"More restrained than its Chassagne sibling, the 2015 Puligny-Montrachet Villages displays a classic bouquet of peach, white flowers, blanched almonds, citrus zest and a subtle framing of toasty new wood. On the palate, the wine is glossy and textural on the attack, with excellent cut and length. A few years in the cellar are in order here.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Puligny-Montrachet Villages,RP 92
337,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet Villages,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet Villages is one of the most overtly ripe, sun-kissed wines in the cellar this year, and it's already beginning to get quite exotic, offering up an expressive nose of buttered apples, tropical fruit, peach, mint and honey. On the palate, this is broad, textural and rich, already precociously open knit. While this reveals greater tension and restraint than the rather buxom Bourgogne Blanc and offers a nice introduction to the domaine’s style, it's a candidate for near-term consumption.",2015 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet Villages,RP 92
338,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru is without doubt one of the wines of the vintage, and a real classic in the making. Aromas of tangerine oil, confit citrus, pear, toasted nuts and subtle spice introduce a generous, powerful wine with breathtaking balance and precision. There’s so much depth and incipient complexity wrapped up in its intricate structure; it's suppler than the Bâtard but no less tight knit. For all the fuss that is made of Montrachet, here is one wine that really lives up to the reputation of the vineyard and the domaine, which I’d argue is its greatest exponent. If this can survive for 20 years in the cellar, then it will be perfection itself.",2014 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
339,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru offers up notes of citrus zest, pastry cream, subtle noisette and a framing of new oak—the prelude to a wine that is notably more tight knit and unyielding than the Bienvenues. There’s lots of power and cut here, but so much is currently held in reserve, and cellaring will be essential to realize its full potential. Interestingly, one parcel of the Ramonet's holdings in Bâtard-Montrachet adjoins their parcel of Bienvenues, but the other parcel is in the middle of the vineyard on the border of Chassagne and Puligny, and perhaps that explains why these grands crus are generally so different.",2014 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
340,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes is a real classic, opening in the glass with notes of mint, apple, pear and subtle noisette, deftly framed by a touch of reduction and new oak. On the palate, the wine approaches grand cru concentration and depth, with a velouté texture, lovely controlled amplitude and terrific definition and length. While this will only really begin to realize all its potential with 5 or 6 years in the cellar, I confess to having already enjoyed almost a case of this wine off wine lists in Burgundy; every bottle has been superb.",2014 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
341,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers reveals a complex bouquet of pear, white peach, hazelnut and wet stones. On the palate, the wine is taut and precise, with lovely energy and sap underpinning its glossy, supple attack. This was tasted side by side with the 2015 rendition, and the contrast was interesting: while Ramonet's higher appellation 2015s have nice energy and freshness, the wines lead with their generous textures; with the 2014s, the order of appearance is reversed.",2014 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,RP 92
342,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet,"More tensile than the Ruchottes, with a reserved nose of white flowers, mint and citrus zest, the 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet is taut, vibrant and mineral, with impressive power and length. I have always tended to focus on the Ramonet's Chassagnes, but this, like the excellent Puligny Enseignères, is a persuasive argument for pursuing their Pulignys just as ardently as well as testimony to the quality of their range in 2014.",2014 Domaine Ramonet Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs-Canet,RP 92
343,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru is a beauty, opening in the decanter and glass with a complex bouquet of white flowers, Meyer lemon, honey and ripe pear, framed by light reduction and nicely integrated new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, supple and expansive, with a broad but weightless attack, incredible purity and superb focus through the long, detailed finish. This is an elegant, open-knit Montrachet, and one of the high points of the 2013 white Burgundy vintage.",2013 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
344,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,"Ramonet's 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte is drinking beautifully, wafting from the glass with a pretty nose of honey, white flowers and crisp orchard fruit that may reveal a light glaze of the botrytis that affected a number of 2013 white Burgundies. On the palate, the wine is medium-full and open knit, with a supple, silkily expansive attack, a sapid mid-palate and a pure, detailed finish. The Boudriotte is generally one of the more elegant and giving bottlings in the Ramonet cellar, and the 2013 is no exception.",2013 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,RP 92
345,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was served after the domaine's 2014 Montrachet—a hard act to follow, but it made a valiant effort. Since I last encountered it a year ago, the wine has become quite exotic, with an extravagant nose of white peach, petrol, iodine and tangerine oil. On the palate, the wine is ample, concentrated and generous but rather heavier and missing some of the energy displayed by the wonderfully restrained and vibrant 2014 Bâtard. It appears to be evolving quite rapidly, so this is a good candidate for near-term consumption.",2012 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
346,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru from Ramonet is already quite accessible, offering up an attractive bouquet of apple, white peach, pastry cream, spring flowers and oak vanillin, followed by a typically glossy, expansive palate impression. I have some reservations, however, about how open knit the wine is on the palate, and a firmer core and more acidic cut to balance this wine's generous body would auger better for the long haul. As it is, this is a Bienvenues to approach in the near term, and I plan to follow that advice with my remaining bottles.",2012 Domaine Ramonet Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
347,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,"Ramonet's 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers is one of the highlights of their range in what is a rather open-knit vintage for the domaine, the tension of the site tempering the year's tendency to corpulence. An expressive and quite dramatic nose of buttery orchard fruit, pastry cream and a framing of smoky new oak leads into a full-bodied, penetrating and glossily textural wine with bright acids and quite an open, generous core of fruit. This is drinking very well now, and it's probably not a vintage to cellar for the long haul.",2012 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Vergers,RP 92
348,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte is very charming, with a lovely bouquet of lime zest, ripe pear, wheat toast and creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is glossy and quite open knit, with nice integration and decent acidity. Right now, this doesn't look like a long-distance runner, and it's actually surprisingly reminiscent of the 2009 rendition, despite 2012 and 2009 being very different vintages.",2012 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Boudriotte,RP 92
349,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2011 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is very attractive, opening up in the decanter to offer a classic young Ramonet bouquet of lemon oil, mint, honeyed pear, white flowers and a framing of toasty new oak. On the palate, the wine is fresh and vibrant, with a broad and elegantly glossy attack, but it ranks as a comparatively open-knit rendition of this great wine, without the depth, structure or complexity of the very best vintages. Of course, it's an excellent Bâtard nonetheless.",2011 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
350,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"Ramonet's 2010 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes is superb, and it's beginning to drink very well, opening in the glass with a complex bouquet of lime, green pear, iodine and cornmeal, framed by light reduction and some nicely integrated smoky new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium-full, tensile and vibrant, with lovely textural gloss, superb depth at the core and an almost saline finish. This shares a number of characteristics with the 2014 Ruchottes, but it's a touch finer boned and less powerful. A beautiful example of the Domaine's emblematic wine.",2010 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
351,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2010 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets is superb in 2010, a great vintage for the domaine. A striking bouquet of lemon oil, green pear, wet rocks and spring flowers is followed by a medium-full wine with great cut, searing minerality and terrific concentration. This is a focused, structured wine that is cruising along in the cellar and should drink well for many years to come.",2010 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,RP 92
352,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"The 2010 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot offers eloquent testimony to just how fine a vintage this is chez Ramonet, opening in the glass with lovely notes of green apple, citrus oil, oatmeal and spring flowers. On the palate, there is a cut and precision that is often lacking from this sometimes-foursquare bottling, which balances the wine's nicely glossy texture. This is still youthful and aging gracefully.",2010 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 92
353,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Revisiting the 2009 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru for the first time in over a year, I was delighted to see that it is continuing to drink very well, opening in the decanter and glass with a lovely bouquet of buttered apples, pastry cream, pear, popcorn and fresh mint, its new oak nicely integrated. On the palate, the wine is ample but tightly coiled at the core, with a glossy, broad attack and chalky grip on the long, precise finish. This shows none of the heaviness that afflicts some of the 2009 white Burgundies and should make for quite dramatic drinking over the next handful of years.",2009 Domaine Ramonet Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
354,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"My last bottle of the 2009 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes was cruising along beautifully at age nine, and if the wine hadn't been so delicious in its youth, I might be inclined to regret drinking up my case too soon. Aromas of lemon, green pear, wheat toast and honeysuckle burst from the glass, with deeper notes of ripe yellow orchard fruit emerging with air. On the palate, the wine is texturally seamless and seductive, structurally wide open but deep at the core, with a sapid, intense finish.",2009 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
355,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"From an underrated white Burgundy vintage, Ramonet's 1993 1er Cru Les Ruchottes is fully mature and drinking very well. A bouquet of buttered yellow orchard fruit, honey, creamy field mushroom and iodine precedes a glossy, medium-full wine with succulent acids, creamy texture, good structural integrity despite its mature profile and a sapid, intense palate. Note that at this age, bottle variation is likely.",1993 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
356,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,"Some of the 1993 red Burgundies are beginning to drink beautifully, as their structural elements melt away to reveal wines of beautiful precision and transparency, and Ramonet’s 1993 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte is a textbook example. Pretty aromas of dried rose petal, red-black cherry, grilled game bird and forest floor precede an ample, medium-full wine with a fine-grained chassis of chalky tannins that is taut without being austere. The sweetness and scale of this wine’s core of fruit suggest that chaptalization might have been a touch heavy handed, which keeps the score down a few points, but this is still quite reserved and could benefit from another 5 years in the cellar.",1993 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Boudriotte,RP 92
357,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"This bottle of the 1990 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes was showing just a touch of oxidation in its complex bouquet, but the wine's inherent vigor and depth make me suspect that this was simply a slightly advanced bottle and that there are still pristine examples out there. The nose reveals lovely notes of confit citrus, iodine, beeswax and oatmeal, with hints of vanilla and fino sherry. On the palate, the wine is ample and glossy, with great concentration and depth and lovely precision and grip on the long, focused finish despite the rather evolved character of the nose. A wine I'd love to encounter again.",1990 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
358,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,"The 1997 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes was missing some definition on the nose, had just light touches of white flowers, but I could not discern much in the way of terroir expression. The palate is powerful, almost viscous in texture, low acidity with a dense finish. If it were not almost 20 years old you might think it was suffering premature oxidation. It is not. It is just a Chassagne-Montrachet that is a bit long in the tooth. Tasted December 2016.",1997 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Ruchottes,RP 92
359,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1978 Montrachet Grand Cru, tasted in Beaune, had an amber/honey color. The nose is fully matured with marmalade, quince and orange cordial, a little smudged and with an adhesive note that becomes more intense with time. I was hoping that it would magically clear up and become more detailed, but...it doesn't. The palate is rich on the entry with what feels like a bit of botrytis. There is great weight and power here, but it feels fatigued and clearly lacks tension. There is some pleasure to be found on the Sauternes-like finish, but otherwise...well, let's just say I did not finish my glass. Tasted November 2015. ",1978 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
360,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"Tasted at The Portland restaurant in London, the Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot 1987 is one of those wines that reminds you how great mature white Burgundy can be, when it's not premoxed! The key to this wine is aeration. First pour and the chips are down: a little musty, that ominous fug of dried honey hinting at the dreaded premox. But wait. Allowing it 20 minutes to open the aromatics are like a sky clearing of cloud and the sunshine of mineralité floods in. The palate suitably shapes up, revealing a keen line of acidity, lovely grilled walnut and smoky notes with fine precision on the finish. The 1987 vintage was purportedly a great wine for Ramonet. This wine attests to that, though I personally would pop any corks over the next four or five years. ",1987 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 92
361,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"After a lackluster showing of the 1991 Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet earlier this year, the 1991 Montrachet Grand Cru was better, but ""no great shakes."" It has a divine nose, for sure, with citrus fruit, mint, Mirin and spice with fabulous definition. So far, so fab. But the palate does not quite strike the same chord and feels rather conservative, perhaps unambitious, content to trade on its illustrious name rather than deliver a transcendental experience. ",1994 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
362,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1991 Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet here sports a burnished gold color, perhaps too deep, even considering it's 23 years old. The nose is fully mature with honeycomb, nougat and almond, and not as well-defined as other Montrachet that I have tasted from this era. The palate is burly and powerful with good weight: smoked walnut, dried honey and nutmeg, leading do a rather dry finish. I do not think this is a case of premature oxidization, just this would suggest that this grand cru is past its best.",1991 Domaine Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92
363,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"The 2008 Morgeot feels just a little smudged on the nose, perhaps illuminated more by the precision of the 2006 Bienvenue tasted alongside. It does actually ameliorate in the glass to reveal light resin, jasmine and lanolin scents. There is a twist of orange peel lacing the entry on the palate, commendable acidity with some fatness coming through on the finish, although, as often is the case with Morgeot, it is missing a little finesse. Drink now-2020+. ",2008 Domaine Ramonet Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,RP 92
364,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"I have loved this wine the two or three times I have tasted it and this is easily the best bottle I have encountered. The nose here is much more immediate, with a stunning mineral nose, hints of brioche coming through like last time, but with even more precision and focus, flinty scents developing with time. The palate is clean, tense and refined with hazelnut and quince, a weightlessness and poise that is quite hypnotic. This is one of my favorite white Burgundy wines, and this 2006 is impressive. Excellent. Drink now-2022. ",2006 Domaine Ramonet Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 92

It is displaying lively, fresh aromas of minerals, pears, spice and, with time, spearmint. On the palate this wine has superb concentration, extraction, breadth, and powerful toasty oak, poached pears spiced with cloves and juniper berries, and stones. At this stage in its evolution it is rather disjointed, its flavor profile dominated by alcohol and oak, but all the elements are there for future greatness. Although it requires a minimum of 7-8 years for its core of fruit to evolve, it will easily last until 2025.

408,Jean-Claude Ramonet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"On January 17, 1997, a Belgian wine merchant held a comprehensive tasting of virtually every  Montrachet at the Crillon Hotel in Paris. In addition to myself, Pierre Rovani was the only other American in attendance. The group was evenly split between members of the Belgian/French wine trade and private consumers. I was permitted to insert several top California Chardonnays in the tasting as ""ringers."" I provided the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge and the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. The tasting was impeccably organized, with the wines served blind in multiple flights. The results, although not unbelievable to me, were shocking to the group of serious Belgian and French wine tasters. Two of the French tasters were well-known winemakers. One of them who asked to remain anonymous proclaimed that in large part, the group of Montrachets was ""a crime against France's patrimony."" The group overwhelmingly rated the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge the top wine. Several tasters recognized that it was a California wine, but they still felt it was by far the most compelling, complex, and complete wine of the tasting. Second place went to another ""ringer,"" the  Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Le Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, third place was awarded to the  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne another ringer, and fourth place went to yet another ""ringer,"" the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. Of the Montrachets, three producers produced wines that certainly merited outstanding ratings. The fifth place wine was the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti  Montrachet; sixth place went to Domaine Lafon's  Montrachet; and seventh place was the  Domaine Ramonet Montrachet.

My numerical ratings generally mirrored the group's, with the Peter Michael Pointe Rouge receiving 97 points, Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, 95;  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne, 96+; Mount Eden 1992 Chardonnay Estate, 94; DRC  Montrachet, 93; Domaine Lafon  Montrachet, 91+; Domaine Ramonet  Montrachet, 90+; and most of the other Montrachets in the mid to upper-eighties, except for the appalling  Montrachets from Delagrange-Bachelet and Rene Fleurot. A tropical fruit-scented, disjointed the acidity stuck out as it does in many New World Chardonnays  Robert Drouhin Montrachet Marquis de la Guiche was another underachiever. Only four of the Montrachets possessed the depth and richness or the group's top three wines. Perhaps the most remarkable conclusion of this tasting was that none of the Montrachets displayed the complexity of the group's favorite three wines. And let's not hear any whining about these Montrachets needing 5-10, perhaps 15 years of cellaring. That may be the case in vintages such as 1986 or 1995, but the  Montrachets are extremely forward, low acid wines except those that appeared to have had far too much acidity added. Too many of them were diluted, disjointed, flabby, and flat compared to the non-Montrachet wines of this tasting.

Much is being made in European wine writing circles about American versus European tastes, another phony non-issue by writers who would better serve their readership by doing more tasting than pontificating. While no single tasting can be considered definitive, this particular tasting did prove that a group of French and Belgian tasters exhibited a preference for California Chardonnays. C'est la vie.

Wouldn't you like to be the lucky recipient of some of that wine?  The two barrels that will be estate-bottled come from 70-year old vines.  It is an awesomely rich, full-bodied, massive wine oozing with fruit and that distinctive steely, mineral-like Montrachet character.  As usual, the price will be astronomical.  This magnificent Montrachet will drink well for 15-20 years.

As a sidelight, while discussing Noel Ramonet's favorite Le Montrachets, he proceeded to open the 1978, the only vintage of Ramonet's Le Montrachet that I had never tasted.  The wine exhibits a deep golden color, but is extremely austere and backward.  It appears capable of lasting another 15-20 years.  It is one of those wines that is impressive more for its structure and potential longevity than for its depth of fruit or hedonistic virtues.  The 1990 and 1983 Le Montrachets are Noel's favorites. He feels the 1982 should be consumed (I agree).  Moreover, he thinks 1982 and 1989 are better than 1986 (I disagree).

As a sidelight, while discussing Noel Ramonet's favorite Le Montrachets, he proceeded to open the 1978, the only vintage of Ramonet's Le Montrachet that I had never tasted.  The wine exhibits a deep golden color, but is extremely austere and backward.  It appears capable of lasting another 15-20 years.  It is one of those wines that is impressive more for its structure and potential longevity than for its depth of fruit or hedonistic virtues.  The 1990 and 1983 Le Montrachets are Noel's favorites. He feels the 1982 should be consumed (I agree).  Moreover, he thinks 1982 and 1989 are better than 1986 (I disagree).

Many of the 1988 white burgundies remind me of the lean, acidic, frequently undernourished 1981s.  Few 1988s can be called superbly concentrated, but the best examples are good to excellent.  Ramonet's 1988 Montrachet should prove to be long-lived given its high acidity and sleek, compact style.  As good as the wine is, however, it is hardly dazzling.  A reticent nose offers up aromas of honeyed apples, butter, and toast.  In the mouth, this medium-bodied wine exhibits fine concentration, high acidity, and a moderately long finish.

Every time I tasted this wine between 1987 and 1990 I bestowed it a perfect score.  However, at several recent tastings the wine has begun to display less than an other-worldly character.  At its best, it was one of the most viscous, oily white burgundies I have ever tasted.  The only wine that vaguely resembled it was the 1980 Chalone Chardonnay - amazing as that may sound.  While it is still concentrated, broad-shouldered, and powerful, its freshness is not as apparent, and its high alcohol is noticeable in the finish.

Some readers may have rated this wine higher, but I thought the alcohol level was excessive - probably close to 15%.

This is always among the deepest and richest of all Ramonet's wines, including his grands crus.  However, along with the Montrachet, it is also the most backward.  The 1989 is no exception.

In the mouth, it is deep and ripe, with great structure and persistence on the palate.  This tightly knit, superbly concentrated wine will open up in 2-4 years and last for at least 10-12.

Sooner or later most white burgundy lovers make the pilgrimage to the village of Chassagne-Montrachet and pay a visit to the Domaine Ramonet.  Legendary wines frequently emerge from these cellars and for that reason, only the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti's Montrachet sells for a higher price than that of Ramonet.  However, other wines in their portfolio often make a more sensible purchase.
