0,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"2016 was a superb vintage in Rioja, and the 2016 Viña Gravonia Blanco, which has the cellar aroma that all the wines, especially the whites, have, due to the longer time the wines spend in barrel. The white vines in this vineyard are now 92 years old and their juice was fermented in old oak vats with indigenous yeasts. They explained, ""We have never used selected yeasts."" It was matured in their well-seasoned American oak barrels for four years. It's paler than any of the other whites, and it has a little less pungency, with very good freshness. It's elegant, subtle, clean and ethereal. They had good yields and a good climatic year. 42,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2022. I give these wines a conservative drinking window, but they will probably last much longer.",2016 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
1,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2016 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza was surprising, spectacular, elegant, clean and fresh like few vintages before. It was a superb year, with quality, quantity and freshness. It's quite the opposite from the previous 2015, which was a much warmer and riper year. The 2016s have moderate alcohol and especially the perception of less ripeness (even though the alcohol is very similar). It feels very young, still quite primary. Mercedes explained, ""Cubillas, a 24-hectare plot, is a vineyard that could produce Gran Reserva wines. It's a very good vineyard, but we would miss the Crianza in our range"". In fact, the comment was that this vintage is even a challenge for the Viña Tondonia red ""because of its price."" It is indeed a bargain. ""But it doesn't have the finesse of Tondonia,"" concluded María José. Anyway, it's super tasty. 92,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2022.",2016 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
2,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"We talked a lot about the challenging 2013, but they defended the wines. ""There was a big crop, and it was not easy, but it was possible to make great wines."" The 2013 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva has nutty aromas, perhaps showing a little more development, but according to Mercedes López de Heredia, ""[With] the old vines with the right rootstock, in the right soils, you can have more or less quality, but you're not going to have a disaster."" It's a wine that has to have aging potential, and they need to start with good grapes, so they harvested earlier, as their grapes were riper because they had lowered their yields. They took risks, and I think they got it right. The palate has intense and pungent flavors, a velvety mouthfeel and a vibrant core of acidity, with a fine thread and a chalky finish. But it's a slightly weaker year. 14,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in April 2022.",2013 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
3,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The 2013 Viña Bosconia Reserva even in a cooler and rainier year, like 2013, has a rounder body and still 13.5% alcohol. They also insisted that ""remember that we can use 15% of wine from another vintage, and perhaps we topped this one up with wine from 2015. We want consistency year after year."" This matured in barrels for five years and was bottled unfiltered but fined with egg whites. It's expressive, elegant and subtle, clean and complex, with polished tannins and very good acidity (pH 3.3 and 6.7 grams of tartaric acid per liter of wine). 70,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2021.",2013 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
4,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"The 2012 Viña Tondonia Reserva comes from a very dry year, with 25% less rain than the average (at the time), resulting in lower yields of very healthy grapes that delivered wines with nice balance between alcohol and polyphenols, making it very apt for the aging in barrel. It had a slightly longer élevage in barrel, six years. The wine is aromatic with a developed profile, spicy and tertiary (forest floor, a touch of brick dust and iodine), complex and nuanced. The palate is full and round, with polished tannins and a long, dry finish. It has a textbook Tondonia nose and profile. 250,000 bottles produced.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
5,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"I was very much looking forward to the 2004 Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva, the next vintage of this wine after the spectacular 2001. 2004 was a perfect climate year. This is a developed white that was matured in well-seasoned, neutral American oak barrels for 10 years in their old caves, where the wine gets pungent aromas of mushrooms, pollen, beeswax, white pepper, kerosene, cereals and something herbal (celery and even asparagus) that reminded me of the 1964. The palate is velvety and dry and super tasty, with a salty twist in the finish. It's still a baby even after years in bottle. This should age superbly in bottle. I think this is slightly better than the 2001, one of the freshest and most elegant vintages for this bottling. Bravo! 10,000 bottles were filled in November 2018. Before and after aging in barrel, the Gran Reserva wines also spend some time in oak vats.",2004 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,RP 95
6,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"The 2004 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva didn't stop growing and changing in the glass for the good three hours that lasted the tasting of the portfolio. I had tasted this wine on my previous visit (they don't usually open future Gran Reserva vintages), and I was very impressed. This was aromatic (but took some time in the glass to open up), floral, perfumed, elegant and nuanced. The year was excellent, textbook, and the grapes from Viña Tondonia were picked from the 11th of October, the dates from yesteryear. I had the exceptional 2001 Parreno two weeks before I tasted this wine, and I found many similarities between both wines. It has complex notes of forest floor, truffle, wild herbs, spices and mushrooms and a touch of iodine. This is velvety, with super elegant tannins and a supple finish. It has clout and persistence, but there's also something ethereal about it. It's full of energy, light and power. This should be almost eternal. Bravo! 24,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2018.",2004 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,RP 95
7,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva,"The 2004 Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva is very open, expressive and aromatic right away—as soon as it was poured into the glass—while the Tondonia took time to open up. This has a very elegant nose, and despite having less Garnacha than the Tondonia, it has a more Garnacha nose, a little heady with notes of cherries in liqueur and iodine (think Rayas). It has an elegant texture, very fine tannins and pungent flavors, and it's persistent and powerful while keeping balance and freshness. The Bosconia Vineyard is a cooler vineyard that delivers fresher wines; the grapes were picked quite late, from the 20th of October, later than the ones from the Tondonia vineyard. Only 6,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in March 2019. Some of these vintages have had a much longer élevage, though not necessarily all in barrel, as the wines also spent time in the ancient oak vats.",2004 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva,RP 95
8,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva,"The 1947 Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva blew me away. It could have been my favorite of the Riojas, up there with the best Bordeaux (to me, Petrus and surprisingly enough Margaux!). It is amazingly dark, juicy and glowy, with a very young and dark cherry color and surprising acidity. Viña Bosconia is a relatively small vineyard of only 15 hectares, so production was not as much as that of the Viña Tondonia. It's juicy and lush, with notes of forest floor, truffle, smoked cured dry meat and orange peel denoting, freshness. The tannins are fully resolved, and it has a velvety texture; it's elegant and long. Super tasty, really pleasant and gourmand.",1947 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva,RP 95
9,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"According to María José López de Heredia, the frost from 1945 affected the following vintages, including the 1947, and they didn't have a great vintage until 1954. The red 1947 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva, bottled in a Bordeaux bottle (compared with the Viña Real that comes in a Burgundy bottle), has some similarities with the Imperial from CVNE, also in a Bordeaux bottle and showcasing the finer Haro style of more serious and austere wines when compared with the more sensual, round and powerful Viña Bosconia (or Viña Real) bottled in a Burgundy bottle. I find more evolution and more volatile acidity here, a more evolved and polished wine. There might be some bottle variation because of the corks (in general, the CVNE corks were better), because I've had better bottles of the 1947 than the two we uncorked for the occasion of this tasting. Tondonia is a much larger vineyard—100 hectares—than  Bosconia (only 15 hectares), but the surface in production is not always 100%. Even so, there are always more bottles of Viña Tondonia than the scarcer Viña Bosconia.",1947 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,RP 95
10,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"Unfortunately, the only bottle María José López de Heredia could find of the white 1947 Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva was past its best, with a low fill and a brownish color. She said she had never had the wine before. I didn't have any data points about if, so I cannot make any comments. But I've had superb bottles that were slightly younger and some older that were magnificent, so the performance of this bottle doesn't have to be representative of the vintage as a whole.",1947 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,RP 95
11,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2015 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza reflects the warmer conditions of the year, and with the riper fruit they picked to produce this wine, they still managed to keep around 13.5% alcohol. The Cubillo vineyard has more clay, and sometimes clay soils take heat better and make the wines fresher than those from poorer soils. 140,000 bottles produced.",2015 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
12,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"2015 was considered a very good vintage, because it was warm, dry and healthy, and the 2015 Viña Gravonia Blanco has a little more alcohol at 13%—only half a degree makes a big difference, and the wine is not as lively as other cooler vintages. For María José López de Heredia, the wine is too alcoholic; the vintage had perfect ripeness and the grapes were super healthy, but the wine lacks the citrus freshness and the vibrancy Gravonia should have. 27,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2021. The wine matured for four years in well-seasoned American oak barrels.",2015 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
13,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"The 2014 Viña Gravonia Blanco always smells of the cellar with some mushroomy aromas and flavors, and it's very classical, with 12.5% alcohol, more vibrant than the 2015 I tasted next to it. To María José López de Heredia, Gravonia has to be very fresh with citrus freshness and some nuttiness but without the bitterness of the aged Tondonia, which they compare with the Carbonieux and such wines from Graves. These are ancient vines and the grapes are pristine. 25,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2021. They bottled later because of COVID-19, and the extra time was spent mostly in oak vat but maybe some in barrel...",2014 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
14,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2014 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza is a textbook vintage with some aromatic development, notes of fresh blood and some grainy tannins, perhaps less polished than previous vintages, lively and concentrated, a bit harsh. 2014 was a very rainy vintage. This is usually a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho and 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo matured in well-seasoned, neutral American oak barrels for three years. 150,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2020.",2014 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
15,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"2013 was a very tough vintage when they had to discard up to 100,000 kilograms of grapes and production of most of the wines was lower; it's also the year when their father died, and they were very encouraged to make very good wines. The 2013 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza is the entry-level red from that year, the cooler of the shortlist of 2013, 2014 and 2015 I tasted next to each other. The wine is more austere even within the style they say is their wine for the by-the-glass market. It's classical and developed with a polished palate after three years in barrel. It overdelivers for the conditions of the year. 90,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2019.",2013 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
16,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,"I love the rosé 2012 Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva, perhaps the finest vintage (together with the 2010) of the modern releases produced again since 2008. It's a textbook example of this unusual rosé a blend of 60% Garnacho (they use the masculine form of the name of the grape), 30% Tempranillo and 10% Viura that matured in American oak barrels for four years, during which time the wine acquired an orange color and a nutty nose with notes of candied orange peel, mushroom and forest floor. It's only 12.5% alcohol and has a pH of 3.3. 15,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in April 2018.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,RP 95
17,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"The next vintage of the white reserva will be released around February 2023 and will be the 2012 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva. It has marked notes of mushroom, which is what you get when you enter their cellars, in a warm and dry vintage that is still more vibrant. 16,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2020.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
18,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The 2012 Viña Bosconia Reserva is perhaps a little too young (María José López de Heredia likes more polished wines, and for her this wine was too tough), with some tannins and the chalky texture from the limestone soils. This blend of Tempranillo with 15% Garnacho and 5% between Graciano and Mazuelo matured in used American oak barrels for five years. 80,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2019.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
19,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"The 2011 Viña Tondonia Reserva is darker and shows riper fruit, a rounder palate and some dusty tannins. A year of ripeness, concentration and tannin, the wine is powerful with the finesse of Tondonia. Tasting this next to the textbook 2010 Tondonia revealed how this has more muscle and a wider back and the 2010 epitomizes the finesse and elegance. 270,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2019.",2011 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
20,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"The 2011 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva reflects a warm and ripe year, and the wine is more evolved and already hints at some caramel and honey. It has a mellow palate without the vibrancy of the 2010 I tasted next to it. This wine matured in used, ancient American oak barrels for six years. 19,000 bottles were filled in November 2019.",2011 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
21,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"2011 was a warmer and riper year, but there's not a huge difference between the 2011 Viña Bosconia Reserva and the 2010; this is perhaps mellower, with more integrated acidity. It's 13.5% alcohol with a pH of 3.3 and 6.7 grams of acidity measured in tartaric acid per liter, and it fermented in the 144-year-old oak vats and matured in used American oak barrels for five years. 88,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2018.",2011 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
22,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"2010 was one of the finest vintages in recent times, and the 2010 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva is the textbook fine and elegant white where the 90% Viura is complemented by the 10% Malvasía and, according to María José López de Heredia, gives a mellower profile (honey and some more creaminess) and compensates for the bitter almond notes of Viura and the austerity, making the wine a little rounder. This is a phenomenal vintage of the white Tondonia, vibrant, balanced and fresh. 16,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2018.",2010 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
23,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"The 2010 Viña Tondonia Reserva has all I expect from a Reserva from Tondonia, complexity, elegance and evolution, a developed nose with notes of forest floor and wild berries, herbs and flowers, a touch of iodine, brick dust and very fine, polished tannins. It has the seriousness and elegance of Tondonia. This is a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho (they use the masculine form of the name of the grape) and 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo that fermented in the ancient oak vats from when the winery was created 144 years ago and matured in well-seasoned, American oak barrels for six years. It has 13% alcohol, a pH of 3.4 and 6.6 grams of acidity. 260,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2017.",2010 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
24,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The fresh and balanced 2010 Viña Bosconia Reserva is a textbook example of the wine, perhaps the successor of the great 2006, a powerful blend of 80% Tempranillo, 15% Garnacha and 5% between Graciano and Mazuelo. It matured in used American oak barrels for five years and is clean and complex with a nutty and mushroomy nose, polished tannins and good acidity. 80,000 bottles were filled in May 2017.",2010 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
25,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"I had the chance to taste a bottle of the 2001 Viña Tondonia Reserva 10 years after it was released, and the wine has evolved beautifully and quite slowly—at least that is the case for these bottles that have been kept in the winery for all these years. It's austere and elegant, with balance and concentration, polished tannins and a chalky texture, long tasty and dry. This is lively and should continue developing in bottle for quite some time...",2001 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
26,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Joven,"The 2000 Viña Tondonia Joven is one-off, a wine that was bottle to complete a box set released for the 125th anniversary of the winery. At that time, nobody wanted traditional Gran Reserva wines, and there was a push from the market for López de Heredia to produce young wines with a short time in oak. The idea of the box set was for people to uncork a Gran Reserva, a Reserva and a Joven at the same time. I did with some friends, but some 20 years after they had released these special wines that had a custom and very un-Tondonia label. The ""young"" wine was the real surprise. It showed very well, still quite lively, juicy, balanced and fresh with focused and clean aromas and flavors showing youth. María José López de Heredia told me they had to bottle it with very little stabilization, as they didn't have any refrigeration or filtering systems. Well, it showed great!",2000 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Joven,RP 95
27,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"I think the mid-nineties were an era of more ripeness, extraction and oak even in the more traditional wineries, and a bottle of the 1994 Viña Tondonia Reserva—with a different label and sold as part of a box set that also includes the 1977 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva and a one-off ""joven"" 2000 Viña Tondonia—shows the effect of that era. The wine is round and a little creamy, ripe and juicy, with glossy tannins and a lush personality but without the character, finesse and nuance of other vintages. The wine is ready and should stay like that for years, but I don't foresee it improving in bottle.",1994 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
28,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"The rare 1977 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva was only released as part of a box set to celebrate the winery's 125th anniversary in 2002 and with a different and unusual label. It was not a great vintage in Rioja, but they selected it because it was the vintage of their 100th anniversary that had never been released. María José López de Heredia told me it was not a great vintage but apparently some bottles show really well. The one I had was austere and narrow, with a note of iron and blood, reminiscent of rusty nails. It's medium-bodied, sharp with polished tannins and an earthy austerity.",1977 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,RP 95
29,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"The 2013 Viña Gravonia Blanco comes from a rainy, cool and challenging vintage when the grapes didn't reach the perfect ripeness the 2012 (that I tasted next to it) displayed. It has citrus notes (orange peel, yuzu) and an herbal twist, balsamic with the unmistakably white López de Heredia aroma of mushrooms that you smell as soon as you enter their ancient cellars. It's quite pale, and the palate is sharp and austere, quite light but with the pungent flavors and a long and tasty finish. This is a relatively simple wine, especially when compared with the others. 18,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in September 2018 after four years in American barrels.",2013 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
30,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"2012 was a very complete vintage in Rioja, even if it was quite dry, and the 2012 Viña Gravonia Blanco shows superbly. It's very intense, with two levels of complexity, intensity and depth above the 2013 I tasted next to it. It has the textbook aromas of lanolin, diesel, mushroom, yellow dried flowers and chamomile, with perfect ripeness. The palate is round and glyceric, quite lush, and leaves your umami-laden mouth with a salty finish. This should develop nicely in bottle, one of the best vintages of Gravonia of recent times. The wine has 12.5% alcohol and amazing acidity measures. 15,000 bottles produced. This was bottled in November 2017 after four years in American oak barrels.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
31,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"I was quite impressed by the 2012 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza, a classical Rioja that is nicely crafted, with less aging in barrel than the rest of reds and therefore with more fruit character and less López de Heredia signature. This was born as a red for tapas, a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho and 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo with 13.5% alcohol. It matured in well-seasoned American oak barrels for three years. It has ripe fruit (black rather than red) without excess and a pinch of spices and a twist of oak. 94,500 bottles produced. There are seven lots of this. I tasted a bottled that was filled in May 2018.",2012 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
32,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,"2011 is a warmer and riper year in Rioja than 2010, which was a superb vintage, and the 2011 Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva suffers when tasted next to the 2010. It has candied fruit and a much riper profile but with the classical old oak and mushroom aromas of Tondonia. The color is less bright than the 2010, and there are already some brick-going-to-brown tones. There is some lightness in the palate with moderate acidity and refreshing notes of watermelon and rose petals. 12,000 bottles were filled in April 2017.",2011 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,RP 95
33,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,"The 2010 Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva was hitting on all cylinders. It was produced with 60% Garnacho (they use the masculine of the name here), 30% Tempranillo and 10% white Viura from vines averaging 91 years of age. Like all the wines, it fermented with indigenous yeasts (they have never used selected yeasts) in the 142 oak vats they have used since the beginning and then matured in old American oak barrels for four years. There is tons of complexity and nuance here; it's super elegant and layered, and as the wine sat in the glass, it developed more and more complex aromas, a subtle combination of balsam, red acid berries, a hint of medicine, fennel and wet chalk, a diesel-like touch, old wood and mushroom (beetroot?), licorice and yellow flowers, sweet spices...  There's a lot more of everything. It's clean and crystalline, fresh and long, with terrific balance and depth. This has to be the finest rosado of recent times... 25,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in April 2016.",2010 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,RP 95
34,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"2009 was a very warm year, and the 2009 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva, produced with Viura and 10% Malvasía Riojana from vines averaging 61 years of age, shows ripe and has more evolved aromas with honeyed notes, caramel, Earl Grey tea and a volatile whiff like it's more advanced. The palate feels more complete, with the textbook pungent flavors of fungus, diesel and wet chalk, and it's lighter than what I expected for a warm and dry year. This matured in well-seasoned, neutral American oak barrels for six years. I'd drink this before the 2008. This feels ready. 15,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2018.",2009 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
35,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"As with many wines this time, I had two vintages to taste of the Reserva from the Tondonia vineyard, 2009 and 2008, two very different, almost opposite vintages. The 2009 Viña Tondonia Reserva, a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho and 5% each Mazuelo and Graciano, matured in used American oak barrels for six years. It has some toasted character, with ripe fruit, black rather than red, denoting a warm year but more restrained than the Bosconia Reserva from the same vintage. 2009 is a year of ripeness, concentration and tannin; the wines are powerful, but here you see the finesse of Tondonia in comparison to the more rustic Viña Bosconia. 220,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2017.",2009 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
36,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The 2009 Viña Bosconia Reserva shows the ripeness of the very warm and dry year. It's structured and concentrated, quite different from the finesse of the Tondonia. Bosconia has always been more rustic and powerful and Tondonia all about finesse and nuance. There are dark plums and baking spices, a touch of singed leather, the fruit very strong to counterbalance the aging in barrel. This is a powerful Bosconia. 80,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2016.",2009 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
37,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"The 2008 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva has a subtle and elegant nose, shyer than the 2009, a little closed and undeveloped. It's a year with more acidity and less ripeness, with a combination of citrus and honey and a very dry sensation in the palate, a chalky mouthfeel. This feels undeveloped and in need of time in bottle to develop more nuance and complexity. This is a cooler and sharper wine than the 2012 Gravonia or the 2009 Tondonia Blanco. 10,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2017.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 95
38,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"The nose of the 2008 Viña Tondonia Reserva is very elegant, fresh and with an herbal twist, starting to show the complexity of the aged wines that are sometimes still too young when they are released 10+ years from the vintage! The palate is medium-bodied, with lightness and depth, very classical with extra freshness and all that is needed for a long development in bottle. This is the more Tondonia of the two vintages I tasted side by side. There are notes of maple syrup, smoke, licorice and crisp fruit. The palate is more austere, crunchy and reveals the chalkiness of the soils. There's more definition and precision here.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 95
39,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The profile of the 2008 Viña Bosconia Reserva is a lot less ripe than the 2009, and there are some herbal undertones; it's more reserved and austere, still undeveloped after five years in barrel and at least that much time in bottle. It's a blend of 80% Tempranillo, 15% Garnacho and the rest Graciano and Mazuelo that matured in used American oak barrels for five years. It reveals a medium body and some dusty tannins. It's quite the opposite from the 2009, and I think a hypothetical blend of the two would be better than each. It's a cold and austere vintage of Bosconia. 75,000 bottles produced. It was bottled unfiltered and fined with egg whites in four different lots, depending on logistics. It was bottled in November 2017.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 95
40,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"No white Gran Reserva had been produced since 1996, and the next vintage will be 2001. The 2001 Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva is a wine that has the textbook profile of a white Tondonia, with hints of diesel, mushroom, citrus and honey. The oak is still noticeable, and the wine feels young and with a long life ahead. 2001 was an extraordinary vintage, and the grapes were very healthy. They started picking the white grapes the 8th of October, and the last grapes were picked the 29th of October, with 21 days of good weather. The grapes ripened properly and thoroughly, and the wine has great balance for a long aging in bottle. This is 90% Viura and 10% Malvasía Riojana that fermented in their 153-year-old oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in used barrels for 10 years. It has 12.5% alcohol, a pH of 3.1 and 6.8 grams of acidity (tartaric). The palate has pungent flavors and great length. There is great balance and harmony, all the pieces are there to deliver a wine that is going to last 40 or more years. There is a Jura-like twist of rancid nuts and some spices in the nose, which is clearly above all the other whites, complex, layered, nuanced and intense. It has very pungent, penetrating flavors of mushroom and forest floor, more powerful but subtle, finishing with a pleasant bitter and salty twist. The complexity and balance here are brutal, with bitter, sweet, salty, acidity . . . and umami! This is approachable now and for the next decades! It has to be among the best Gran Reserva whites, a modern-day 1973? 5,000 bottles were filled after being fined with fresh egg whites in July 2012.",2001 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,RP 95
41,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"The 2001 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva is the follow-up of the 1995. There is a sense of harmony and elegance, of nuance and subtleness that wasn't quite the same in the Bosconia, as comparing both wines is inevitable. They started picking the red grapes the 15th of October, and the last grapes were picked the 29th of October with good weather. The grapes ripened properly and thoroughly, and the wine has great balance for a long aging in bottle. This is 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho and 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo that fermented in their 153-year-old oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in used barrels for 10 years. It has 13% alcohol, a pH of 3.4 and 6.4 grams of acidity (tartaric). The nose shows young (tasting it blind, you'd guess a 10-year old wine, not a 20-year-old wine!). It has a nose of sweet spices, underbrush and cigar ash, somewhat balsamic, bramble fruit with perfect ripeness, integrated and young but starting to show some tertiary complexity. The palate is velvety and medium-bodied, with fine-grained, chalky tannins denoting a limestone soil that brings finesse and texture and a sapid, tasty, almost salty finish. This is going to make a beautiful bottle of old Rioja in 30 years' time! 25,000 bottles produced. It was bottled after being fined with egg whites in July 2012.",2001 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,RP 95
42,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva,"The 2001 Viña Bosconia Gran Reserva fits the profile of the wine, a little riper (is it Garnacha?) with heady aromas and a touch of rusticity. 2001 saw good yields of very healthy grapes. They started picking the reds the 15th of October, and the last grapes were picked the 29th of October with good weather. The grapes ripened properly and thoroughly, and the wine has great balance for a long aging in bottle. This is 80% Tempranillo, 15% Garnacho and the rest Graciano and Mazuelo that fermented in their 153-year-old oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in used barrels for 10 years. It has 13% alcohol, a pH of 3.4 and 6.5 grams of acidity (tartaric). As the wine sat in the glass (even overnight), it became finer and subtler. 5,000 bottles produced.

43,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"The white that will be sold from October or November 2019, the 2011 Viña Gravonia Blanco comes from a warmer year with very low yields, and the wine is already showing some tertiary notes, with very subtle diesel-like hints. The palate is bone dry with some nutty undertones and a salty/bitter finish. These are whites for food. 18,667 bottles were filled in November 2016, at the same time as the 2010, which means this had a shorter élevage (probably the sign of a slightly weaker year).",2011 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
44,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"It's not easy to follow a 2010, but the 2011 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza improves with time in the glass, showing much better than expected. 2011 was a warmer year than the 2010, and the wine is a little riper but has great balance and very good harmony. It's a noteworthy red for the price asked. 90,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in April 2017.",2011 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 95
45,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"2010 was a superb vintage in Rioja, and the white 2010 Viña Gravonia Blanco is simply stunning, the best of the three vintages I tasted together (2009, 2010 and 2011). This is from a cooler and very balanced year that is perfectly reflected in the wine. The wine is evolving slowly, with notes of lemon curd, dried yellow flowers, saffron and spices. The palate reveals real energy, great balance and a very tasty, almost salty finish. This has to be one of the best vintages for Viña Gravonia. 14,500 bottles were filled in November 2016.",2010 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
46,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2010 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza is superb and shows great depth and nuance, with great freshness, and the red cherries are complemented by notes of blood oranges, nutmeg and other spices.

47,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,"The unique and personal 2009 Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva is a little darker than the 2008 I tasted next to it. It also feels a little riper and nuttier, with some traces of ripe apricots and flowers. It's also fuller and not as sharp as the 2008 and has a dry, chalky/stony palate. These are unique wines that develop in bottle for a long time. 14,200 bottles were filled in April 2015.",2009 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,RP 95
48,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"I had three vintages of the white Viña Gravonia to taste, which is exceptional because production has been really short these last few years, and they sell out very quickly. The oldest of the three is the 2009 Viña Gravonia Blanco, from a very old vineyard (91 years old), and it fermented in ancient oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in barrel for four years. 2009 was a warm and ripe vintage, and the wine has a fully developed nose, with notes of diesel, honey and beeswax, chamomile tea and pollen. But it's still fresh and has the chalky texture and austerity so characteristic of the Gravonia. 13,100 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2016.",2009 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 95
49,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,"I have had the chance drink a few bottles and taste (again) the 2008 Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva next to the current release, which is 2009, a good thing for comparison's sake. And I thought I should write a new note, because I find that the wine is developing beautifully, gaining in complexity; the salty/umami feeling seems to be increasing with the time in bottle. It feels fresher than the 2009, and the nose has more nuances, with some mineral, diesel-like notes, nuts, decayed flowers and hints of wet stones. A unique rosé.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Rosado Gran Reserva,RP 95
50,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Reserva,"Following the appreciation of the 2007 vintage from María José López de Heredia, the red 2007 Viña Tondonia Reserva is showing great, revealing unusual finesse and elegance. The nose is a little reticent but nuanced and complex, a little shy rather than explosive. The palate is medium-bodied, and the tannins are very refined. This has to be one of the finest vintages of Viña Tondonia Reserva of recent years. 200,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2015.",2007 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 96
51,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"They developed the superb 2007 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva following the founder of López de Heredia's admiration for the wines of Graves, austere and dry whites. 2007 was a very good vintage in Rioja, much better than anticipated, and the wines are evolving slowly and in a positive way. This is not an exception, and the wine is vibrant, lively and tasty, with a dry, umami/salty finish. María José López de Heredia considers 2007 a great vintage for their wines—extraordinary, with freshness and almost as good as 2010. There will be a Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva. 10,000 bottles produced.

52,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"2006 was a hard year to follow, even if 2007 was a great year in Rioja and exceptional for López de Heredia. The 2007 Viña Bosconia Reserva shows a little tannic, fulfilling the reputation for being a more rustic wine than Viña Tondonia. There are notes of chocolate-covered cherries and hints of forest floor. Maybe with a little more time in bottle? 70,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2014.",2007 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 96
53,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"One of two vintages I tasted of the white from the Viña Tondonia, the 2006 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva is from a warm and ripe year, but the wine doesn't show heat. It feels a little riper than the 2007 I tasted next to it. It has more depth and complexity than the Gravonia, with the aromatic profile closer to a white Hermitage than any other white I can think of. The palate is bone dry, with some austerity and pungent flavors, where the flavors include lemon peel, beeswax, herbal tea and dry hay. 10,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2015.",2006 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 96
54,R. Lopez de Heredia,Bodega Matador Parreno,"The otherworldly 2001 Bodega Matador Parreno is a very special wine from López de Heredia in Rioja. There are just ten barrels of this wine from the outstanding 2001 vintage in the region, mostly Tempranillo from their Viña Tondonia, but like all their reds, it also has small percentages of other red grapes and perhaps a touch of white too. Their Gran Reserva reds spend ten years in oak and a further ten years in bottle before they are released. For some reason, some ten barrels were left behind, and the wine aged in used oak barrels for much longer, which means the wine spent some five years in large oak vats and almost 11 more years in well-seasoned American oak barriques. By the time it was bottled, the power of the vintage had been tamed, and the wine had acquired incredible nuance and finesse as well as great complexity, while it still feels young and with potential to improve for a long time in bottle. It would be impossible to guess the age if tasted blind, as the wine feels much younger than what it is. The texture is velvety, with resolved tannins, great concentration, finesse and elegance, with incredible balance and an aftertaste full of exotic spices, orange peel, tobacco and ripe berry fruit. The flavors linger in your mouth forever after you swallow. 3,000 bottles were filled on December 14th, 2017 (I know the exact date because I happened to be in the winery on precisely that day!). Take this as a unique, one-off, super Gran Reserva from Viña Tondonia. While this is very drinkable now (I have consumed a good dozen bottles already), it has all that it takes for a long life in bottle: this should outlive most of us. Furthermore, this is considerably cheaper than the Gran Reserva, which will not be released until 2021 (and let's see what the price is then). It will make for a great comparison to have the two wines together in about three years from now. In the meantime, if I were you, I'd run to get as many bottles of it as you possibly can. To be fair, in fact, I already did!",2001 López de Heredia Bodega Matador Parreno,RP 96
55,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"The 2006 Viña Bosconia Reserva, always more rustic and powerful than the Viña Tondonia, was cropped from a warm and early harvest and is a blend of Tempranillo with 15% Garnacha and 5% Graciano and Mazuelo. This wine matures in used American oak barrels for five years. It has a very developed nose, and as winemaker Mercedes López de Heredia noted, ""It could be confused with a Gran Reserva, as I see it more tertiary and developed."" These are amazing wines, clean and complex, with polished tannins and surprisingly good acidity. I have the idea of 2006 as a warmer vintage, but it's not true throughout Rioja; as I've seen with other wines, like the ones from Muga, in this cooler part of Rioja, the vintage was much better. There are some dusty tannins and some flavors that still remind you of fresh fruit. 72,000 bottles were filled in June 2013.",2006 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 96
56,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The red they say was born to go with tapas and sold in local restaurants is the 2009 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza. 2009 was a warm and ripe year, and this blend of Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha (or the masculine Garnacho they like to use) plus 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo from limestone soils with quite a lot of clay, feels juicy and soft. It fermented with natural yeasts in large oak vats and matured in used barriques for three years. This is a bottling that has grown and improved a lot since 2004-2005. It shows very good balance between fruit and more developed aromas, with hints of leather and cherries, spices and smoke, very clean and with good volume in the palate. It's usually a little riper and with higher alcohol than Tondonia or Bosconia, with the character, finesse and elegance of a classical Reserva. 93,000 bottles produced.

57,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"The first white I tasted was the 2008 Viña Gravonia Blanco, a true bargain traditional oak-aged Rioja from very old Viura vines (90 years old!) on gravel soils. 2008 was a healthy vintage, which resulted in a slightly smaller crop than 2007, and the white grapes were picked starting on October 9th. They have never added yeasts to their wines, and this fermented in centenary oak vats and matured in used barriques for four years. It was bottled unfiltered. It has the right balance between youth and freshness and the more-developed aromas. The notes of dried flowers, honey, nuts and petrol are intermixed with aromas of quince, medlar and other yellow fruit, with hints of saffron and spices, quite developed. The palate is very tasty, and it ends with a salty finish. This is a cool vintage, where the wines show very good freshness. They do their blends to achieve a homogeneous style that shows the fresh and mineral character of the Gravonia vineyard. Year in, year out, this is one of the greatest bargains in Rioja and Spain. They produced some 17,800 bottles, which were filled in November 2013.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 96

It always matures in used American oak barriques for some six years. The oldest of all the reds I tasted, it was also the one with more freshness, which speaks to the quality of the vineyard. This takes the lion's share of the 400,000 bottles the winery produces, with some 220,000 bottles filled over a period of 12 consecutive days in May 2014.",2006 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 96
59,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"The 2005 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva is a fine and elegant wine inspired by the vineyards of Graves in Bordeaux. 2005 was an excellent vintage, when 154 hectares of vineyards from the 170 they own were in production. The grapes were picked before the rains of October 12th. This is mostly Viura (Macabeo), but it always contains some 10% Malvasía Riojana, and the white varieties are always planted on whiter, limestone-rich soils. It matured in used oak barriques for six years before bottling. María José and Mercedes López de Heredia told me their Viura, with the low yields they get (often 2,000 kilograms per hectare), shows less of the vintage differences, and even in torrid years like 2003, the wines do not show heat. It's very interesting comparing this with the Gravonia from 2008, as this showed higher ripeness and a lot more developed aromas, nuttier with hints of hay and straw, honey and also chamomile and dried flowers. But the oak is never obvious in the wine, it only adds spiciness but no wood aromas. 2005 was also a warmer, riper and more powerful vintage, which shows more in the palate, which is round and powerful with pungent flavors. 20,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in May 2013 over two consecutive days.",2005 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 96
60,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The first of the reds here is the 2008 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza from a cooler vintage that produced some austere and serious wines--a year with higher acidity and lively fruit. It feels effervescent and it makes you salivate. This is usually a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha, 5% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo from 50-year-old vines that ferments in ancient oak vats, and ages in barrel for three years. This cuvée has increased its quality tremendously since the 1990s. These cooler years provide citric freshness, and a very fine texture and vibrant acidity. This is so easy to drink that it can be dangerous.This was the Rioja clarete fino--the everyday red. It's both elegant and powerful. Very good value, too. 99,000 bottles produced.",2008 López de Heredia Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,RP 96

The nose is unique, showing aromas of chamomile, beeswax, honey, mushroom and spices, with reminiscences of a white Graves or an aged white Hermitage, quite developed, showing it all and ready. The palate shows great acidity with some oaky hints, with a chalky sensation, deep flavors with persistence and superb length. This has to be one of the greatest bargains in white Rioja. It feels lively, approachable, but with enough of everything to provide pleasure for a long time. There are 21,500 bottles of this wine.",2007 López de Heredia Viña Gravonia Blanco,RP 96
62,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Bosconia Reserva,"A worthy follow up to the 2004 is the 2005 Viña Bosconia Reserva, a wine that they consider the most rustic and powerful in the winery, but that I find as elegant and subtle as it gets. This feels very much in line with the 2004, maybe a notch above even, a lower yielding year. The nose is somehow closed and feels young with the elegant rusticity lurking from the bottom of the glass, clean and precise. The tannins are velvety and there is great acidity--a constant here. The wine is terribly elegant. I simply loved this wine. 99,000 bottles were filled in June 2011.",2005 López de Heredia Viña Bosconia Reserva,RP 96

The wine fermented in the original oak vats that are now some 140 years of age. There is no temperature control and malolactic was also in the vat. The wine was transferred to oak barrels where it slowly matured in their deep, humid caves for no less than six years. After this, it was bottled unfiltered after being fined with egg whites. I think the quality gap between the Reserva and Gran Reserva has been getting smaller since the 2001 vintage and this 2005 is nothing short of exceptional. It's clean and complex, with more freshness. The wine is very spicy and with a palate that feels very balanced, livelier than in the past. It has a long finish where the flavors are clean. Easy to drink and very pleasurable. Some 250,000 bottles were produced in 2005.",2005 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Reserva,RP 96

Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,"The 2004 Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva will be released sometime in 2017, and the difference with the Gravonia is 10% of very old Malvasía Riojana that provides a unique perfume and sophistication. It feels very young and primary, impossible to guess its age. The Viura is similar to the one from Gravonia, old and on clay and limestone soils; the white grapes always on whiter, stonier soils. Fermentation was carried out in their 140-year-old oak vats with natural yeasts (a constant here), where it goes through malolactic fermentation. The nose seems less developed than in the 2007 Gravonia, younger and livelier. Even after six years in oak, the wine is not oaky, but the aromas are subtle and even a little shy. The palate is austere and it feels a little stiff, with lively acidity and pungent flavors. This feels like a superb year for this bottling, it's clear that it's a great vintage. 35,000 bottles produced.",2004 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Reserva,RP 96
65,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2007 Viña Cubillo Crianza is the most affordable red.

It is a blend of the usual 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho, 5% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo fermented in old oak vats with natural yeasts and matured in barrel for three years. The intoxicating nose shows blood orange, bitter cherries, leather and spices in a subtle and balanced way.

The nose does not transmit any heat whatsoever, showing notes of chamomile, beeswax, honey and aromatic herbs. The palate is sharp, medium-bodied with great acidity and freshness that is both clean and persistent; it is more austere than exuberant, which was a real surprise. Overall, it is tasty and supple. The Gravonia vineyard is very old and naturally-balanced, which shows in the wine. Against all odds, the 2006 is showing better than the 2005 today.

It starts off slightly reduced, and needs time and air, so decanting in advance is not out of place. The palate is much more precise, pungent, intense, very balanced and persistent. The nose finally comes on its own with developed notes of petrol, beeswax and chamomile, perhaps a little more evolved than its siblings. This is a white full of personality, ready now.

It has the usual blend and usual levels of alcohol and acidity, bottled after six years in oak barrels. The nose feels savory (if that's possible–umami?) and developed, with tertiary aromas and good balance between spices, leathery notes, cherries and balsamic notes of cigar box and incense.

It is legally possible to have up to 15% of wine from a different vintage as the one shown on the label. She says their wines do not vary that much from vintage to vintage because of this. The house blend is around 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho (notice the masculine use of Garnacha), 5% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo fermented in old (up to 140 years old) oak vats with natural yeasts (""we have never added any yeasts"" was her answer). The wine has a canonical 12.5% alcohol and 6.5 grams of acidity. It matured in (used) barrels for six years and was bottled unfiltered. Even if they want to avoid the imprint from the vintage, it's impossible to erase the effect of the torrid 2003. The wine is less Tondonia than the 2004, and the fruit is more obvious and forward. The palate is fuller than your average vintage, juicy and ripe.

It was produced as always with 90% Viura and the rest Malvasía Riojana fermented in very old oak vats with natural yeasts and matured in well-seasoned oak barrels for six years. The white varieties are always planted in the stonier, whiter soils. There is an extra dimension of freshness in this 2001, with even some citric hints intermixed with yellow flowers and herbal tea notes. With time in the glass it keeps developing aromas and changing all the time; at one point it even smelled of ""turrón,"" the Spanish nougat produced with almonds and honey, perhaps bitter almonds. Hmmmm! This is approachable now and will keep in bottle. This is a great vintage for this wine.

Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"Still unreleased (the 1994 has just been launched and this will be sold in 2016), the 1996 Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva is a wine crafted to show the longevity of the wines produced with the grapes from the Tondonia vineyard in Haro. It follows the same path as the other Grandes Reservas, being a blend of grapes (mostly Viura and some 10% Malvasía Riojana) and up to 15% of wine from other vintages used to refill the barrels during the extended ten-year aging. This is more subtle, less expressive than the 1994, and is also lighter and in need of bottle age to develop more complexity. Still, I don't think it will get to the same level as the 1994. The 1996 harvest was a bit shorter, and 6,451 bottles were produced.",1996 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,RP 96
73,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"The only current red Gran Reserva is the 1995 Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva, the one that is produced exactly the same as before, including fining with egg whites and sealing with red wax. 1995 was an excellent and early harvest, the grapes achieved full ripeness and were harvested under the sun during two weeks starting October 9. The wine, which exceptionally achieved 13% alcohol, is the usual blend, 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho, 5% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo (Cariñena). Like all their wines, it fermented with indigenous yeasts in old oak vats and as a Gran Reserva it matured in old American oak barrels for ten years! Yes, it was bottled in November 2006 and launched in 2015, a full 20 years after the harvest. This light-colored, ethereal 1995 is the essence of Viña Tondonia. It has developed aromas and complexity gained with the time in bottle, of incense, leather, cured meat, cherries in liqueur, cold bonfire and spices. The palate is super-tasty, with fully-resolved tannins and very good acidity. The texture is super-fine, sophisticated and ethereal with gob-smacking balance. Intense, powerful and elegant, too. Hard to believe, but this red feels too young and while approachable, I'd wait a couple of years or more because it will be much better. The profile follows the style of the great classics of the 1950s and 60s. Bottles like this are the ones that created the López de Heredia myth. This could be lighter than the 1994, but in the long run I believe the 1995 will be the better bottle. 24,687 bottles produced.",1995 López de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,RP 96
74,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"Released even later than the red, the 1994 Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva, the most classical of all whites in existence in Spain, is a blend of 90% Viura and 10% Malvasía Riojana fermented in old (ancient!) oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in well-seasoned American oak barrels for ten years (yes, you read it correctly, ten years in barrique). It was bottled unfiltered in March 2005. This is by far the most complex white, with notes of curry and meat broth (think umami), that are complex, subtle and aromatic, plus show developing notes of mushrooms, autumn forest, aromatic herbs and hints of petrol and perhaps–and this might not be politically correct–traces of asparagus and mustard! The palate reveals a very compact wine, very intense, round but focused, with high-pitched flavors, great acidity and length. The wine is a chameleon, keeps changing in the glass, while the notes of green nuts, curry and morels made me think of a wine from the Jura. After drinking bottles from the 1940s, 50s and 60s, I can promise you this wine will outlive most of us, as the whites age even longer than the reds. 8,800 bottles exist.

75,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza,"The 2006 Vina Cubillo Tinto Crianza is a blend of 65% Tempranillo, 15% Garnacho (some wineries, like Lopez de Heredia, Muga or Telmo Rodriguez use the masculine name of Garnacha) and the rest Mazuelo and Graciano. It is aged for three years in used 225-liter American oak barrels (the only ones they use), racked twice per year, fined with egg whites and bottled unfiltered. It has a dark ruby color with an orange-brownish rim and a nose of red fruit, citric notes of candied orange skin and fresh blood orange, white pepper, balsamic herbs and some raw meat aromas. The palate is very polished, with balsamic flavors, sweet tannins and good acidity. A good traditional Rioja. Drink now-2021.  

Lopez de Heredia has a problem many wineries would like to have; they are selling their wines very fast, they don’t have enough stock to cover market demand and some of the wines are highly allocated. I’m not talking about their historical vintages here – which are also available on the price list –  I’m only talking about the current releases.  Everything is aggravated by the fact that some of the top wines are only produced in exceptional years: for example, the next Vina Tondonia Gran Reserva will be 1995 and won’t be released until 2015. For the white version of Tondonia Gran Reserva there is a gap between 1991, the last vintage sold, and 1996, the next one, so who knows when it will see the light! As a result, there are few wines to taste this year and we should be patient. All wines are produced from their own vineyards in Haro, each from a different plot that names the wine, produced and aged following the most orthodox traditional methods (visiting the winery is like time travelling to 100 years ago!) with no stainless steel or new oak to be found anywhere. In fact their vats and barriques are old, some of them very old. All their wines are aged for a long time before being released and keep their alcohol levels at around 12-12.5% with good acidity. They have tirelessly kept the traditional flame burning. At one point I heard Maria Jose Lopez de Heredia referring to them as “the last of the Mohicans.” That’s not the case anymore. The sad news is that Don Pedro Lopez de Heredia passed away in 2013. Born in 1928, he was the nephew of the Bodega’s founder and father of the current fourth generation in charge of the family winery, Maria Jose, Mercedes and Julio Cesar.

Lopez de Heredia,Viña Gravonia Blanco,"The 2004 Vina Gravonia Blanco is pure Viura from a vineyard named after the white wines from Graves in Bordeaux, which Don Rafael Lopez de Heredia y Landeta, founder of the winery, admired. It is aged for four years in used barrels, racked every six months and bottled after being fined with egg whites. 40,000 bottles were produced in the great 2004 vintage. It has a bright, shiny (almost fluorescent!) yellow color and a fresh nose of citric fruit (pink grapefruit), fennel, dried flowers, chamomile, beeswax and hints of mushrooms. The palate has superb acidity, which gives it incredible freshness with great delineation and purity of flavors finishing very dry with a mineral, almost saline note. It invites you to have  another bottle! This wine is labeled Crianza, but the aging times (and the quality) greatly exceed the requirements for the category. It’s sold almost a decade after the vintage year, so I still consider it a real bargain. Delicious now, but it should age with style. Drink new-2024.

Dark ruby-colored, with notes of beef blood, iron, antique shop, incense, blood orange and a touch of volatile acidity, the palate is very fresh, with good concentration, clear flavors and enough grip and fruit to age gracefully.

It is aged for six years in used barrels, racked twice per year during its upbringing and fined with egg whites before being bottled unfiltered. It has a slightly reduced nose that benefits from air contact, with shy aromas of cherries in liqueur, tea leaves, fine leather, game, blood, spice box and cigar ash, showing some evolution. The light to medium-bodied palate is balanced, with high acidity, but perhaps a little fragile, showing the difficulties of the vintage, as 2002 was a very difficult year in Rioja. 250,000 bottles were produced.

I have adored, indeed occasionally worshiped, the wines of Lopez de Heredia for many years, so I am not ashamed to admit that visiting both their vineyard and their winery was a pilgrimage. Founded by Rafael Lopez de Heredia y Landeta in 1877, it has withstood the tide of corporatization and homogeneity, and epitomizes timeless, artisan winemaking in their own individual, almost solipsistic manner. Technology is noticeable by its absence here. For example, to quote her sister Maria-Jose at a tasting that I subsequently attended in London: “Indigenous yeasts have adapted to high temperatures. To control the temperature during fermentation, we open doors and windows” and “malolactic is the invention of modern winemakers.” I had to check whether this was 2012 or 1912. If you were to award points for charisma, then this producer would be in a league of its own. That would count for nothing if their wines were not distinguished, individual, long-lived and above all, delicious. It is commonly known that if you are seeking bags of fruit and lashings of oak, this is not the place to come. My views and these scores might be irrational to someone with a penchant for lush, voluptuous Rioja. Lopez de Heredia is the apotheosis of traditional, classic wines: taut, fresh, bucolic, utterly charming and amazingly long-lived. I spent two or three hours with winemaker Mercedes Lopez de Heredia, who was celebrating her birthday with, appropriately enough, a bottle of Tondonia Gran Reserva from her year of birth. I urge readers to access the video I took of Mercedes explaining the vineyard in her own breathless style. In the meantime, I will crack on with the wines   “Wines should talk by themselves,” Maria-Jose enthused to her enraptured audience at a tasting in London. “My father was a vine maker, not a winemaker. Each wine is a reflection of a different land that my great-grandfather bought. Our wines respond to the history of Rioja.” I would add to her comments that since these are mainly aged wines, a bottle of Lopez de Heredia is an individual and each time you meet, you may see a different side to its personality. So treat these reviews as they are: snapshots at a given moment. We commence with their white wines and indeed, I know of several connoisseurs who rate these even better than their reds and I can sympathize with that view. “The white wines were made as a copy of Graves and were made to be aged,” Marie-Jose continued. “So they are made like reds and are harvested at the same time. They undergo skin contact for one, two or three days to absorb the preservative from the skins and pips. Viura gives complexity as it ages.”

I have adored, indeed occasionally worshiped, the wines of Lopez de Heredia for many years, so I am not ashamed to admit that visiting both their vineyard and their winery was a pilgrimage. Founded by Rafael Lopez de Heredia y Landeta in 1877, it has withstood the tide of corporatization and homogeneity, and epitomizes timeless, artisan winemaking in their own individual, almost solipsistic manner. Technology is noticeable by its absence here. For example, to quote her sister Maria-Jose at a tasting that I subsequently attended in London: “Indigenous yeasts have adapted to high temperatures. To control the temperature during fermentation, we open doors and windows” and “malolactic is the invention of modern winemakers.” I had to check whether this was 2012 or 1912. If you were to award points for charisma, then this producer would be in a league of its own. That would count for nothing if their wines were not distinguished, individual, long-lived and above all, delicious. It is commonly known that if you are seeking bags of fruit and lashings of oak, this is not the place to come. My views and these scores might be irrational to someone with a penchant for lush, voluptuous Rioja. Lopez de Heredia is the apotheosis of traditional, classic wines: taut, fresh, bucolic, utterly charming and amazingly long-lived.

95,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva,"The 1973 Vina Tondonia Blanco Gran Reserva is so sublime, so complete and natural that it may bring tears to the eyes. It has a complex bouquet of beeswax, lanolin, lemon curd and almond that is effortlessly combined. The palate is nigh-perfectly balanced with very good weight. It has a seamless waxy texture and a peacock’s tail of almond, creme brulee, marzipan and dried apricot. There is a beguiling sense of completeness here. Heaven in a glass, and one of the finest Tondonia Blancos I have encountered. Drink now-2020+  

I have adored, indeed occasionally worshiped, the wines of Lopez de Heredia for many years, so I am not ashamed to admit that visiting both their vineyard and their winery was a pilgrimage. Founded by Rafael Lopez de Heredia y Landeta in 1877, it has withstood the tide of corporatization and homogeneity, and epitomizes timeless, artisan winemaking in their own individual, almost solipsistic manner. Technology is noticeable by its absence here. For example, to quote her sister Maria-Jose at a tasting that I subsequently attended in London: “Indigenous yeasts have adapted to high temperatures. To control the temperature during fermentation, we open doors and windows” and “malolactic is the invention of modern winemakers.” I had to check whether this was 2012 or 1912. If you were to award points for charisma, then this producer would be in a league of its own. That would count for nothing if their wines were not distinguished, individual, long-lived and above all, delicious. It is commonly known that if you are seeking bags of fruit and lashings of oak, this is not the place to come. My views and these scores might be irrational to someone with a penchant for lush, voluptuous Rioja. Lopez de Heredia is the apotheosis of traditional, classic wines: taut, fresh, bucolic, utterly charming and amazingly long-lived. I spent two or three hours with winemaker Mercedes Lopez de Heredia, who was celebrating her birthday with, appropriately enough, a bottle of Tondonia Gran Reserva from her year of birth. I urge readers to access the video I took of Mercedes explaining the vineyard in her own breathless style. In the meantime, I will crack on with the wines   “Wines should talk by themselves,” Maria-Jose enthused to her enraptured audience at a tasting in London. “My father was a vine maker, not a winemaker. Each wine is a reflection of a different land that my great-grandfather bought. Our wines respond to the history of Rioja.” I would add to her comments that since these are mainly aged wines, a bottle of Lopez de Heredia is an individual and each time you meet, you may see a different side to its personality. So treat these reviews as they are: snapshots at a given moment. We commence with their white wines and indeed, I know of several connoisseurs who rate these even better than their reds and I can sympathize with that view. “The white wines were made as a copy of Graves and were made to be aged,” Marie-Jose continued. “So they are made like reds and are harvested at the same time. They undergo skin contact for one, two or three days to absorb the preservative from the skins and pips. Viura gives complexity as it ages.”

96,R. Lopez de Heredia,Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva,"The 1970 Vina Tondonia Gran Reserva has a wonderful bouquet that transports you directly to the vineyard: scents of gravel, wild mushroom, cherries and dusty attic. The palate is beautifully balanced with fine tannins and thrilling, almost rapier-like acidity. There are notes of decayed red berry fruit, sour lemon, rosemary and sage. The finish is rustic but so full of energy, with hints of orange peel on the finish. Wonderful. Drink now-2020+

The palate is seamless and weightless on the entry with perfect acidity and delicate “traces” of flavors such as tart cherry, cola and leather. It constitutes a textural Rioja rather than one that delivers flavors on a plate. This is sublime classic Rioja. Drink now-2020+.

A visit to the venerable Bodega Lopez de Heredia, located in the Rioja Alta capital of Haro, is akin to entering a time machine taking you back 100 years. Construction of the Bodega began in 1877 and continues without any apparent changes to the present day. The winery is operated by the voluble Maria Jose Lopez de Heredia, her sister Mercedes, and their father Pedro, still active into his 80s. All of the wines are produced from estate grown bush vines. Tondonia and Bosconia are two different vineyards; Bosconia has a larger percentage of Tempranillo and a different orientation.

This blend of 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay was disgorged in March 2022 with a dosage of five grams per liter.",2009 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon Rosé,RP 92
120,Dom Perignon,Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé,"A blend of 52% Pinot Noir, 27% Chardonnay and 21% Pinot Meunier, with 14% of red wine then added, the Moët & Chandon 2015 Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé is showing very well, evoking aromas of red berries, spring flowers, mandarin, cherries and pastry. Enveloping and full-bodied, it’s fruity and fresh, its gastronomic mid-palate segueing into a sappy finish.",2015 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé,RP 92
121,Dom Perignon,Extra Brut Grand Vintage,"A blend of 44% Pinot Noir, 32% Chardonnay and 24% Pinot Meunier, the Moët & Chandon 2015 Extra Brut Grand Vintage was bottled with a dosage of five grams per liter after six years in the cellars. With notes of marzipan, pastry, lemon confit, pear and peach, the bouquet is charming and fresh. Nervy tension animates its fine, crystalline palate. After some time in the glass, it evolves toward smoke, struck flint and vanilla notes. An elegant Champagne, now at its peak, but which could be kept for another five years.",2015 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage,RP 92
122,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"Disgorged in October 2022, the 2013 Dom Pérignon is a charming and elegant vintage for this cuvée. It reveals complex aromas of buttery pastry, spices, citrus oil, almonds, honey and, with aeration, a touch of smoke. The palate is medium to full-bodied, perfectly balanced, with a chiseled and tightly wound profile. The long, cool growing season has brought freshness and a delicate earthy note to the finish.",2013 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92

125,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"A charming, demonstrative vintage for this cuvée, the 2010 Dom Pérignon bursts with notes of mandarin, golden orchard fruit, toasted bread, almonds and petrol. Medium to full-bodied, rabid and ample, with a fleshy core of fruit and an open-knit, giving style, it has taken on a bit of texture since I last tasted it, but it remains fundamentally forward and immediate.",2010 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92

127,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P2,"The 2004 Dom Pérignon P2 is drinking beautifully on release, wafting from the glass with aromas of sweet orchard fruit, fresh peach, pastry cream, buttered toast and cotton candy that display a less reductive profile than the original disgorgement. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and charming, with an ample, enveloping core of fruit, succulent acids and a pretty pinpoint mousse, it concludes with a long, sapid finish. Forward and giving, there's no obvious reason to defer gratification.",2004 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P2,RP 92
128,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P2,"The 2003 Dom Pérignon P2 is rich and demonstrative, wafting from the glass with aromas of stone fruits, honeycomb and buttered toast that leave more space for the wine's generous fruit tones than the more overtly yeasty original disgorgement. Full-bodied, broad and textural, it remains very youthful despite its below-average acidity, with notable precision to its ripe fruit tones and chalky structuring extract that provides, to some extent, a compensating sensation of freshness; it's actually evolving more slowly than its 2002 counterpart. Given the wine's richness, it works best with food. Chaperon relates that then-Chef de Caves Richard Geoffroy rejected any musts with a pH exceeding 3.3, the only time this metric has been used as a basis for selection for Dom Pérignon, and that the juice was allowed to oxidize before vinification. I'm looking forward to seeing the 2003 in its P3 incarnation, as I suspect that the wine will really come into its own when it develops more tertiary notes.",2003 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P2,RP 92

Medium to full-bodied, chiseled and fine-boned, with an enveloping core of bright, vibrant fruit and a pretty pinpoint mousse, it concludes with a precise, penetrating finish. Incisive but not austere, it's an impressive effort, reflecting good levels of maturity in this cool, late harvest. It's as fine a rendition of this cuvée as I can remember tasting.",2013 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage,RP 92

131,Dom Perignon,Brut Imperial,"Based on the challenging 2017 vintage, the current release of Moët & Chandon's NV Brut Imperial was disgorged with seven grams dosage (representing a reduction of around 50% in the last 20 years) and contains an unusually high proportion of reserve wines. Offering up aromas of pear, peach and citrus oil mingled with hints of fresh bread and white flowers, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and pillowy, with racy acids and an enveloping core of fruit, complemented by a pinpoint mousse and concluding with a nicely defined finish.

132,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"Aromas of fresh brioche, green pear, waxy citrus rind, iodine and subtly autolytic top notes mingle in an inviting bouquet, introducing the 2009 Dom Pérignon. It's a medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy wine that's rich and textural, with good concentration and lively acids despite being the ripest rendition in the history of this cuvée. As I wrote earlier this year, while the wine is open and enveloping, there's also enough energy and structure here to promise good mid-term aging potential, something that becomes more apparent as the wine loses a little puppy fat.",2009 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
133,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon Rosé,"The 2006 Dom Pérignon Rosé continues to show very well, unfurling in the glass with aromas of bitter orange, dried white flowers, red berries, toast and woodsmoke. On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and muscular, with all the phenolic structure and depth that one would expect from a rosé that contains more than 20% still red wine, concluding with a sapid and chalky finish.

Broad, textural and delicately phenolic, it's a successful effort in a challenging Champagne vintage.",2005 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon Rosé,RP 92
135,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"The 2004 Dom Pérignon is one of the more reductive, autolytic vintages of this wine to have been released in the last decade, offering up a toasty bouquet of pears, green apple, iodine, peach and smoke. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny textured and fleshy, with a sweet core of fruit, a fine mousse and a vinous profile. The 2004 is drinking well today: as I wrote earlier this year, between the rich, ripe 2002 and the powerful but racy 2008, the 2004 is an excellent but more classically proportioned example of Dom Pérignon.",2004 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
136,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P2,"The 2002 Dom Pérignon P2 is showing very well indeed, wafting from the glass with aromas of crisp yellow orchard fruit, dried white flowers, orange oil, smoky peach, peat and praline. On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and textural, with a ripe and muscular core of fruit, ripe acids and fine concentration, concluding with a long and elegantly toasty finish. As I wrote earlier this year, this is a ripe and powerful Dom Pérignon that finds its closest stylistic analogy in the 1990 vintage, and it is considerably less evolved than the more tertiary 2000 P2 today. While the P2 is a bit drier and more precise on the finish than the original release, given the wine's slow evolution, the difference between the two is less pronounced than it has been for any vintage since 1996. To my palate, it really needs four or five years in the cellar before it truly starts to blossom.",2002 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P2,RP 92
137,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P2,"The 2000 Dom Pérignon P2 opens in the glass with aromas of waxy citrus oil, warm bread, dried fruits, fresh peach and iodine. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, with a sweet core of mature fruit, ripe acids and a sapid, elegantly toasty finish. As I wrote earlier this year, the 2000 vintage delivered a precocious Dom Pérignon, and this recently disgorged rendition has really benefited from the additional time sur lattes, acquiring notably more complexity—while retaining more energy—than the original disgorgement.",2000 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P2,RP 92
138,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon Rosé P2,"The 1996 Dom Pérignon Rosé P2 is showing beautifully, wafting from the glass that mingles aromas of dried fruits, raspberries and toasted bread with nuances of rose hips, peonies, smoke and spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and complete, with a beautifully integrated spine of acidity, excellent concentration and a vinous profile, concluding with a long and iodine-inflected finish. There's a touch more breadth and dimension here than in the white Dom Pérignon P2 of the same vintage, but the two wines share a strong vintage signature this year.",1996 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon Rosé P2,RP 92
139,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P2,"Wafting from the glass with notes of pear, citrus oil, wheat toast, iodine, smoke and dried white flowers, the 1996 Dom Pérignon P2 is medium to full-bodied, layered and incisive, with a chalky, tight-knit core, excellent concentration and racy acids, concluding with a long, sapid finish. The 1996 is still quite reserved, but in all its various incarnations—from the original release, the Oenothèque and the P2—it has been consistently superb. Readers with bottles in their cellars need be in no hurry to pop corks, as the wine still has a long future ahead of it.",1996 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P2,RP 92
140,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P3,"While the original disgorgement of this wine is beginning to get a little long in the tooth in regular formats from all but the coolest cellar, the 1990 Dom Pérignon P3 is showing superbly, bursting from the glass with a thrilling bouquet of ripe yellow fruits, dried white flowers, honeycomb, brioche and and spruce smoke. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny textured and deep at the core, with terrific concentration, ripe acids and structuring dry extract, concluding with a long, beautifully defined finish. The 1990 is clearly a vintage that has been favored by the combination of additional time on the lees and lower dosage, and in its P3 incarnation, it can go head to head with the 1985, even if the latter vintage is aging more gracefully from the original release. Given that the 1990 P3 is an expressive, dramatic wine, there seems little reason to wait, though it ought to perform at this level for the better part of a decade.",1990 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P3,RP 92
141,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"Drunk from a pristinely preserved original disgorgement, the 1985 Dom Pérignon is inviting and exuberant, bursting with aromas of apples, pears, buttered toast, orange oil, tarte tatin and smoke. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and pillowy, with a generous core of fruit, ripe but racy acids and a refined mousse. This bottle ranked a step behind a sublime magnum of this cuvée's P3 rendition that I enjoyed earlier in the year, but it was nonetheless an exquisite Champagne. In both cases, the 1985 is in its prime, so now is a great time to open bottles.",1985 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
142,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"From an impeccably conserved original disgorgement, the 1976 Dom Pérignon is showing brilliantly, offering up aromas of praline, confit citrus, toasted bread, beeswax and subtle hints of mocha. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and vinous, with fine depth at the core, lively acids and a long, sapid finish, complemented by a healthy but ultra-fine mousse.  The product of a dry, compressed growing season, the harvest for Dom Pérignon began on September 1.",1976 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
143,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"This perfectly conserved bottle of the 1966 Dom Pérignon showed some wispy carbon dioxide on opening, which is always a positive sign, and revealed a rich and tertiary bouquet of dried fruits, mocha, toasted nuts and saffron. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with considerable muscle and concentration, a vestigial mousse and a bright spine of structuring acidity. Though this original disgorgement is tiring, there's still no fraying on the finish. While in 750-milliliter bottles, the 1966 Dom Pérignon seems to be in gentle decline, at least based on the last few bottles I have encountered, magnums—or anything stored in a glacial cellar—might still be very interesting indeed.",1966 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
144,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"It isn't easy to find pristine examples of the 1961 Dom Pérignon from the original disgorgment, and many bottles are getting a little long in the tooth, but this has the potential to be an absolutely magical old Champagne. Soaring from the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of toasted nuts, honeycomb, dried fruits, ripe peach and mocha, this bottle—from a cold French cellar—was full-bodied, textural and enveloping, with superb depth at the core, racy acids and chalky back-end grip on the long, resonant finish. The 1961 Dom Pérignon ranks as one of René Philipponnat's greatest hits during his time as Moët's chef des caves.",1961 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
145,Dom Perignon,Extra Brut Grand Vintage,"Disgorged in February 2018 with five grams per liter dosage, Moët's 2012 Extra Brut Grand Vintage is showing well, unfurling in the glass with an expressive bouquet of ripe yellow orchard fruit, peaches, toasted nuts, warm bread and honeycomb. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with a tangy but ripe core of fruit, nicely integrated acids and a pinpoint mousse, concluding with an attractively fruit-driven finish. The 2012 reflects both the concentration of the vintage and Moët's push for riper fruit, and it is already quite accessible.",2012 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage,RP 92
146,Dom Perignon,Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé,"Disgorged in February 2018 with five grams per liter dosage, the 2012 Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé bursts with expressive aromas of cherries, red berries, peaches and marzipan. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a similarly broad and fleshy profile to its white counterpart, but with more phenolic structure from the 13% still Pinot Noir in the blend, which lends it a seemingly drier, chalkier finish even though the two cuvées saw the same dosage. The more-concentrated regular Extra Brut has the edge over the Rosé, but this is a creditable effort.",2012 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage Rosé,RP 92
147,Dom Perignon,Extra Brut Grand Vintage Collection,"Disgorged in May 2017, the 2002 Extra Brut Grand Vintage Collection has acquired appreciable complexity from its 15 years sur lattes, offering up aromas of honeyed citrus fruit that mingle with nuances of smoke, iodine and brown butter. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and impressively vinous, with a textural attack, good depth at the core and a pinpoint mousse, concluding with a sapid, saline finish. It should drink well for another decade.",2002 Moët & Chandon Extra Brut Grand Vintage Collection,RP 92
148,Dom Perignon,Brut Impérial Rosé,"The latest release of the NV Brut Impérial Rosé offers up a pretty bouquet of candied strawberries and red berries, followed by a medium-bodied, delicately fleshy, open-knit palate that's nicely balanced, albeit somewhat ephemeral. Considering the volume produced, it's a creditable effort, and it's worth noting that the wine's dosage is well integrated.",NV Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial Rosé,RP 92
149,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"The 2003 Dom Pérignon is maturing very gracefully in bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of smoke, bread dough, waxy lemon rind and confit citrus. On the palate, the wine is ample, vinous and full-bodied but retains excellent definition, and it's structured around chewy dry extract from mature skins, which compensates for its comparative lack of acidity. It will be interesting to follow its evolution over the coming decade.",2003 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
150,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon Rosé P2,"The 2000 Dom Pérignon Rosé P2 is a sapid, gastronomic wine, unfurling in the glass with attractive aromas of iodine, blood orange, dried white flowers and oyster shell. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and elegantly textural, with a rich and open-knit core of distinctly savory fruit, a fine but youthfully boisterous mousse and a long, saline finish. This almost Burgundian-styled rosé is fully mature and drinking very well today, and I would be inclined to open bottles over the coming decade.",2000 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon Rosé P2,RP 92
151,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon P3,"The 1985 Dom Pérignon P3 is showing brilliantly from magnum, offering up a deep and complex nose of waxy lemon rind, oyster shell, mandarin, iodine and smoky autolysis. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a fine but ebullient mousse, exceptional concentration and intensity, brisk acids and a long, expansive finish. This disgorgement is beautifully timed, capturing the wine in a phase of controlled opulence, and it is drinking beautifully today.",1985 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon P3,RP 92
152,Dom Perignon,P2,"The Dom Pérignon 1998 P2 offers an intense yet fine and nutty bouquet with licorice notes and a lovely mineral freshness. Intense and fruity on the palate, this is a round, charming, very fresh yet somewhat loud and unrefined 1998 with a long, aromatic finish. The bubbles could be finer, especially given the long aging on the lees. I had a much better sample at the domaine in early spring 2016. Tasted October 2018.",1998 Moët & Chandon P2,RP 92
153,Dom Perignon,Grand Vintage Rosé,"Moët & Chandon's intensely colored 2008 Grand Vintage Rosé is dominated by Pinot Noir (50% or more along with roughly 30% Chardonnay and 20% Meunier) and contains 20% of red wine. It is released earlier than the white counterpart, which is scheduled for the second half of 2016 due to its strong acidity, which chef de cave Benoît Gouez finds ""a bit too prominent,"" though ""not as crazy as the 1996 acidity."" The color of the 2008 GV Rosé is that of a candied cherry and indicates a nice maturity. Fresh, red fruit aromas on the nose lead to a dry and complex palate cleanser with discreet vegetal aromas.

154,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"The 2006 Dom Pérignon comes from a very rich vintage with an early ripeness that brought a lot of aromatic maturity. The white-golden prestige cuvée contains a bit more Chardonnay than Pinot Noir and opens with a deep and seductive, pretty accessible nose with intense yet fresh fruit aromas of pineapples, with peaches and tangerines. Lively and elegant on the palate, this is a full-bodied, unusually aromatic and fruity DP with a long and tension-filled expression.  ",2006 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
155,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"The 2005 Dom Pérignon has a brilliant white-golden color and is intense on the yeasty nose, where vegetal aromas along with almond and rather discreet fruit flavors are displayed, before they intensify and become more rich. Firm, fresh and elegant, this is a full-bodied, complex and pretty rich, well concentrated and creamy-textured DP with a tightly woven structure; it has a still somewhat edgy finish. There is bit more Pinot Noir than usual in this blend, whereas the produced quantity is relatively low. Due to strict selections, just the half of the normal quantity was produced.

156,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon Rosé,"The fascinatingly copper-colored 2004 Dom Pérignon Rosé has a beautifully delicate bouquet of red fruits,and indicates a great purity and freshness. Kept on the lees for at least nine years to smooth the tannins the 2004 reveals a weightless power on the palate. It has a deep and concentrated, highly elegant Pinot character (though Chardonnay and Pinot are more or less 50/50), and is full of finesse and freshness. The 2004 is intense and vinous, yet pure, precise and extremely fine. Adorable.",2004 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon Rosé,RP 92
157,Dom Perignon,Dom Pérignon,"The 2004 Dom Pérignon is from a classic vintage and a very generous year in terms of yields. White-golden in color, the clear, discreet and subtle nose gives way to dried white rather than yellow fruits, raisins and hazelnuts, as well as to floral and herbal aromas. Less generous and concentrated in the mouth than the 2005 and austerely dry at the moment, the 2004 shows its great finesse and characteristic minerality. There should be a better point of time to praise its class, so trust and keep it!",2004 Moët & Chandon Dom Pérignon,RP 92
158,Dom Perignon,MCIII 001.14,"As MC-owned Dom Pérignon sails under its own flag, the NV MCIII is the new prestige cuvée of Moët & Chandon, and it is nothing but a unique assemblage of different vintages or what MC calls ""the Champagne of the third millennium."" With its ambitious MCIII, Moët seeks the perfect ""balance between harmony and generous complexity"" by blending young vintages aged in stainless steel vats (I), with matured vintages aged in oak casks (II), and rare vintages aged in glass bottles (III). Call it madness or the ""icon of luxury for a new generation,"" but this is of what the inaugural assemblage NV MCIII 001.14 is made: steel-fermented vins clairs of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from the vintage 2003, which were blended together in 2004 and comprise 40% of the cuvée (I); another 40% blends the declared vintages 2002, 2000 and 1998 that were mainly fermented in large oak vats and kept as vins clairs for Moët's Grand Vintage (II); and the final 20% assembles the Grand Vintage Collection Champagnes 1999, 1998 and 1993, which had already undergone the second fermentation, but had not been disgorged yet (III). The ""ultimate expression of blending"" was created in 2004 and kept for ten years on the lees of the second (respectively third) fermentation. The cuvée 001.14 was disgorged in 2014 as Brut with a dosage of four or five grams per liter. The expensive wine offers a fascinatingly deep and concentrated bouquet that is very clear and fresh in its fruit aromas, but also delivers complex secondary aromas of coffee, nougat, biscuits and many more flavors. Full-bodied, ripe and intense on the palate, this is a rich and powerful, yet round and highly elegant cuvée of great complexity and persistence. It is stunningly fresh and pairs fruity aromas with nutty and spicy flavors, revealing a delicate tannin structure and a very long, salty and mineral finish.

Full-bodied, rich, intense and powerful on the palate, with a good concentration, licorice flavors, a firmly structured elegance and persistent finish, this is a remarkably pure though complex Rosé Champagne.

This Champagne is full-bodied, intense and powerful, yet really fine and refreshing on the palate; it has nutty flavors and a lot of tension and chalky flavors.

Full-bodied and very well structured, this is a very rich, round, intense and powerful Champagne with good tension and persistence in the finish.

In its eighth year of bottle maturation, this cuvée displays a beautifully clear, intense and matured bouquet with cashew nut flavors, along with dried and ultra-ripe white fruit aromas and some tangy notes. Full-bodied, vital and with minty flavors (After Eight mint chocolate thins) on the palate, this is complex and elegant Champagne with great intensity, fine tannins and a stunning vitality. Great expression. Should be outstanding with food.",1999 Moët & Chandon Grand Vintage Collection Brut,RP 92
163,Dom Perignon,Impérial Brut,"Moët's white golden NV Impérial Brut is an assemblage of equal parts of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier (30% to 40% of each) and a smaller proportion of Chardonnay. Bright and fresh fruit aromas of yellow apples, ripe pears and lemons, along with floral flavors and a hint of stones and almond croissant lead to a medium-bodied, elegant, pretty intense and well structured palate; it has nice freshness and generous fruit. The finish reveals a stimulating grip and a moderate sweetness (dosage is nine grams per liter). Very good and less sweet than in former years. (Lot LAI2C)",NV Moët & Chandon Impérial Brut,RP 92
164,Dom Perignon,Grand Vintage,"Assembled from surprisingly close to one-third each of Champagne’s trio of major cepages, Moet & Chandon’s 2004 Brut Grand Vintage delivers a delightful aroma mingling chamomile and honeysuckle, pear and white peach, green tea and quinine, all anticipating the lusciously juicy, refreshingly tart and subtly piquant but also silken and buoyant palate impression that follows. As with the corresponding rose, I was surprised to find a decided sense of sweetness from just five grams residual sugar, but the ripe generosity of the vintage no doubt goes far toward explaining this, and I don’t find it at all misplaced, much less obtrusive. Its soothing texture complements this wine’s invigorating vivacity, levity, and transparence to herbal and floral nuances in a lingering finish. I would not be surprised to witness it offering some additional – or at least, new – delights over the next couple of years in bottle.

A nose of fresh red raspberry and fennel leads to a sappy, snappy, marzipan-tinged palate impression whose supportive sweetness led me to imagine a higher dosage than the mere five grams that are present; but then, this wine’s luscious sense of vivid and ripe red fruit fits the generous and warm nature of its vintage. While not especially complex – though perhaps a year or two more in bottle will lend depth – this is nonetheless impeccably balanced and irresistibly appetizing.

166,Dom Perignon,Dom Perignon Rose,"What’s more, the price-quality rapport here is excellent by any Champagne standards, and puts that of many a prestige cuvee to shame. Moet’s 2003 Brut Rose Dom Perignon exhibits both richness and robustness reflecting its torrid vintage, yet manages to stint neither on primary juiciness nor transparency to nuance; nor does it come off as at all heavy. Lightly cooked ripe strawberry and fig infused with rose hip, licorice, Ceylon tea, heliotrope and leather inform a delightfully forward nose and lush, effusively fruity palate. A tart and seedy edge to the strawberry serves for invigoration; and lobster shell reduction serves for mouthwatering salinity and somehow downright sweet animal savor. There is a hint of tannin, but it is fine-grained and suggestive of structural support. A long, seductively rich finish manages to harbor not just the immediately aforementioned virtues, but also a sense of transparency to floral and tea-like nuances and to virtually shimmering stoniness. This alluring and distinctive beauty should be worth following for at least the next half dozen years.

167,Dom Perignon,Brut Champagne,"The 2004 Brut Grand Vintage bursts from the glass with layers of rich, tropical fruit. A big, boisterous wine, the 2004 is not shy, that’s for sure. Expressive yellow fleshed fruits, smoke, spices and pastry are some of the many nuances that take shape in this broad-shouldered wine. The 2004 settles down a bit with air, but never loses its essentially extroverted, flashy personality. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2019.

The 2002 Brut Rose explodes from the glass with endless layers of huge, voluptuous fruit, A big, full-bodied wine, the 2002 is probably the most overly vinous, intense Rose ever made by long-time Chef de Caves Richard Geoffroy. Layers of cool, insistent minerality balance the fruit beautifully on the crystalline, vivid finish. The 2002 will be nearly impossible to resist young, but take my word for it; the wine is extremely closed right now. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2032.

It possesses fabulous depth and richness, with layers of expressive fruit and terrific overall balance. Dried flowers, spices, licorice and herbs wrap around the finish. The 2002 doesn’t quite have the freshness of most wines of this vintage, so it is best enjoyed sooner rather than later. This is Lot # LAGM5 AD AY. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.

171,Dom Perignon,Dom Perignon,"The 2002 Dom Perignon is at first intensely floral, with perfumed jasmine that dominates the bouquet. With time in the glass the wine gains richness as the flavors turn decidedly riper and almost tropical. Apricots, passion fruit and peaches emerge from this flashy, opulent Dom Perignon. The wine’s volume makes it approachable today, but readers in search of more complexity will want to cellar this for at least a few years to allow for some of the baby fat to drop off. Geoffroy describes the vintage as very ripe and adds that some of the Chardonnay showed the ill-effects of the hot growing season in the somewhat burned, dehydrated fruit that came in that year. This bottle was disgorged in July, 2009. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2032.  

Four new releases of the flagship Dom Perignon are the highlights among these Champagnes from Moet & Chandon. There is a timeless elegance about Dom Perignon that I find comforting and reassuring, like a favorite restaurant or food. For that reason, nothing could have prepared me for the Champagnes I tasted recently with Chef de Caves Richard Geoffroy. While the 2002 Dom Perignon and 1996 Dom Perignon OEenotheque are both for the most part representative of what readers have come to expect from this house, the 2000 Dom Perignon Rose and 1990 Dom Perignon Rose OEenotheque are wines that push the envelope and push it hard. I can’t think of another winemaker at a Grande Marque who is willing to take these kinds of risks by turning well-established conventions on their head. Much of what I tasted reminded me of the experimental, searching spirit that defines so many of the smaller-production, artisan Champagnes being made today. As the saying goes ‘no guts no glory’ and there is plenty of both here. These wines are nothing short of magnificent.

172,Dom Perignon,Dom Perignon Rose,"The 2000 Dom Perignon Rose is a flashy, ripe Champagne that screams Pinot to a degree I have never encountered in another vintage of this wine. A dark, intense color leads to a Chambolle-like nose followed by endless red berries, flowers and spices, all backed up with plenty of muscle, richness and density. The wine continues to blossom on the palate, with utterly beguiling detail, clarity and polish, all qualities that resonate on the rich, expansive finish. The 2000 Dom Perignon Rose is 45% Chardonnay and 55% Pinot Noir, of which 25% is still Pinot. Geoffroy says his goal was to make a statement with the 2000 Dom Perignon Rose; he has done that?and so much more. In fact, the 2000 seems to signal a stylistic shift towards a more important, serious style of rose. This superb wine is not to be missed, but readers should note this is no easygoing rose, rather it is a Champagne that demands serious attention. The 2000 will test the limits of what readers expect from a Dom Perignon Rose, but the wine is simply marvelous. I loved it. This bottle was disgorged in 2008. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

At first deceptively understated, the wine turns positively explosive and layered on the palate, showing remarkable tension, elegance and power, all wrapped around a seriously intense frame. The balance between fruit and acidity is awesome. This is a marvelous DP OEeno. The OEeno is the same juice as the regular Dom Perignon, except the OEeno is aged on the cork while the regular DP is aged in crown-sealed bottles. Once disgorged, the OEenos gets a slightly lower dosage than is typical for the original release DP. This bottle was disgorged in 2008. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2026.

174,Dom Perignon,Dom Perignon Rose Oenotheque,"The 1990 is the first Dom Perignon Rose to be released as part of the OEenotheque program and is also the year Richard Geoffroy was appointed to his post as Chef de Caves. This is a hypnotic, mesmerizing wine that is unlike any Champagne I have ever tasted. A burnished, deep orange, the wine emerges from the glass with delicate layers of truffles, mushrooms, tea and autumn leaves that recall a great, mature Grand Cru red Burgundy. Candied orange peel, dried roses, spices, apricot jam and white pepper are some of the notes that develop with air. Despite its vivid, textured personality the wine hovers on the palate in a weightless, ethereal style. Geoffroy served the 1990 Rose OEenotheque in the new Riedel Burgundy glass, which worked beautifully, although this drinking experience may not be for everybody. With air, the 1990 Rose OEenotheque naturally loses much of its effervescence and turns more wine-like. Though undeniably beautiful, this is a highly quirky wine that should only be purchased by readers familiar with aged rose Champagne or those with an open mind, because it will challenge many preconceptions of what Champagne is and can be. At an estimated $900 a bottle, it won’t come cheaply, either. That said, it is marvelous and totally compelling. The 1990 Rose OEenotheque is 50% Chardonnay, 50% Pinot Noir, of which 20% is still Pinot. Geoffroy has plans to release a number of older roses, including the very rare 1966 sometime next year. The 1990 Rose OEenotheque is already rather forward, and I am not sure how it will age from here. I also have a personal preference for drinking roses a touch on the younger side, which readers should take into consideration when looking at my drinking window. The 1990 Rose OEenotheque spent ten years longer on its lees than the original release and received lower dosage. This bottle was disgorged in 2007. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2015.

Moet & Chandon is one of Champagne’s giants when it comes to the sheer number of bottles that emerge from its cellars each year. The house’s top wine, Dom Perignon, is quite possibly the most iconic wine in Champagne, and perhaps the world. Production numbers are always kept close to the vest, but that notwithstanding, it is impossible to ignore the exceptional quality that the best vintages offer. At its best Dom Perignon is also an extremely ageworthy wine. In recent years Chef de Caves Richard Geoffroy has instituted a program of re-releasing newly disgorged wines under the OEnotheque program. Younger vintages see a second release (also known as second plenitude), while some of the older, classic vintages from the 1970s are on their third release (also known as third plenitude). While the OEnotheques, particularly the third releases, can be very pricey, at their finest they offer an extraordinary,otherworldly drinking experience matched by few wines in the world. Although Moet & Chandon doesn't disclose disgorgement dates, Geoffroy is considering adding that information in the near future.

The crisp, subtle, wheat thin, and honeyed apple-scented nose is followed by a medium-bodied wine with persistent, tiny, uniform bubbles, wonderful richness, enough acidity to balance the wine's weight, and a long, dry finish.  A superlative example of an elegantly-styled Champagne, the 1985 is more backward than the 1982; it should age well for 15 years. 

Dom Perignon is a high profile wine and in numerous vintages it is one of the greatest Champagnes produced.  Moreover, its gorgeous, precocious taste belies its amazing aging potential in certain vintages.  Recent tastings of the 1947, 1964, 1969, and 1971 provide persuasive evidence that some vintages of Dom Perignon can last for decades without deteriorating.

Perhaps it's just shut down?",2015 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,RP 93
201,Francois Lamarche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is one of the more promising longer-term propositions in the range at this address, its bouquet of cocoa, plum, spice and game bird introducing a wine with good mid-palate concentration, sappy acids, and fine-boned structure.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 93
202,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2015 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru offers up a reticent nose of red fruit and licorice. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with delicate—borderline fleeting—fruit and fine-grained but firm tannins. If this gains depth and dimension as it ages it could confound my modest score, but for now my preference is for the Echezeaux.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 93
203,Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras is more high-toned than the Malconsorts, with notes of red berries and flowers, more concentrated on the palate but also firmer and more angular, with bright acids and taut, chalky tannins.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 93
204,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau,"The 2015 Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau reveals a sweet bouquet of cherries, dried currants, cocoa nib and earth, followed by a medium to full-bodied, glossy palate with sappy acids and chalky tannins that make themselves felt on the finish. This is a touch deeper and more compelling than the Suchots and Chaumes.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau,RP 93
205,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes is, in turn, a little deeper and more concentrated than the Vosne-Romanée Village, wafting from the glass with notes of cherry, raspberry and plum; the prelude to a medium-bodied palate framed by fine-grained, rather dry tannins: delicate and rather diffuse.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,RP 93
206,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots,"The 2015 Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots offers up aromas of plums, cassis and spice, followed by a medium-bodied, rather inscrutable palate without any real discernible concentration or depth.

207,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee Village,"The 2015 Vosne Romanee Village offers up a note of ripe cherry, cedary wood, orange rind and spice, with more depth than the Haut Côtes de Nuits.

209,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has a more substantial bouquet than the Les Suchots this year, a mixture of black and red fruit (blackberry, crushed strawberry, briary, subtle autumn leafy scents percolating through with time). Like the other cuvées, there is very fine delineation here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine definition. This feels lithe and harmonious in the mouth, hints of tobacco and smoke filtering through the dark berry fruit and seguing into a spicy finish that leaves the mouth tingling for 45 to 60 second afterward. Excellent.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,RP 93
210,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Nicole told me she lost between 20% and 25% of the crop of her 2016 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru this year. This is evident on the nose that has more fruit intensity and joie de vivre than the Echézeaux. It springs forth with Morello cherries, crushed strawberry and minerals, beautifully defined and focused. The palate is very well balanced with supple tannin, impressive depth (obviously not carried by any new oak) with a gentle but insistent grip toward the finish. I love the arching structure of this Grands Echézeaux carried mostly by the fruit tannin, plus the persistence on the finish. Superb.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 93

It is certainly cut from a different cloth to the regular La Grande Rue. The palate has maybe finer, tauter tannin than the regular cuvée, very tensile in the mouth with a little more sappiness toward the finish. I wager it is not intrinsically superior to the La Grande Rue, just different.","2016 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue ""Cuvee 1959"" Grand Cru",RP 93
212,Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"The 2016 La Grande Rue Grand Cru was not affected by the frost, thankfully. This is (again) attested by the aromatics that convey a sense of joie de vivre and energy. Does that come from the relief of being spared? It offers wonderful red cherries, blood orange and yuzu scents combing with minerals. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin, impressive depth and grip in the mouth. Maybe this year it does not quite convey the same aristocratic personality as the Grands Echézeaux but there is real muscle and depth on the finish. Give this four or five years in barrel at least.",2016 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 93
213,Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"There are just one and half barrels of the 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras this year instead of the of the four or five normally produced. It has a gentle bouquet with red cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, just a faint suggestion of menthol bubbling away under the surface. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin that frames the Aux Cras with commendable substance given the impact of the frost. This does not feel as if it lost any energy during the trauma of the early growing season and it has a lovely saline finish. Excellent. Just a shame there is so little!",2016 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 93
214,Francois Lamarche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"From 1.35 hectares of vines in the upper sector of Clos Vougeot (in the lieu-dit Montiotes Hautes), Nicole managed to eke out just 12 barrels to make her 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru. It has a pleasant bouquet with attractive woodland/undergrowth scents complementing the light red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin, well balanced and perhaps demonstrating more substance than the Echézeaux that was equally impacted by the frost. I appreciate here the touch of white pepper lingering on the aftertaste. Fine.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 93
215,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes captures the florality of the appellation with bunches of rose petals, a hint of peony that complements the red berry fruit (Morello and raspberry preserve). The palate is medium-bodied with fine, slightly crunchy tannin. I love the purity here, the energy contained within, precise and focused with a little more spiciness on the finish compared to the village cru. As it aerates I noticed darker fruit emerging plus a slight chalkiness to the tannin. Excellent—this may actually surpass the 2015 Chaumes.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,RP 93
216,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau,"The 2016 Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau was less affected by the frost due to its proximity to the village. It has an attractive, peppermint-tinged bouquet that unfolds in the glass, not powerful or showy, just crisp and precise. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin, a crisp line of acidity, gentle and caressing in texture with a silky smooth finish. What this might lack in depth is compensated for in pure unadulterated pinoté.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau,RP 93
217,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots,"Nicole told me that she lost 80% of the crop, which means there are only four barrels of the 2016 Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots this year. It has an agreeable, clean and pure nose with red cherries, blueberry and a touch of orange peel, although like many Suchots this vintage, it feels denuded the opulence and flamboyance a great Suchots brings to the table. The palate is nevertheless well balanced with fine tannin, much more linear and direct than the 2015, with dark berry fruit laced with tobacco toward the finish. Fine, but I might actually prefer the Vosne-Romanée Chaumes this year.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots,RP 93
218,Francois Lamarche,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Echezeaux Grand Cru was diminished to just 40% of the usual production due to frost. Nicole suggested that the humidity may not have helped. As such, I did feel that this cuvée did not quite convey the same energy as say, Lamarche's Malconsorts or Croix Rameau, as if the terroir had lost its tongue. The palate is still nicely balanced with firm tannin, but it feels a little monotone compared to other cuvées, very conservative on the tobacco-tinged finish. Not bad, but I prefer some of the domaine's premier crus.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Echezeaux Grand Cru,RP 93
219,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee Village,"The 2016 Vosne Romanee Village comes from five parcels scattered around the appellation. It has a delicate, crisp bouquet with red cherry and strawberry scents unfurling nicely in the glass.

There is a pleasant earthiness right on the last quarter and a sappiness drawing you back for another sip.",2016 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee Village,RP 93
220,Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits,"The 2016 Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits was affected 25% by the frost.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin and decent fruit concentration; however, it is marred by some rather otiose, toasty new oak on the finish. How frustrating!

The 2010 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras from Lamarche has a bold, quite candied bouquet with dense black cherry and cassis scents that rather occlude the terroir expression. The palate is sweet and generous on the opening, rounded and opulent with a lot of extraction given the vintage. Yet there is a nagging feeling that it is a little monochromatic on the finish. Not bad, although I suggest that winemaker Nicole Lamarche has subsequently produced better wines from the vineyard in 2013 and 2015.

The palate is very well balanced with fine tannin, nicely pitched acidity and a silky smooth texture. This seems to glide across the palate and leads to a finish that has superb tension and mineralité. It has a little more buff and polish than the regular cuvée, two sides of the same coin in many ways.","2015 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue ""Cuvee 1959"" Grand Cru",RP 93
224,Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2015 Bourgogne Rouge comes from five parcels: Les Champs d’Argent, Lutenière, two in Les Piquiers and one in Poirier d’Aout. It has a pretty, floral bouquet that is bashful at first, but appeared to open in the glass with red cherries and crushed strawberry aplenty. The palate is smooth and caressing in the mouth, well balanced and quite chirpy towards the finish with a judicious twist of bitter cherry to lend this edginess.",2015 Domaine Lamarche Bourgogne Rouge,RP 93
225,Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Passetoutgrains,"The 2015 Bourgogne Passetoutgrain has a simple, but ample bouquet with small red cherries and kirsch-like aromas.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple and very fine, almost filigree tannins. The acidity is beautifully judged here -- very focused and refined, seamless towards the sophisticated finish. This is one of the best vintages of La Grand Rue that I have tasted, which is a considerable achievement given that this was not an exemplary growing season.

227,Francois Lamarche,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru was backward and tight-lipped on the nose despite vigorous aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly coarse tannin at the moment, hints of Earl Grey and bay leaf infusing the dark berry fruit, broody and almost Malconsorts-like in structure towards the finish. This has real density and ambition. Afford this several years in the cellar and you will have one of the best Echézeaux from this vintage.

The palate is medium-bodied with grippy tannin, a fruit-forward Vosne-Romanée, gutsy and bold, a wine of substance if not finesse at the moment. I mentioned that it was ""foursquare"" in barrel and it still conveys that in bottle. Give it 4-6 years in bottle.

231,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru has a gorgeous bouquet that actually reminds me of the late great Philippe Engel in terms of its purity and articulation of terroir. This is going to be very seductive. The palate is medium-bodied with svelte tannin and plush in the mouth, but that belies the structure underneath. Beautifully balanced with a smooth finish that is an absolute delight. This is simply a wonderful wine that will repay time in bottle.

232,Francois Lamarche,"La Grande Rue ""Cuvee 1959"" Grand Cru","The debut 2014 La Grande Rue ""Cuvée 1959"" Grand Cru comes from a small plot of vines that was exchanged with Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, so that they could complete the monopole of La Tâche as part of ""remembrement"" -- which basically means grouping land together. These were specifically three parcels that came to just 0.1013 hectares (plus a postage stamp of Les Gaudichots""). Nicole Lamarche was prompted to bottle it separately having found out about the exchange in Allen Meadows' ""Pearl of the Côte"" tome and it represents just two barrels. It has a very precise bouquet, the fruit a touch darker than the regular La Grande Rue, coveting its mineral core at first but after a few minutes it opens up gloriously. The palate has a touch more structure than the regular bottling, with dark cherries, minerals, strawberry pastille and a very intense finish that fans out gloriously. Just 600 bottles produced, though Nicole informed me that it is not a one-off and will be made henceforth. ","2014 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue ""Cuvee 1959"" Grand Cru",RP 93
233,Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"The 2014 La Grande Rue Grand Cru has a wonderful bouquet similar to the Grands Echézeaux, though at the moment albeit without the same degree of complexity. Perhaps this is just more backward at the moment. The palate is very well balanced with a keen line of acidity, nicely structured, perhaps just a little more conservative than the Grands Echézeaux, but maybe that means it will offer more once in bottle. One has the sense of a La Grande Rue just biding its time. Hopefully one day I will find out its qualities once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 93
234,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has a slightly more floral bouquet than the La Croix Rameau and that lends it more volume, more puissance. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, very understated at first, unfurling with time in the glass, very elegant and smooth with fine nervosité on the finish.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, beautifully balanced and pure, belying the structure towards the finish that suggests this will give ten to 15 years of pleasure, possibly more.

Whatever...it has a complex bouquet with red cherry fruit, dried orange peel and rose petals, very complex and engaging. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, very precise, almost understated. This is not a powerful wine like the Suchots, but it is very precise and engaging, slips down the throat with almost too much ease. ",2014 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee 1er Cru la Croix Rameau,RP 93
239,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee Village,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée Village matured in around 30% new oak, has a ripe, slightly candied, joyful bouquet with pure red cherry fruit, well defined and pure. The palate is well balanced with slightly chalky tannin on the entry, a gentle grip, just a touch of hardness towards the finish -- but that will soften with time in bottle. Give it a year and you will have a very decent, pleasurable, perhaps sensual Vosne-Romanée Village. ",2014 Domaine Lamarche Vosne Romanee Village,RP 93
240,Francois Lamarche,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Chaumes,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes has a charming bouquet with vibrant red fruit, a touch of Indian spice in the background, something a little edgy and Oriental here.

The 2012 La Grande Rue Grand Cru from Lamarche has a fabulous bouquet that gently unfurls in the glass: fine mineralité and tension, wonderful precision here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tensile tannin, crisp and poised, tightly wound and certainly needing several years to really show its mettle, but a great wine that is both understated yet intense.

The 2012 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru has a touch of volatility on the nose that gives the red fruit, raspberry, wild strawberry and pomegranate, a pleasant lift, though it is not as refined as the example from Domaine du Clos Frantin. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded ripe tannin. There is more complexity here than on the nose, fine structure with spice and mineral notes, though it needs to fan out more on the finish.

The 2012 Echézeaux Grand Cru from Domaine François Lamarche offers brambly red berry fruit on the nose, a little rustic but the oak is nicely integrated with a subtle marine influence that emerges with time. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, not the most complex grand cru on the block, yet there is a sense of nonchalance and joie-de-vivre thanks to the freshness and tension bestowed on the finish.

Hints of cherry liqueur here with a slight reductive metallic note. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly dry tannin and some hardness deriving from wood tannins on the finish.

The 2012 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots from Domaine François Lamarche has a pretty bouquet with fresh strawberry and Morello aromas, well integrated wood and subtle mineral notes developing in the glass.

I will confess that I thought it was a Californian Pinot Noir! The palate speaks more of the growing season than the terroir, although it is pleasant and easy-drinking thanks to the ripe, almost saccharine red cherries and strawberry fruit.

252,Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"The La Grande Rue Grand Cru 2006 has a pastille-like purity on the nose, touches of black olive and iodine coming through with aeration. It does not quite possess the complexity of recent vintages, but it offers some chutzpah. The palate is medium-bodied and nicely focused, very sappy in the mouth but showing some toughness on the kirsch-tinged finish. Maybe another year or two in bottle will help this grand cru to coalesce. Maybe not?",2006 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 89?
253,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1952 Grands Echézeaux from Lamarche is an ""old dame"" of a wine. The bouquet is still vital with scents of decayed red berry fruit, singed leather, damp forest floor and Provençal herbs, all with quite exquisite delineation. The palate is not quite as convincing as the aromatics–yet they do not disappoint one iota. It is extremely well balanced with a nigh on perfect seam of acidity binding its delicate constituent parts together. Autumn leaves abound, rustic ferrous red fruit disappearing over the horizon like the rear light of the last train home vanishing in the distance. Elegiac for sure, but it still does not stint on doling out pleasure.  ",1952 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
254,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru has a strict and linear nose at first, a little aloof perhaps, but very well defined and focused with perfumed red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly grainy tannin, very good depth and yet it ""floats"" across the mouth, finally delivering the structure just on the masculine, austere finish. Again, it is very well proportioned and natural with a dash of spice lingering on the aftertaste. Utterly entrancing.",2013 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
255,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts came across as more surly and backward on the nose when I tasted it at the domaine. The fruit is darker than the La Croix Rameau with blackberry leaf, cranberry, woodland and tree bark aromas: complex but distant. The palate is therefore surprisingly succulent and fleshy on the entry. There is a lovely saline tang at the front of the mouth, commendable weight and real persistence and structure on the finish. Again, this is very elegant and intense, the aftertaste bewilderingly long! ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,RP 89?
256,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru La Croix Rameau, nestling just between Romanée-Saint-Vivant and the village (a propitious location) has a gutsy, energetic, vibrant bouquet that offers an equal measure of black and red fruit: blackberry, cranberry leaf, wet soil, and a light musky scent. This is complex and engaging. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, extremely well-judged acidity, edgy and tense, like a person waiting to say something vitally important. Not quite as long as Les Suchots, but beautifully poised, this comes highly recommended. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,RP 89?
257,Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Cras has a perfumed, floral bouquet that is very well defined, offering crisp black cherries, maraschino and citrus fruit. The palate is very well structured with fine tannin, perfectly judged acidity, a tangible backbone lending structure and weight towards the finish. Perfectly proportioned, I can see this ageing nicely over the next couple of decades. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 89?
258,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée Village comes from Lamarche's usual five parcels of vine. It has lucid ruby color. The nose is natural and refined: raspberry, strawberry and freshly tilled soil. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, slightly brittle tannins accompanied by good depth of slightly darker fruit than the Bourgogne Rouge: cranberry here, flanked by raspberry and blackberry. This is nicely structured with a harmonious finish that lingers in the mouth to complete an accomplished Vosne-Romanée Villages. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée Village,RP 89?
259,Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits,"Picked around October 12-13, when the maturity had stopped accumulating, the 2013 Hautes Cotes de Nuits has a broad and generous bouquet with raspberry preserve and light woodland scents, all ""transparent"" and harmonious. The palate is medium-bodied with chalky tannins, very well-judged acidity and very pure. This is one of the best wines from the Hautes Cotes that I have encountered. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits,RP 89?
260,Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge has an endearing nose that is a little charmer right from the start, offering ""perky"" red cherries and bergamot scents. The palate is underpinned by crisp acidity, bright and sharp in the mouth, leaving the palate refreshed immediately upon exit. Very fine ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Bourgogne Pinot Noir,RP 89?
261,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Grands Echézeaux 2011  from Lamarche clearly has more fruit concentration than the offering from Albert Bichot: raspberry and wild strawberry racing out of the blocks, subtle wilted rose petal scents and minerality. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, plenty of tart cherries and strawberry notes that gently build in the mouth. There is a gentle grip here and some unresolved oak to be subsumed, but there is great substance and length – the standout wine from Lamarche this year. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
262,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts 2011 has a deep, quite broody but well-defined bouquet with blackberry, raspberry and sous-bois scents. Perhaps there is a little stem addition here, but if so it is discretely covered. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe red cherry and raspberry fruit. This is controlled and nicely focused with a tangy, quite spicy finish that maintains precision. Give this aristocratic and graceful Malconsorts two or three years in the cellar at least – it’s a wine of breeding and class. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,RP 89?
263,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Croix Rameau 2011 is one of the best from Lamarche in this vintage. It has a bright and perky bouquet with cranberry and Morello cherry scents: very Vosne-like with fine definition, although lighter than its peers. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, fine tension and engaging tart cherry/citrus notes toward the finish. This is a lively, tensile Vosne-Romanée that punches above its weight. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,RP 89?
264,Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The La Grande Rue Grand Cru has one of the most precocious bouquets of the 2011 grand cru tasted blind. It offers a surfeit of kirsch, redcurrant jam, raspberry preserve and candied orange peel all struck through with tangible minerality and tension. The palate is sweet and pure with ebullient red brambly fruit under a veneer of new wood, but the two are effortlessly in sync. It gently builds toward an ostentatious and almost ravishing finish only confined by the limitations of the growing season. This is a hedonistic and luxuriant delight - all while upholding the essence of the vineyard. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 89?
265,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Clear ruby in color, the Vosne-Romanée Les Chaumes from Lamarche has a delightful, delineated bouquet with cranberry and wild strawberry scents, quite forward and confident. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy ripe tannins, plenty of succulent red cherry and strawberry fruit with nicely judged acidity. Good weight in the mouth, perhaps a little fat with an easy-drinking, pleasurable finish that exerts a gentle but insistent grip.",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,RP 89?
266,Francois Lamarche,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Echézeaux Grand Cru 2011 from Lamarche is showing a lot of reduction on the nose that makes it difficult for the fruit to express itself. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy, grippy tannins. This comes across as more masculine than its peers, nevertheless I appreciate the detail and focus on the linear finish. Returning after 10 minutes there is a more obvious chocolate note emerging on the finish that erases a little detail, but it is still a satisfactory grand cru, if not one that demands a truckload of superlatives.",2011 Domaine Lamarche Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
267,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Suchots 2011 is more reserved on the nose than their Chaumées, but there is a touch more complexity, the brambly red and black fruit infused with fine minerality and tension. The palate is smooth and rounded on the entry with a lot of extraction so that it feels plump around the middle. Juicy and pure, what it lacks in complexity is compensated by its saturated tannins and opulent blueberry-tinged finish that is just missing some persistence, cutting away before you have had an opportunity to show your gratitude. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,RP 89?
268,Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Cras 2011 from Lamarche has quite a ravishing, opulent and feisty bouquet that races out of the blocks with copious small dark cherries, cassis and spicy fruit. The aromatics are perhaps too ostentatious for my preference. The palate is very ripe, showy and juicy, although it does not possess the finesse or sophistication of the same cru from Louis-Michel Liger-Belair. One has the impression of trying too hard to be a Vosne-Romanée, and not quite pulling it off, perhaps due to a slight oxidation. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 89?
269,Francois Lamarche,Clos Vougeot,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Lucid ruby color, the Clos Vougeot ‘11 has a rather two-dimensional bouquet, quite earthy and needing more fruit -- a “flightless” bouquet. The palate is rather austere and masculine and I would have preferred more flesh towards the finish. I was initially quite severe with this wine, although it does improve in the glass, gaining some cohesion and vigor. Having said that, I still feel that this is not one of the domaine’s strongest efforts this year. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Clos Vougeot,RP 89?
270,Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2012 Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru comes from the family’s 0.30-hectare parcel split over three plots. It has a more mineral-driven bouquet than fruit-driven at the moment, with touches of cold limestone infusing the tart red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, open red berry fruit, good backbone and a somehow conservative and yet appealing finish. This is a Grands Echezeaux unapologetically classic in style, the terroir really showing through at this early stage, although I would like more matiere on the finish. Very fine. 

Domaine Francois Lamarche is renowned for its monopole La Grande Rue that lies on the opposite side of the road from Romanee-Conti, although its history is far less illustrious, at least until recent times when it has been great to see this domaine’s wines radically improving. La Grande Rue was apparently a wedding gift to Henri Lamarche given in 1933 (better than a toaster) although the monopole was not even a grand cru until a rare promotion in 1992, albeit at a time when it was recognized that yields were way too high. Nicole Lamarche has been the winemaker here since 2007, whilst her sister Nathalie is in charge of marketing along with her aunt. The harvest commenced on 22 September and lasted for five or six days and all cuvees include around 30% whole cluster fruit and underwent long malo-lactic fermentation. The samples were taken directly from stainless steel tank and will be bottled in approximately three months’ time. The wines of this domaine have a distinct style. They have always been lighter than their peers, prioritizing finer tannins and more red fruit than black. Just taste through say, Bernard Gros’ and Lamarche’s wines one after the other and you see for yourself two dichotomous expressions of the same patch of earth. I have a penchant for Lamarche’s style of Pinot Noir and appreciated and praised recent vintages, although apropos these 2012s, I have to admit that I was seeking just a little more substance, a touch more conviction percolating through. I enjoyed them, but mentally I found myself wanting to “gee them up”, muster more vigor and flair.

271,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts comes from a demi-hectare of vines split over two plots. It has a subtle, understated bouquet that initially seems lighter than several of its peers, but it is very nuanced with subtle tertiary, almost granitic scents infusing the patina of brambly red berries. With a few more swirls, there are lovely wild heather notes emerging. The palate is medium-bodied but more supple and fuller than the Les Suchots  - in fact, this has a Les Suchots like exuberance that is tailored towards the finish to suit a more upstanding, regal Malconsorts. There is a lovely black pepper note that lingers on the finish here. Very fine.

272,Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru La Croix Rameau comes from a tiny 0.21-hectare parcel of vines tucked into a plot between Romanee-Saint Vivant and the outbuildings of the village (there are just three exploitants.) It has a rounded, pastille-like purity on the nose: strawberry and just a hint of mulberry at the moment, developing nicely in the glass though. The palate is harmonious on the entry with light tannins, clean fresh and quite linear red cherry and raspberry fruit that segues into an edgy, citric finish that is very appealing. This is a lovely, unpretentious premier cru.

273,Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Cras comes from 0.37-hectares of vine under metayage. The nose is very fragrant with hints of dried flowers and incense infusing the dark berry fruit that unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a sweet, candied entry. The acidity is nicely judged and there is good structure on the slightly foursquare finish. Give this a year in bottle and you should have an attractive NSG that will last a decade or more.

284,Francois Lamarche,Clos Vougeot,"The Clos Vougeot should prove to be the best wine made by Lamarche in 1988. It is by far the most concentrated wine, exhibiting more body, tannin, and depth than his others. It also has an enthralling bouquet of intense berry fruit, and the potential to last up to a decade, a long period of time by Lamarche's standards.

285,Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"The Vosne-Romanee La Grande Rue is the pride and joy of this house, and has long been considered by outside observers to be capable of producing Grand Cru quality wine. However, as good as the 1988 is, it is no Grand Cru. It has good color, and is probably the best wine Lamarche has made from this vineyard in well over a decade, but it should have more depth and complexity. It is a medium-bodied, aromatic, stylish wine with attractive berry fruit and spicy new oak, but it lacks outstanding concentration and complexity.

306,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"The 2018 Vintage Port is a field blend aged for approximately 18 months in very old and large wooden vats. It comes in with 100 grams of residual sugar. This is the third straight declaration (2016, 2017 and this 2018) of a classic Vintage Port for Taylor's. When last seen, this was very good. Let's check in. This is an accessible Taylor's that drinks fairly well now, but it still shows some power. Most of all, though, the fruit is sensational. It's utterly delicious, with the young fruit ripe and rolling over the palate. This is coming along fast, so that with decanting, you might even drink it now, but that would be an error. It is not coming close to showing everything it has. In the back of my head, I am wondering a little about how fast this is coming around, so it seems, but it does so many things well, I can't be churlish right now. Let's see in time if it is going to be a long-haul wine, as I expect Taylor's to be.",2018 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
307,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 2017 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a field blend of typical grapes (like Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesca, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca) aged for 20 months in French wood. It comes in with 105 grams of residual sugar. When last seen, this was only a tank sample. A darker flavor profile than the regular Taylor's, more leaning to plums and blackberries, this shows all that great Taylor's fruit and welds it to a serious backbone. The regular Taylor's seems a bit brighter, while this seems a bit sterner and richer, but at this point in their very young lives, I am not sure there is a lot to choose from qualitatively. That may change, in favor of this, I think, as they go further into their very long lives. Today, there isn't much to separate them except style and price. I'd take this, both for the style and the upside potential, but the price spike is certainly worth noting for many, while the qualitative difference is nominal.",2017 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
308,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"The 2017 Vintage Port is a field blend aged for approximately 20 months in wood. It comes in with 100 grams of residual sugar. Rich, concentrated and often sensational, this is well structured, even better in its fruit profile. While the fruit is terrific, it is also wonderfully fresh. This is arguably a great Taylor's, but it still needs to prove its final case in the cellar. I don't think that will be a problem. As I said when I first saw it, it effortlessly combines brilliant fruit and structure. It does everything right, and it is a formidable competitor to its Vinha Velha sibling in this report. And at half the price.",2017 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
309,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2017 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a typical Douro blend bottled in 2022 with a bar-top cork and 104 grams of residual sugar. This takes the lively Croft 2016, another of the Fladgate Group's houses, and adds a little depth. More importantly, it adds waves of flavor. It is well balanced and just delicious. The structure is average. On the other hand, while very well balanced, it is not quite as lively. Pick 'em. These can hold, but bottle development is not the same with filtered LBVs, so there is little reward to doing so. Drink up.",2017 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
310,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"The 2016 Vintage Port was aged for 20 months in wood and comes in with 102 grams of residual sugar. When last seen, this was a fine Taylor's, not my favorite, perhaps, but very fine. It is a little precocious in this elegant year, which is not to say there isn't a tannic backbone. Also, this did have a few hours in the glass. Still, the first and last impression is the big, beautiful fruit. It is a delicious Taylor's that is hard to resist. It also is firm on the finish and likely to evolve well. Complexity will come in time. I don't see any reason to change anything about my original evaluation just now. This is still too young to show much development.",2016 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
311,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"The 2003 Vintage Port is a field blend aged for approximately 21 months in oak vats. It comes in with 93 grams of residual sugar. This oldie will be rereleased soon. As much as the Fladgate Group's 2003 oldies in this report all have bragging points, this is Taylor's, and the structure takes the lead for all of them. Still a wee bit tight, this is far younger than the Croft, not fully mature or at peak and classic Taylor's. The remaining tannins support the fruit perfectly, but nothing to me is better here than the flavor profile. This is a fine Taylor's, still with plenty of room to evolve and improve. It could actually use a few more years, not to tame the tannins, but to acquire more maturity. Of the three (including Croft and Fonseca), this is the winner, but the Fonseca shows better today and the Croft seems to be at peak. So, cellar this a bit more and drink the others now.",2003 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
312,Taylor's,50 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 50 Year Old Tawny Port is a field blend bottled with a bar-top cork in 2022 and with 158 grams of residual sugar. Mature, with dark chocolate nuances, this is rich, deep and sensationally delicious. The concentration is exceptional too. Then, there's the long, long finish, filled with fruit and sugar. It is irresistible, in addition to being nuanced and complex. It's young enough so that it is never just a curiosity. The fruit is certainly not cracking.",NV Taylor Fladgate 50 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 95
313,Taylor's,Very Old Tawny Port Kingsman Edition,"The NV Very Old Tawny Port Kingsman Edition is a field blend bottled in 2020 with an average time in barrel of 90 years. It has 206 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. As always, old Tawnies are simply a joy to just smell, but that's nowhere near the best part here. Unctuous in texture and very concentrated, this still manages to be rather elegant, with some brightness and lift to the fruit to go with the power on the finish. It does show its age a bit on opening, but it held perfectly for the relatively short time I had with it. The finish is more dark molasses than caramel, as befits a very old and aging Tawny. The key here, though, is the combination of brightness with the unctuous and almost creamy texture. The two make an enchanting combination that leads to a long, lively and tasty finish. This is pretty fine, and you would expect nothing less from a special presentation by Taylor's. The winery's website mentions a touch of British humor regarding this bottling (and its connection to the Kingsman film series), but there's nothing funny about this. It's pretty serious stuff. 

The end-date drinking window is just a suggestion, and usually an afterthought, as few bother to hold old Tawnies very long. It doesn't need aging and they tend to last a very long time, barring cork problems. This comes in a special presentation, as these rare Tawnies usually do. The package includes ""a bespoke crystal decanter with gold detailing and a luxurious presentation box."" There were just 700 bottles produced.",NV Taylor Fladgate Very Old Tawny Port Kingsman Edition,RP 95
314,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a typical Douro blend bottled in 2019 with a bar-top cork, 103 grams of residual sugar and 20% alcohol. This is a middle-of-the-road LBV in this vintage. Some have been bigger and deeper. A balanced performance with nothing striking but everything in its proper place, this 2015 is average in concentration and nicely aromatic. It shows average structure. There's just a bit of bite on the finish. Of course, it is very drinkable right now, and that is the idea. You can hold this a few years if you must, but that's very much not the idea. So, dive in.",2015 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
315,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 2011 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 105 grams per liter of residual sugar. The youngest, fleshiest and fullest (perhaps because it is the youngest) of this vertical except for the unbottled 2017, this is also one of the most delicious. The fruit is so delectable that, at first, you don't notice how much pure power it has. Then, it's gorgeously textured, precise, focused and penetrating. 

This Vinha Velha is not ready, of course, but it is already more approachable and expressive than the 2009, as well as more generous. The fruit is simply more vivid. From the aromatics, with touches of eucalyptus, to the subtly rich feel, this is brilliant. Is it the best of the vertical? At the moment, it is not even close, but it is also the youngest and most immature of the bottled wines. In fruit, structure and aromatics, it has all the components for greatness. This doesn't show the best today, but it's worth betting on it for the long haul.",2011 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
316,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 2009 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. One of the fleshiest wines in the vertical—from a very warm year—this has plenty of power and fine depth, hallmarks of the vintage. This was not always received as well as some lusher vintages, but it was likely also far more closed when young. This is a relative powerhouse even now, stern and dramatically different than the lusher and sexier 2007, for instance. For me, always obsessed with structure, it rings the bell. Laced with herbs and dried fruits, this is mightily impressive on its own terms, though. It adds a long finish, but it shows no trace of maturity anytime in the near future. The fruit is sappy but very dry. For all of its power, it retains some elegance, and it is vaguely approachable. The key word there is ""vaguely."" Do you want to enjoy it or just fight off the tannins?

This is another brilliant Vinha Velha, even if often underrated, probably thanks to its somewhat brooding demeanor. Even now, it is a relatively backward one that needs much more time to express itself. Drink it if you must now, but you'll probably regret it.",2009 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
317,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 2007 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 101 grams per liter of residual sugar. The most aromatic in the vertical, this is laced with eucalyptus and cistus nuances. This is the point in the vertical where the wine really is just too young and too tight to enjoy to its fullest. The fruit is pretty spectacular, though, even as it retains its mid-palate finesse. This and the 2000 may have to duke it out for the title of ""Sexiest Port in the Vertical."" But that's not all. It adds firmness to the great fruit and aromatics. 

This could use another few years, not that it is wholly unapproachable. This is a good candidate for the best of the vertical, but the 2000 benefits from being more complete, mature and sensational for the moment. Still improving, this may fill that role as well one day.",2007 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95

It comes in with 94 grams per liter of residual sugar. Flamboyant on the nose, although not as much as the 2007 is, this is solid in the mid-palate and is almost drinking decently now. Almost. The tannins are not too astringent, making this surprisingly approachable at this young age, but that is a relative comment. More aeration still makes this close up. It then seems very firm and much sterner. To me, this hasn't quite reached the point where you really will want to drink it, but it's not impossible and not far from becoming more harmonious. If you must dive in, give it some air. This is a very fine but not a truly great Vinha Velha.",2004 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
319,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 2000 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 88 grams per liter of residual sugar. Full-bodied, relative to this elegant vertical, this also is one of the most delicious in the group, lush, sexy and irresistible. There are touches of chocolate and a long finish. It is just a bit more mature than the 1997, but certainly far, far more expressive while still showing impeccable balance. It is still youthful enough to tighten with air, though. There is brilliant structure to go with brilliant fruit. A couple of hours after being poured, it was better than my first taste. This was one of my favorites, one of the greats of this vertical. The only argument here that anyone can have is how great it is. Right at the moment, I'm thinking ""pretty great."" This is also a good time to approach it. It has a long life ahead, but it is sexy and succulent now.",2000 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
320,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 1997 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 92 grams per liter of residual sugar. Far younger and far livelier than the debut vintage (1995) that led off this vertical, this is elegant in the mid-palate, but that's where the graceful demeanor ends. It is one of the hardest-edged of the older wines. It is sharp on the finish and showing plenty of pop, even if it is not overly astringent. It's not the fleshiest wine, but it has that enchanting elegance to go with its lively feel. 

The balance overall is impressive. The complexity has not yet arrived. It still needs time to show a better expression of fruit. It is built for the long haul, surprisingly on the immature side. It's a dramatic contrast to its older sibling the 1995. This might yet improve.",1997 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
321,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,"The 1995 Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port is a typical field blend aged in used French oak vats. It comes in with 93 grams per liter of residual sugar. This was the debut vintage of the Vinha Velha, and it leads off the vertical this issue. Drinking perfectly now, this has chocolate and caramel, seeming very much like a gentle, mature and harmonious Port, but it has neither profound complexity nor a lot of power. It is, however, sensual and appealing, wonderful to drink now. It likely won't get better at this point, but I was pleased to see it expand in the glass and improve even by my last taste. 

I'd want to drink this now, personally. Adrian Bridge suggested it had reached its mature plateau, and I agree. It will hold on that plateau reasonably well, perhaps longer than anticipated, depending on how you like them. Of course, most wines, especially Ports, don't fall off the table. It has plenty of life left in a literal sense. When it declines, the decline will be slow and long.",1995 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velha Vintage Port,RP 95
322,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2014 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a typical Douro blend bottled in 2018 with a bar-top cork, 101 grams of residual sugar and 20% alcohol. Deeper than its sibling (the Fonseca LBV this issue) on opening, this still lacks that wine's personality, enticing aromatics and more intense flavors. This did seem more powerful and brooding, the structure more impressive than its fruit. It also seemed brighter and livelier, however. The next day, things changed. This no longer seemed any deeper than the Fonseca, which fleshed out and then showed even more power. Plus, the Fonseca seemed more tightly wound. They both retain plenty of power for LBVs, though. The flavor profiles remain a bit different, obviously. In a tough Douro year, this is a good performance, but the fruit is not overly expressive. Give the edge this year to the Fonseca. This is, of course, ready to drink now and needs no particular development time.",2014 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
323,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,"The 1969 Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port comes in with 158 grams of residual sugar. It was bottled in November 2018 with a bar-top cork. The latest release in Taylor's 50-year Colheita program, this doesn't show a lot of energy, and it has a little bitterness on the finish. It is laced with a touch of treacle on opening, but that blends in well after some time. I enjoyed the complexity. It seems very mature in other ways, though, rather soft with relatively little intensity. That's all relative, of course. It still drinks well and tastes great in a very understated way. (I'd add that this, unlike most old tawnies, actually showed better as it warmed closer to room temperature.) Of recent releases in this program, I'd have to pick some of the others, granting that they aren't all here together. The next day, it tasted great, but it sometimes seemed a touch flat. For all of that, I still rather liked this for its freshness and elegance.",1969 Taylor Fladgate Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,RP 95
324,Taylor's,First Estate Reserve Ruby Porto,"The NV First Estate Reserve Ruby Porto is a blend of typical Douro grapes from Cima Corgo held for four years in used French oak. It comes in with 93 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is produced ""to commemorate the firm’s acquisition in 1744 of its first property in the upper Douro Valley, the Casa dos Alambiques at Lugar das Lages."" It's pretty tight on opening even though it was from a March 2017 bottling (although unless you can read production stamps, that isn't so easy to determine). Big, dry and rather powerful, this is rather intense on the finish. It shows both classic flavor and fine structure. It is a bit straightforward, though, tending to make its way with power more than any expression of fruit. Still, with its very reasonable price point, this is certainly a good bargain, seeming very much in the ""vintage character"" style.",NV Taylor Fladgate First Estate Reserve Ruby Porto,RP 95
325,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2013 Late Bottled Vintage Port was filtered and bottled in 2018 with a bar-top cork and 95 grams of sugar. This has a plum-and-chocolate fruit nuance supported by moderate tannins that give it some distinction to go with the tasty fruit. This is a pretty fine example of the style. These can hold in the bottle, but that's not the point here. They are not expected to develop, and they should be drunk relatively young.",2013 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
326,Taylor's,Reserve Tawny Port,"The NV Reserve Tawny Port is a blend of multiple grapes, some in a field blend, with an average age of eight years in barrel. It comes in at 113 grams of residual sugar. This is something different—Taylor's normally does not make a Reserve Tawny. Then, it also was bottled in an historical bottle (the Mateus Rosé bottle in shape is close). Finally, it is a one-liter bottle, not a 750-milliliter one, so take that into account with the rather hefty price for a Reserve Tawny. With that price, even taking that one-liter bottle into account, this has to deliver, right? It does. This is an overachiever for its young age, easily 10-Year quality (although Taylor's makes a pretty big 10—so perhaps that is not a good comparison with Taylor's own 10). It is fresh, complex for the style and very tasty, finishing with a sweet edge. The atmospheric bottle will make a nice gift, but it will be a pleasure to drink as well. This comes with a bar-top cork. Barring cork failures, it will age well, but tawnies do not need bottle aging. Dive in.",NV Taylor Fladgate Reserve Tawny Port,RP 95
327,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port,"The 2015 Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port is a field blend aged for 18 months in used French oak vats. It comes in with 103 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is the first look in bottle, after the original was seen last June as a tank sample in Porto. It is very much a creature of the vintage. Like most 2015s, this is on the lighter side in the mid-palate, but also like most, it is fresh and lifted, refined and graceful. It is the type of wine that doesn't hit you over the head but becomes ever more appealing as it sits in the glass. It's all about finesse and elegance. Suddenly, you realize how much you like it. After some aeration, it adds to its mid-palate refinement the dry, tight and steely edge it had in Porto. Compared to last June, it is oddly more expressive now (I find that they tend to close down after bottling and shipping), opening nicely with some air. It does eventually close down more, but it drinks well again the next day, showing very good balance. When all three of the Fladgate group wines I re-evaluated for this issue (Croft, Fonseca Guimaraens and this) were tasted again the next day, this was plainly the best, beautifully balanced and lingering nicely on the finish. It does everything well.",2015 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port,RP 95
328,Taylor's,30 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 30 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in February 2016 with a bar-top cork and comes in with 126 grams per liter of residual sugar. The last release of this I saw was the 2014. Obviously, the differences are typically small from year to year and they are not side by side, but this didn't show quite as well early on, whether due to it being a different release or just a different context. It shows good concentration while retaining some mid-palate finesse. It is complex, then it adds a powerfully intense finish laced with burnt orange peel and molasses as it warms. If I had a quibble, there was some noticeable alcohol, especially when retasted the next day. Some three or four days later, it was far smoother, but it is always a little edgy. Overall, this is a fairly stern style, dry and brooding, with that hint of spirits in the background. It reminds me of the stereotypical scene with Port (or Cognac), cigars and blue cheese. It just has that serious feel to it, along with that long finish. It seems to be one, as discussed in the accompanying article, that leans more to a 40-year Port. As always, these last indefinitely, barring cork failures, but they are not really meant to be held.",NV Taylor Fladgate 30 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 95
329,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port,"The 2004 Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port comes in with 94 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is currently being rereleased and it is a fine bargain. Wide open and expressive (at least with double decanting the night before), this is laced with a touch of bitter chocolate and underlying steel. It shows finesse and elegance, too, while the tannins calm down fairly well, at least after the decanting that it had. Winemaker David Guimaraens said to me that this 2004 was, for him, a ""typical Vargellas...the single quinta star of the decade."" It is not a superstar, but it is lovely, starting with its fine flavor and ending with its crisp edge. Showing some mature nuances, it has developed some complexity and has passed from the primary stages. It easily has the wherewithal to continue developing in the cellar. It isn't the most concentrated Porto, perhaps, but it is notable for its precision, freshness and the delicious, long and juicy finish. It should continue to age nicely for a few decades. It is approachable now (with some decanting), but not quite at its peak.",2004 Taylor Fladgate Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port,RP 95
330,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,"The 1968 Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port comes in with 173 grams per liter of residual sugar. Taylor's started its ongoing 50-year Colheita program with the 1964 (or, as they prefer to say, ""single harvest tawny port""). This is the newest release, scheduled to be in the marketplace by the Fall of this year. It was bottled in 2017 with a bar-top cork. It is hard to go wrong with any of the wines Taylor's has been releasing in this series—they all have something special to offer. We can debate endlessly which is better—often, the style difference is more important than a minor qualitative difference. This year's style shows finesse and more finesse. It is relatively elegant for an old tawny, with a controlled, sweet edge. Hints of brandy do periodically pop up, but they are not hard or harsh. It lingers beautifully on the finish as fine, old Tawnies do. The finish is often the best part of these oldies. This will last indefinitely, but it is meant to drink on release and needs no aging. Most do not hold Tawnies with bar-top corks. Drink it around 60 degrees Fahrenheit—and definitely not too warm. Most producers recommend 58 to 62 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on your preferences and the wine.",1968 Taylor Fladgate Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,RP 95
331,Taylor's,Taylor's 325th Anniversary Reserve Tawny Port,"The NV Taylor's 325th Anniversary Reserve Tawny Port is a field blend that comes in at 108 grams per liter of residual sugar. Already in the marketplace, it was bottled in 2017 with a bar-top cork and an old type of bottle—a sort of ""Dutch Onion,"" a 1696 replica—in celebration of Taylor's 325th Anniversary. There are both young and old components to this, the ""best wines"" originally destined for Taylor's 10- to 40-year-old Tawnies. It is, however, closer to a young Tawny at only eight years in average age, even with some dollops of those older components that give it just a little extra complexity. Despite the fancy bottle and the anniversary, this Reserve was meant as a celebration at a nice price, not an unaffordable and awe-inspiring trophy. Taylor's typical 10-year Tawnies compete well with it, candidly, and probably best it. Still, bright and fresh, it is a lively young Tawny that has fine precision and a youthful feel, with just a bit of that complex edge, a touch of caramel and chocolate. It's worth buying just for the atmospheric bottle, but the wine is nice, too, a bit of an overachiever for a Reserve Tawny. These theoretically last a long while, of course, but it is made to be drinkable on release, not held. Drink it a little cool.",NV Taylor Fladgate Taylor's 325th Anniversary Reserve Tawny Port,RP 95
332,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,"The 1967 Very Old Single Harvest Port is Taylor's new release in its ongoing 50-year Colheita program (or, as they prefer to say, ""single harvest tawny port""). This should just recently have been released into the marketplace by the time this review appears. It is a typical Douro blend, coming in with 163 grams per liter of residual sugar and 20.7% alcohol. Taylor's series of 50-year single-harvest tawnies are impressive and always on the mark. This year is no exception. This molasses-flavored beauty emphasizes its complexity, seeming elegant in the mid-palate, but remarkably concentrated in flavor. Despite that concentration of flavor, this never seems even a little jammy. It is also wonderfully persistent on the finish. The most notable features here, though, are the smooth, unctuous texture and the complexity--the mature flavors, not only molasses, but a bit of seared caramel. It was interesting revisiting this a few days later, by the way. Some say these long-aged tawnies never change. I never believed that was true and this is a good example. On opening, there was a touch of a hard edge and it was sometimes just a little harsh on the finish. A couple of days later that was literally gone and after a week or more, this seemed remarkably graceful and impeccably balanced. It eventually seemed even a touch understated. This was bottled in 2016 with a bar-top cork. As noted on occasion, wines aged this long in barrel can in theory last indefinitely, assuming no cork failures, but it is ready and the bar-top cork means it is meant to drink now.",1967 Taylor Fladgate Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,RP 95
333,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2011 Late Bottled Vintage Port (bottled in October 2015) is a field blend aged for 58 months. It comes with a bar top cork and 106 grams per liter of residual sugar. Inky black, this highly extracted Port has sensual texture and an unctuous finish laced with delicious, primary fruit flavor. It's a rather sexy LBV this year, big, dense and mouth-coating. It has a fair bit of power, too. For an LBV to drink now, this is simply beautiful. It is not necessarily expected to go anywhere--it's made for drinking now--but it can certainly hold if you choose to do so, barring cork failures.",2011 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
334,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"The 1983 Vintage Port is up for a status check. It is in a pretty good place now. It's been as hard as nails over the years. Not anymore. With softened tannins and a medley of old Port flavors on the finish, this is both sensual and delicious, with velvety texture and an irresistible finish. It doesn't have that hard edge any more, but it does wake up and become more intense with some air. At least from this bottle, it comes together rather promptly and drinks well. It's lacking just a bit of firmness, but its complex flavors and general demeanor make it rather sexy. The lingering finish seals the deal. It can keep going for quite some time--it is Port and they tend not to drop off the table if well stored--but this is a nice time to dive in.",1983 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
335,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,"The 1966 Single Harvest Tawny Port (i.e., a Colheita) is a traditional blend, aged in French and American oak. It comes in at 183 grams per liter of residual sugar. Surprisingly rich and fresh, this seems younger than its age. The complexity here is not quite as great as with some and the nuances of molasses and the like are controlled. On the other side of the coin, it has a rather sensual texture, finishing with a sugary burst. Underneath is the expected acidity and a bit of pop. Overall, it is rather seductive and quite delicious. Note that this will be released in January 2016, part of Taylor's old Colheita releases.",1966 Taylor Fladgate Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,RP 95
336,Taylor's,40 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 40 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled with a bar top cork in 2014. It comes in with 125 grams per liter of residual sugar. Big, weighty and mouth filling, this is an aromatic Tawny that finishes with acidity and tension. Gripping on the finish, its flavors become more interesting as long as it sits in the glass (or on your palate). It is not, perhaps, as sunny as the Fonseca, its sibling reviewed this issue, but it is denser and more gripping. Comparing to the Taylor 30 (also reviewed), I'm not sure I liked the 40 here all that much better. The 30 is a bit fleshier while this 40 is a bit more concentrated in flavor and aromatics. Perhaps some additional age also helped this 40 combat some of the aggression on the 30. They are both pretty fine, a difference of five to Midnight and five after, rather than night and day.  It is still a fine experience and my favorite of the group. Don't drink it too warm. Room temperature is mostly too warm. The sweet spot for most tends to be 58-62 degrees Fahrenheit.",NV Taylor Fladgate 40 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 95
337,Taylor's,20 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 20 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in 2015 and comes in at 111 grams per liter of residual sugar. On first taste, this was simply Taylor: big, concentrated and serious. It was all that and a bag of chips, but over a couple of day it also demonstrated far more elegance. It seemed arguably better balanced than the 10 year old Tawny this issue. Simply filling the mouth on first taste, this shows fine complexity for its age and it does everything else rather brilliantly. Succulent and inviting, it finishes with waves of concentrated flavors. The fruit remains lifted and and it has a bright, transparent feel. It is hard to resist, often seeming like a bit of an overachiever. It's not the best tawny Taylor's submitted this issue, but it might be the best intersection of quality and price.",NV Taylor Fladgate 20 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 95
338,Taylor's,10 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 10 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in 2014 with 105.23 grams per liter of residual sugar. Easily the 10 with the most weight in the Fladgate group's lineup this issue, it is a rather powerful 10 year old Tawny with plenty of pop, the biggest and baddest of the trio (Fonseca, Croft and this). There is very fine concentration of flavor for a 10 year old Tawny. If I had a quibble, the alcohol shows at times, especially early on and rather notably when drunk a little too warm. (Around 60 degrees Fahrenheit is a lot better than room temperature most of the time, to be sure, not just here.) Overall, the weight, complexity, mouth feel and grip on the finish still make this my favorite of the group of 10s submitted by Taylor Fladgate this issue, although it's close and there are some pros and cons. This comes with a bar top cork, i.e., not intended to be aged (although it most certainly can hold a couple of decades barring cork failures). ",NV Taylor Fladgate 10 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 95
339,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"Two bottles of Taylor's  legendary 1948 Fladgate Vintage Port were tasted, both ""rescued"" from the cellars of Corpus Christies college at Oxford University having lain there since release. And they were so different! This note comes from the bottle that showed much less volatility. It has a majestic bouquet that compared to the '48 Graham has more density, more ""thrust"" as it were. While the Graham has more delicacy and nuance, the Taylor's hurtles like a raging bull toward the senses with luscious raspberry preserve, soy, clove and sage aromas. It is brilliantly detailed: aromatics for whom the term ""tour de force"" was invented. The palate offers more density and weight than the Graham, more fruit concentration with layers of decayed red fruit intermingling with clove, sage, orange rind and a pinch of black pepper. Texturally sumptuous and rounded on the finish, it contains otherworldly length. It's not quite the perfect specimen that I have encountered in the past...but it comes close. One of the greatest Vintage Ports of the 20th century without doubt. Tasted May 2015.",1948 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
340,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"Taylor's 1945 Fladgate  Vintage Port has a deeper color than the '45 Graham. The aromatics are detailed with remnants of red fruit, wild mint, Cuban cigars and pencil box that seem to flourish with aeration, gaining more intensity with each swirl of the glass. The palate is exquisitely balanced and poised with perfect acidity. It does not quite possess the ""Doric"" pillars of the stentorian '48 Taylor's, but you could argue that this might offer more subtlety and finesse. Hints of raspberry, cedar, marjoram and maraschino cherries that remain quite linear and correct. This is a ""serious"" Port in keeping with the style of Taylor's, a Port that demands your respect. Perhaps the '45 Graham has more personality but the '45 Taylor's has the gravitas. Tasted May 2015.",1945 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,RP 95
341,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"Readers should note that the exact identity of the Port house apropos could not be confirmed, though I am convinced it was Taylor Fladgate. That might be a moot point when a bottle is this old and rare. Perusing the note of Michael Broadbent MW, this certainly fitted his description of the 1895 Taylors and the bottom line is that it was a magnificent specimen. Commensurate with its venerable age, it is pale tawny but clear in color. The nose is initially light with no sign of any oxidation. It then unfurls with rosewater and balsam scents, not a million miles away from my recollection of the 1900. Where it really delivers is on the palate. The core of sweetness is extant, lending this a noticeably honeyed texture counterbalanced by fine acidity. There is both an elegance and a sense of degraded richness here, mellow and smooth. This is no curio, rather an ancient Port that shrugs off its 119-years of age to cock a snook at some of the ""young 'uns"" tasted in the same flight. It attests the indefatigable nature of Taylor's.

342,Taylor's,"Vintage Port ""Quinta de Vargellas""","The 2012 Quinta de Vargellas Port, a typical Douro blend, was aged in large French oak vats for 24 months and bottled in 2014. It comes in at 103 grams per liter of residual sugar. This opens steely and gripping, with fine acidity, firmness on the finish and enough concentration in this lighter-styled vintage. The best of the trio submitted by Taylor Fladgate this issue, it does everything well and mostly exceeds expectations. It more or less combines a bit of the initial power displayed by the Fonseca and the expressiveness of the Croft, and adds silky texture, gloriously fresh fruit and fine flavor. It will need a little patience, but it will also be rather hard to keep your hands off of it. The good news is that it did seem to come around surprisingly fast, becoming a bit less impressive than on first impression. By Day 3, it was quite accessible and it drank fairly well. I still liked it a lot.","2012 Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port ""Quinta de Vargellas""",RP 95
343,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2010 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a filtered Douro blend aged in large oak vats. The first bottlings of this 2010 took place at the end of 2014 as represented here, ""with more to follow during the course of 2015,"" said the winery. This comes in with 106 grams per liter of residual sugar and was sourced from vines averaging 30-50 years of age. Soft and easy, this is a pleasing and very tasty LBV, but it is rather straightforward, with only modest concentration and structure. Some ripe tannins do emerge with aeration and it has enough wherewithal to drink well for five days, though. Its velvety texture may be its best feature, but then there is that scrumptious fruit and the delicious finish. Granting that it was not long in bottle when tasted, it did seem curiously reticent on opening, but it also improved over several days, a very good sign. If I had a quibble, while the fruit improved and became more expressive over several days, the alcohol became more noticeable as well. This is meant for early consumption, but if you happen to hold it, it won't fall off the cliff. It won't improve either. Enjoy it for its soft, sweet and easy fruit, flavor and texture.",2010 Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 95
344,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Port,"The 1965 Very Old Single Harvest Port, that is, a Coheita, single vintage tawny, is part of Taylor's continuing series of releases of old Colheitas.  A field blend of typical grapes, it comes in at 157 grams per liter of residual sugar. In the overall context of amazing old Colheitas, it may not take 1st prize, but it will strike anyone who loves them as pretty fine. Get ready for those aromatics that are powerful from several feet away.  Irresistible on opening, it has an up-front rush of sugar, concentrated aromatics and remarkable concentration of flavor on the finish. Laced with classic old tawny nuances, including a bit of molasses and treacle, it ends with a dark, burnished feel. The mid-palate depth is just average. There are some whiffs of brandy that are sometimes rather too obvious here and there, but not often. Overall, it is bright and lively, with its good acidity cutting through the sugar and concentrated flavors. The two balance each other well. Some tawnies are caressing and sensual; some are rich and lush; some lean more to bite and focus. This is in the latter category, but the price of admission here is that concentration of mature, old tawny Port flavors. The acidity and the sugar lace those flavors into the palate. It emphasizes treacle more as time goes on. It's pretty fine. Note: this was tasted from a 375ml with a bar-top cork.",1965 Taylor Fladgate Very Old Single Harvest Port,RP 95
345,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Tawny Port,"The 1863 has not been topped up to our knowledge and the records from W&K also do not record any. It was kept in two casks in a locked cage at their warehouse in Serpa Pinto here in Gaia. This wine was the great pride and joy of the Falcao Carneiro family and they only decided to release it having seen the success of Scion. Jose Falcao Carneiro is a very serious person and I believe that the special point about this wine was that it came from 1863 whereas the Weise & Krohn was founded in 1865. So the wine may well have been among the first that was purchased by the company’s founders. Certainly the lodge where it was kept has been rented by W&K since 1880. The wine is very dense with the very developed rim of olive color, which is always the indication of a very old tawny. It is also viscous with residual sugar at 224-grams per liter. The Baume is 10.3 and the pH is 3.53. Lead levels are high at 330 parts per billion but this would be expected from old Ports due to movement through brass fitting in the old days.” So we must doff our caps and bow before a fortified wine that never fully relinquished its flush of youth. If the Scion was Katherine Hepburn, this is Jane Russell. The 1863 Tawny is a Port from another time and another world, but whose pleasure is with us today.

I cannot remember the last time I encountered such a jaw-dropping drop of alcohol as Taylor’s 1863 Single Harvest Tawny Port. Since I was overseas for its launch, managing director Adrian Bridge kindly sent me a half-bottle, which was given a couple of weeks to recover in the fridge, next to the anti-bacterial yogurt and Japanese tonkatsu sauce, both disbelieving the sell-by date of this temporary occupant. Then I allowed the sample to gradually warm up for tasting, sharing the remainder with a couple of oenophiles, not just because of my boundless generosity, but because I was so keen to gauge their reaction vis-a-vis mine. Indeed, one experienced imbiber was a mere 140 years out when he guessed the vintage. That gives you an indication of how this 1863 performed. Let’s gather a little background information first.  The release of this 1863 came about after Taylor Fladgate acquired Weise & Krohn last year. Weise & Krohn were actually selling the 1863 in a pack that included an 1896. Taylor’s decided that the 1863 deserved its own individual bottling, thereby neatly serving as a follow-up to the successful Scion. As you might guess, luxury packaging is part of the deal and the 1863 Tawny has been issued across the world in 1,600 velvet-lined crystal decanters in maple burl veneer. Of course, this begs the question whether it should be sold as Weise & Krohn or as Taylor’s? I can see both sides of the argument, but in those days, all Port wines were sourced from dozens of growers and so perhaps whether it is Weise & Krohn or Taylor’s is a moot point. It is what it is.  And what it is, is a time-defying pre-phylloxera humdinger that’ll knock your socks off. Simply pouring the wine, I noticed how deep and clear the color was, the intoxicating sumptuous aromas filling the room long before I had put nose near glass. We find extravagant and luscious aromas of blackberries, black plum, camphor, rosemary, iris, caraway seed and walnut, fig jam, a quite extraordinary and heady bouquet. The palate follows suit with a sumptuous, quasi-viscous texture that instantly seduces the senses. It comes armed with a sweet and candied core of black and red fruit, yes fruit, because there is astonishingly little degradation here. It is a powerful and flamboyant tawny with quince and marmalade, later cloves, raisin and dried fig on the long flowing finish. It has such youth and vigor that part of me wondered whether I should be parsimonious with my score. Aren’t such antiquarians supposed to get old and offer secondary, third and fourth evolutionary aromas and flavors?  Perhaps like some readers, I speculated as to whether it had been given a little “rejuvenation” during its life. Adrian Bridge’s reply not only quashed that idea but went some way in explaining why it comes across so vivaciously in analytical terms.

346,Taylor's,Very Old Single Harvest Port,"I allowed my glass of 1964 Taylor’s Very Old Single Harvest Port a couple of hours to open up in the glass, monitoring its evolution along the way. It is not a shy or retiring Port. Clear mahogany in color with a slight green tinge on the rim, the nose races out of the blocks like a young terrier let free in the garden, with intense aromas of grilled walnut, smoke, brown sugar, hints of caramel and a fug of alcohol that ebbs with time. The palate is smooth and honeyed on the entry, a very seductive Port wine, quite sumptuous in style, but with enough volatile lift to maintain fieriness toward the viscous finish. I speculate that had the 1963s not been so prodigious, Taylor Fladgate would have elected to follow their 1960 declaration with a 1964. That is all in the past. It is a delicious Vintage Port firing on all cylinders, ready to drink and enjoy now rather than cellar.

Returning after one 45 minutes that nose has shut up shop. The palate is sweet and sensual on the entry, plush and opulent, with copious black cherries, boysenberry and cassis fruit, curiously more reminiscent of Fonseca! It just glides across the palate with a mouth-coating, glycerine-tinged finish that has a wonderful lightness of touch, demonstrating how Vintage Port is so much more accessible in its youth nowadays.

353,Taylor's,Vintage Port,"Taylor's 1992 Vintage Port is unquestionably the greatest young port I have ever tasted.  It represents the essence of what vintage port can achieve.  The color is an opaque black/purple, and the nose offers up fabulously intense aromas of minerals, cassis, blackberries, licorice, and spices, as well as extraordinary purity and penetration.  Yet this is still an unformed and infantile wine.  If Chateau Latour made a late-harvest Cabernet Sauvignon, I suspect it might smell like this.  In the mouth, the wine is out of this world, displaying layer upon layer of concentrated black fruits backed by well-integrated tannin and structure.  This is a massive, magnificently rich, full-bodied port that will be far more flattering in its youth than were such Taylors as the 1983, 1977, or 1970.  It possesses awesome fruit, marvelous intensity, and lavish opulence, all brilliantly well-delineated by the wine's formidable structure.  This monumental 30-50 year port is a must purchase for port aficionados.!  Also noteworthy is the fact that the 1992 Taylor commemorates the 300th anniversary of this firm, as evidenced by the special bottle Taylor used for this port.

354,Taylor's,Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port,"Taylor Fladgate's 1991 Quinta de Vargellas is the finest Vargellas I have tasted.  The opaque purple color is followed by aromatics that are more closed than most 1991s.  In the mouth, it is a wine of extraordinary richness and brilliantly delineated components.  This exceptionally rich, backward port possesses layer upon layer of fruit, a thick, chewy, unctuous texture, firm structure and tannin, and a finish that lasts for more than a minute.  It is an exquisite port that will age for 25-30 years.

355,Taylor's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"Taylor's 1988 Late Bottled Vintage is a dark, opaque-colored wine with rich, sweet, chocolatey, black-cherry flavors, and excellent ripeness and richness.  Although it does not reveal the complexity of top vintage ports, it is well-made and approachable.  Drink it over the next 20+ years.

When tasted against other tawnys, they all exhibit more aromatic personalities, greater fruit and ripeness, and a wonderful sweetness and length.  The Ten Year Old Tawny is a personal favorite, as well as the best bargain among these ports.  Importer: Kobrand, Inc., New York, NY; tel.

358,Dow's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2016 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a field blend bottled in 2022 with a bar-top cork and 110 grams of residual sugar after some six years in oak. Showing pure power, this is still intense after six years in wood. It's got very ripe fruit, perhaps a bit more than ripe, but it is the balance between power and fruit that is the bigger issue here. Most people don't age filtered LBVs, and they may be in for a surprise. It certainly does a lot right.",2016 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
359,Dow's,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port,"The 2019 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port, Dow's Douro Superior Quinta, is a 53/26 blend of Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional with 21% Sousão. Bottled in May 2021, it comes in with 100 grams per liter of residual sugar. Even more aromatic than its sibling, the Bomfim this issue, this is also more textured, more caressing on the palate. It is just as tight as the Bomfim, perhaps tighter, but it does seem to open faster. It also seems more precise and more seductive today. This is being released now, unlike the Bomfim, which will not be released for 10 years, part of the Symingtons familiar late-release program. At the moment, I'd take this, which might today be my favorite of the 2019 Symington Ports this issue. There were 985 cases produced.",2019 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port,RP 89
360,Dow's,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2019 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port blend is mostly a 38/26 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, plus 15% Sousão, 15% old vines and a dollop of Tinta Barroca for the rest. Bottled in May 2021 after about 18 months in old vats, it comes in with 99 grams per liter of residual sugar. Gloriously aromatic and very tight around the edges, this is an intriguing Bomfim that combines balance, expressive fruit and considerable pop on the finish. Dark in color and very tasty, this likely will be an understated beauty in a decade, although its mid-palate is more on the elegant than the concentrated side. No pricing was available at this time, as this will not be released for 10 years, part of the Symington late-release program. As noted with some other wines in the same category, that's a good thing, because this needs some time. It should round into much better form when finally released.",2019 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
361,Dow's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a field blend bottled in 2021 with a bar-top cork and 106 grams of residual sugar after some six years in oak. Elegant and chock-full of fruit, this has some aromatic impact and reasonable depth. This is not as exuberant or as sweet in perception as the Graham's this report (that's a fairly common statement), but it walks down the middle of the road perfectly, often reasonably expressive and quite delicious. At first, it doesn't stand out as much compared to its Symington siblings this report (the Cockburn's and Graham's), seeming drier and more stolid, but the overall balance might be better, and it is certainly very tasty. There's a real backbone supporting the fruit. After a bit of time, this came around perfectly. Of the three, I'd pick the Graham's, while the Cockburn's fell off after a very impressive start. Reasonable minds might differ. They are all excellent. As with its siblings, it should hold well throughout the decade, maybe more, although that is not really the point with this wine.",2015 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
362,Dow's,Colheita Tawny Port,"The 2007 Colheita Tawny Port was bottled in 2019 with a bar-top cork and 119 grams of residual sugar. Sweet and luscious, this is a Colheita that goes for the hedonism. It doesn't impress all that much with its power, but in flavor, elegance and youthful exuberance, it is irresistible. It adds a fresh feel and good depth, plus those classic Tawny flavors that linger nicely on the finish. As I always note, Tawnies like this can hold a reasonable time, barring cork failures, but it is not really meant to be held, and it is ready now.

This is a particularly nice pick for value, by the way. There is a trio of 2007 Colheitas (including the Noval and the Romaneira) in this report. This was not my favorite because it doesn't have the same concentration and richness. Those show the depth of the big 2007 vintage. This does not. Arguably, though, this Dow's Colheita is more classic in style for its relatively young age, brighter and more graceful. There's a juicy finish that is pretty delicious, with the fruit always lifted. If you like this understated style, it certainly is a respectable competitor on its own terms, and it is priced significantly less.",2007 Dow's Colheita Tawny Port,RP 89
363,Dow's,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The 2018 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira, the Douro Superior quinta, is a blend of 45% Touriga Franca, 40% Touriga Nacional and the rest Alicante Bouschet and Sousão combined. It comes in with 106 grams per liter of residual sugar. Of the Symington group this issue, nothing is more intensely flavorful as this. It is certainly a step up on its Bomfim sibling this issue in concentration. Some in this set of Symington releases are equally perfumed. Some might be equally or more powerful. Nothing is more expressive except the Vesúvio, which is a bit of an outlier in this group. With violets up front and plums on the finish, it is delicious and sexy, until the hammer falls. There is plenty of power too. The next day, it shuts down. A few days later, it was drinking fairly well. 

This is one of the two Ports being released now, en primeur, by the Symingtons (the other being the Vesúvio). The question here will be when this comes into better balance. I'd sock it away until nearly the end of this decade, but it might be approachable sooner. There were 510 cases produced, a bit more than Bomfim, but still pretty small.",2018 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,RP 89
364,Dow's,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2018 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port, a single-quinta Port, is a field blend of roughly 70% Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional combined, 20% Sousão and 10% old vines. It comes in with 110 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is aromatic and delicious, with violets and blue fruits, but it is not particularly deep. It is certainly tight in its youth, as the power comes out with air, but it shows surprisingly well on many fronts. It did close notably on the second day it was tasted. Another 24 hours saw it blossom again. It is certainly one of the most delicious of the Symington offerings, expressing the quinta's terroir well. At that point, it was very sexy but a long way from monumental. The question here is whether the mid-palate depth will allow this to excel in the long run. I suspect not, but you won't regret buying it. You will have to wait to find out for sure how much better it gets—this will be late released, not yet determined but from seven to 10 years from the vintage date. There were just 400 cases produced.",2018 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
365,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The 2017 Vintage Port, bottled in May for release in the third quarter of 2019, is mostly a 42/38 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca with old vines and miscellaneous others (including about 8% Alicante Bouschet) for the rest. It was bottled about a month before this tasting after 18 months in seasoned vats, but the just-bottled sample was not actually used for fear it might be in shock. This, accordingly, was actually a pre-bottling sample. It comes in with 106 grams of residual sugar. 

Opening with dramatic color, this adds violets on the nose. It retains elegance while seeming subtly concentrated rather than jammy. Then, it finishes with pop and controlled power. For those who remember the powerhouse Dows in the past, that's not quite this for the most part. It is an accessible and elegant Dow, relatively speaking. Charles Symington said that the higher proportion of Touriga Franca compared to some years contributed to that. That said, this still has the structure to age and develop. It seems wonderfully fresh and lifted all the while, but it's neither rich, nor intense nor austere. This is a Dow that still needs some time to become more expressive and complex, though. There were 5,250 cases produced.",2017 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
366,Dow's,40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto,"The NV 40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto is a field blend coming in with 127 grams per liter of residual sugar. It was bottled in 2018 with a bar-top cork. While this continues to some extent the ""dry, stern and powerful"" feel of its siblings, this also has the most richness, the sweetest edge and the most ability to cut that stern aspect. The finish is long and delicious, laced with caramel and milk chocolate. Two days later, that was a lot clearer. It seems relatively young for a 40 until you note the concentration. It's easily the most concentrated of the group. It was also my personal favorite of the group, although I did tend to keep taking another taste of the vivacious 30. It may depend on what style you like—this 40 is about richness and concentration, while the 30 is brighter and livelier. In going from 30 to 40, of course, it's not always a night-and-day difference in terms of maturity. They are both very mature and satisfy that requirement well. They are both well done overall, and both to me seem much more interesting than their younger siblings.",NV Dow's 40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto,RP 89
367,Dow's,30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port,"The NV 30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port is a field blend bottled in 2018 with 134 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It is here in the lineup that you get a livelier Porto with a fine expression of fruit—but also a bit more of a brandy nuance, just a bit. It is a bit woody as well. The ""old tawny"" flavors then mingle with the brandy to create a dry and very serious feel. Still, this powerful tawny is gripping on the finish, intense and long. There's a spicy nuance on the fresh and juicy finish that I just loved. The fruit is nicely lifted, and it just seems very fresh. It was pretty delicious and surprisingly refreshing when tasted two days later. In the new Dow lineup, this might be the liveliest and the brightest, the one with the freshest feel. The 40 has other virtues and is equally if not more interesting, but this holds its own. I liked it a lot.",NV Dow's 30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port,RP 89
368,Dow's,20 Year Old Tawny Port,"The NV 20 Year Old Tawny Port is a field blend coming in with 126 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It was bottled in 2018. Dry and stern—this is the style you'd expect from the comments in the accompanying producer note—this shows off some wood, plus very fine concentration and power for the level. This is not always an open and friendly 20, though. The 30, actually, seems far livelier and more expressive (although woodier and more mature, to be sure). This 20 is one that intends to grab your palate and not let go. Some sweetness and a touch of spice around the edges redeem it. That counters the power and woody demeanor. It drank particularly well a couple of days later. On many levels, this is impressive for its age. It works well overall in its style.",NV Dow's 20 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 89
369,Dow's,10 Year Old Tawny Porto,"The NV 10 Year Old Tawny Porto is a field blend coming in with 115 grams per liter of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It was bottled in 2018. Some 10s are bright and lively. This goes in another direction. It opens with broad flavors, caramel and milk chocolate, not showing much complexity, which is as expected for a 10 Year Old; however, it adds surprising power for a 10. The fruit is not very expressive, as it finishes dry and stern. The mid-palate is solid for the level. While this doesn't have the intrigue of older bottlings, it is no slouch in that power department. There is plenty of grip on that finish.",NV Dow's 10 Year Old Tawny Porto,RP 89
370,Dow's,Trademark Finest Reserve Port,"The NV Trademark Finest Reserve Port is a blend of typical regional grapes aged up to three years in used wood. It was bottled in October 2018 with 108 grams per liter of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. This has reasonable solidity and structure, but its best feature is the expression of fruit. It has fine flavor and finishes well. It doesn't seem quite as precise or as lifted as some here, but it presents the impression of seriousness rather than simply being a light quaffer. It does thin out a bit with aeration, but that's to be expected in this category.",NV Dow's Trademark Finest Reserve Port,RP 89
371,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The 2016 Vintage Port, bottled in May for release in October  2018, is mostly a 48/31 blend of Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional, with various other grapes and some very old vines for the rest. It comes in with 111 grams of residual sugar. This is a very elegant Dow's, but there is certainly both power and concentration lurking underneath. Adding fine fruit, it is expressive and sophisticated, a very refined offering that seems not quite as burly as in some years. It is still exceptionally appealing, but it was curiously understated when seen. Some bottle shock, perhaps? The fresh 2016 Vintage? This is an illustration of Charles Symington's philosophy, as relayed to me, that the ""wines should be in harmony from the first day."" I don't think this will be a great Dow's, but it is an enjoyable one. If it wakes up, it might be entitled to an uptick. For the moment, between the top blends in the Symington stable, I'd lean to Graham's as the best in this vintage. Both are easily outclassed by the single-plot wines. There were 5,480 cases produced.",2016 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
372,Dow's,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The 2015 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira, the Douro Superior quinta, is a blend of Touriga Franca 55%, Touriga Nacional 35% and Sousão 10%. It comes in at 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is a relatively big boy on first taste, showing good structure and a mouth-coating demeanor. The delicious flavors, laced with cherry-chocolate and some mint, make it enticing, not just well structured. This is a lovely single-quinta that should age pretty well and still be approachable young. As it sat and aired, it became a bit more mute. It did seem to come around very fast, and it was not quite as impressive as the initial tastes suggested. It is still pretty delicious and it should hold well. This has been released. There were 700 cases produced, plus some large-format bottles.",2015 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,RP 89
373,Dow's,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2015 Quinta do Bomfim, a single-quinta Port, is a field blend coming in at 104 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is a wine that the Symingtons have scheduled for much later release—around 2025. Consider this a preview and a projection. It shows reasonable concentration for the vintage and reasonable power, but little stands out. Laced with dark plums and stonewashed flavors, it finishes dry and serious, with fine persistence. Conversely, it is not quite as vividly flavored as most 2015s. When it is released, it will be showing fairly well, I suspect. While it is nicely structured, the power is moderate for Dow's. In sum, this is lovely, but it should be approachable young and it won't exactly be the best ager Dow has ever produced. Still, it won't disappoint as a late release with undoubtedly attractive pricing. There were 1,000 cases produced.",2015 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
374,Dow's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2011 Late Bottled Vintage Port is bottled with a bar top cork and 105 grams per liter of residual sugar. It has reasonable concentration, but bigger aromatics. Sappy and intensely flavorful on the finish, this shows off a bit of muscle, too, but it is fully ready to drink and it shows very well. It's made to drink now. If well stored, it can last, but it's not meant to hold.",2011 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
375,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The 1994 Vintage Port is set for re-release. It has about 92 grams per liter of residual sugar. It's a beauty, with all that Dow power and structure that I've loved over the years--even after some hours of decanting. Intensely concentrated in flavor, without being jammy, this lingers on the gripping finish after starting with a touch of mint. Serious and brooding, it is not yet as complex and as developed as it could be--but this is Port and that will come in time. Be patient. In the meanwhile, if you must crack this now, give it a few hours in a decanter, to state the obvious. This is a terrific Dow's VP that is still growing and improving. It is still about its potential in some ways and it may well exceed expectations. It will certainly acquire even more complexity with more cellaring. Personally, I would try to give it at least another decade in the cellar.",1994 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
376,Dow's,Quinta de Senhora Da Ribeira Vintage Port,"The 2013 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port comes in with 100 grams per liter of residual sugar and was bottled in May 2015. It is a blend of 35% Touriga Nacional, 40% Touriga Franca, 15% Sousão and 10% Old Vines field blend. Showing very good concentration for the year and beautiful structure, this lovely Single Quinta Port is full in the mouth and very powerful in its youth. The beautiful fruit underneath announces its presence with some intensity--it tastes great, too. Palate coating and inky black, this should exceed expectations over the next couple of decades. After being opened for some five days, it sealed the deal. It became far more expressive, crisper and transparent. It also became remarkably delicious. It showed not a hint of fading or oxidation. It should age well. On the other side of the coin, you can approach it in several years with some decanting, but giving it about ten to 12 years from vintage date would be far better. Time will tell the whole story, but this seems pretty terrific right now and it still seems to have some upside potential as well. Notes: Part of Dow from 1890-1953 and reacquired in 1998, this Quinta is on the Douro's North Bank. There were 900 cases produced, plus some large format bottles.",2013 Dow's Quinta de Senhora Da Ribeira Vintage Port,RP 89
377,Dow's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2009 Late Bottled Vintage Port was bottled in 2014 after five years in oak. It comes in with 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. This has settled down since I first saw it. Although it is quite drinkable now, it is still big and burly with some tannic pop on the finish. The restrained sweetness and flavor turns rather complex on the finish. It is an LBV that seems a bit austere and intellectual at times, but that just helps it seem rather serious. It has great fruit, too. Note that this has a bar top cork and was filtered. It is not expected to improve much. It is intended to be drunk young, not aged, although it can certainly hold longer if the cork remains good.",2009 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
378,Dow's,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2004 Quinta do Bomfim comes in at 100 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is put together nicely. It is a more intellectual Single Quinta than its siblings this issue, but its best features should pay dividends over the long haul in the cellar. Dry and muscular, rather intense and focused, this is not actually quite ready to drink and will certainly benefit more from some cellaring or decanting. The precision and structure here should allow this to age gracefully and acquire more complexity, even if it is ""sort of"" approachable now. It should continue to improve over the next decade, at the least.",2004 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
379,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The Dow 1934 Vintage Port is certainly better than the 1920. For sure, it feels a little muted on the nose compared to the Sandeman '34, yet it opens with scents of clove, sandalwood and a light blackcurrant pastille scents. The palate is well balanced with a pinch of white pepper on the entry, nicely poised with just a hint of oxidation creeping in toward the harmonious finish. But there is something regal in this elegiac Port, a kingly character that has passed its majestic prime and yet is still compelling. Tasted May 2015.",1934 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
380,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The Dow 1920 Vintage Port, shipper unknown but almost definitely English, has a pale tawny/tuile hue. The nose is showing its age, creaking at the seams a little with grilled walnut and wood varnish coming immediately to mind, a little dustiness that recedes with time and reveals a faint minty scent. The palate is medium-bodied with a pleasing weight, a subtle caramel-like sweetness evident toward the finish that feels a little dry and austere, a touch feral compared to the 1920 Warre tasted alongside. I suspect this is simple a Vintage Port that is just long in tooth, yet that signature structure and masculinity of Dow is still present. Tasted May 2015.",1920 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
381,Dow's,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2009 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a filtered blend bottled with a bar top cork in 2014. It was just released in January 2015. It comes in with 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. Wonderfully fresh, sweet and charming on opening, this becomes a surprisingly focused LBV, even though it is easy to drink and does well as a pop 'n' pour. It has rather nice, underlying structure. The tannins are ripe, but there are some, and it has the grip and concentration of flavors on the finish to be interesting as well as tasty. It becomes more brooding and quite drier with aeration. Resampling it made me appreciate it more. A couple of days later, it was drinking far better, having fleshed out while still showing fresh, sappy fruit. Just for fun–since the bar top seems to encourage you to do that and LBVs are pretty resistant–I held it and experimented at Day 4 and Day 9. It was quite enticing on Day 4. On Day 9, it still drank rather well, showing good balance and structure, but there was also a hint of oxidation in the background. Overall, the mid-palate concentration is average for its type and there is little in the way of complexity at its young age–and it is not likely designed to age, even if can to some degree, which tends to give wines like this a ceiling. This is still overall a very nice performance in this big vintage. It is delicious, but also well balanced and intriguing. Enjoy it for what it is while it is young: well crafted, gracefully constructed and awfully tasty.",2009 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
382,Dow's,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The 2012 Senhora da Ribeira has an opaque color. The nose displays a lot of primal sucrose with creme de cassis, iodine and whole bunches of violets, later boysenberry jam – all very precocious and seductive. The palate is sweet on the entry, a soft and sensual fortified that gently builds in the mouth toward a harmonious finish of blackcurrant, black pepper, sage and Chinese five-spice. This is a clever release from this undeclared year. Drink 2018-2030+

383,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The 2011 Dow Vintage Port was made from no less than 44 separate ferments from finest fruit sourced from Quinta do Bomfim (35% of the blend), Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira (42%) and the Santinho (14%) and Cerdeira (6%) estates. Just six of the best lots were used in the final blend, which consists of 40% Touriga Franca, 36% Touriga Nacional, 10% Sousao and 14% of old vine plantings. It has a beautiful, quite extravagant bouquet with copious black and red fruit, Indian spice, and hints of menthol and orange rind that unfold wonderfully in the glass. The palate is a sumptuous affair, one that is beautifully balanced with velvety smooth, plump tannins, copious black fruit with a harmonious, white pepper-tinged finish that is a decadent delight. This is one of the finest of the declarations of 2011 Vintage Ports, a sublime expression of the vintage you would be foolish not to buy. This is Dow at its best. 5,000 cases have been declared.

The palate is medium-bodied with very good acidity and certainly not an opulent young quinta, but edgy and tannic towards the masculine finish. It is almost austere compared to its peers and yet with impressive substance and length. Certainly not the most approachable young port, it deserves at least a decade in the cellar. Drink 2020-2045.

The palate is medium-bodied with edgy tannins and displays a lot of volatility towards the finish that lacks flesh and length. This is a curiosity at best, although there may be better bottles out there. Past its best. Tasted October 2011.",1965 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
388,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The 2007 Dow’s Vintage Port is one of the stars of the vintage. A glass-coating opaque purple color, it offers up an already complex bouquet of mineral, pencil lead, licorice, spice box, and assorted black fruits. On the palate it is quite massive, slightly dry in the house style, and packed with fruit. It has the structure to be one of the long distance runners of the vintage taking as much as 20 years to reach its peak and drinking well through 2050.  As an aside, I was able to taste the individual components of this wine on the day prior to this tasting. The final blend is better than any of its parts.

389,Dow's,Vintage Port,"The complex aromatics of the opaque, black-colored 2003 Dow Vintage Port display chocolate, dried oak, black cherries, blackberries, copious spices, and a myriad flowers. This fresh, backward wine offers a medium to full-bodied, deeply concentrated core of spice-laced dark fruits. Softly-textured and seductive in the mid-palate, it boasts abundant layers of candied Damson plums, blueberries, black cherries, molasses, and hints of chocolate before revealing its firm structure. Extremely youthful and primary, this exceptional effort demands patience. Projected maturity: 2025-2045+.

394,Dow's,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"I thought this was a staggering example of port.  Dow's style tends to be more backward, but this opaque black/purple-colored wine reveals a huge, powerful, intense palate, with gobs of flesh and viscous fruit.  There is considerable tannin in the finish.  It is a massive port with no indication of excessive alcohol in the finish.  A magnificent young, dry-styled vintage port that just goes on and on in the mouth, it should last for 20-30 years.  The single Quinta ports are just as spectacular as any vintage port I tasted from 1983 or 1985.

Showing pure power, this is still intense after six years in wood. It's got very ripe fruit, perhaps a bit more than ripe, but it is the balance between power and fruit that is the bigger issue here. Most people don't age filtered LBVs, and they may be in for a surprise. It certainly does a lot right.",2016 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
404,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port,"The 2019 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port, Dow's Douro Superior Quinta, is a 53/26 blend of Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional with 21% Sousão. Bottled in May 2021, it comes in with 100 grams per liter of residual sugar. Even more aromatic than its sibling, the Bomfim this issue, this is also more textured, more caressing on the palate. It is just as tight as the Bomfim, perhaps tighter, but it does seem to open faster. It also seems more precise and more seductive today. This is being released now, unlike the Bomfim, which will not be released for 10 years, part of the Symingtons familiar late-release program. At the moment, I'd take this, which might today be my favorite of the 2019 Symington Ports this issue. There were 985 cases produced.",2019 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port,RP 89
405,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2019 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port blend is mostly a 38/26 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, plus 15% Sousão, 15% old vines and a dollop of Tinta Barroca for the rest. Bottled in May 2021 after about 18 months in old vats, it comes in with 99 grams per liter of residual sugar. Gloriously aromatic and very tight around the edges, this is an intriguing Bomfim that combines balance, expressive fruit and considerable pop on the finish. Dark in color and very tasty, this likely will be an understated beauty in a decade, although its mid-palate is more on the elegant than the concentrated side. No pricing was available at this time, as this will not be released for 10 years, part of the Symington late-release program. As noted with some other wines in the same category, that's a good thing, because this needs some time. It should round into much better form when finally released.",2019 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
406,Chateau de Fonsalette,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a field blend bottled in 2021 with a bar-top cork and 106 grams of residual sugar after some six years in oak. Elegant and chock-full of fruit, this has some aromatic impact and reasonable depth. This is not as exuberant or as sweet in perception as the Graham's this report (that's a fairly common statement), but it walks down the middle of the road perfectly, often reasonably expressive and quite delicious. At first, it doesn't stand out as much compared to its Symington siblings this report (the Cockburn's and Graham's), seeming drier and more stolid, but the overall balance might be better, and it is certainly very tasty. There's a real backbone supporting the fruit. After a bit of time, this came around perfectly. Of the three, I'd pick the Graham's, while the Cockburn's fell off after a very impressive start. Reasonable minds might differ. They are all excellent. As with its siblings, it should hold well throughout the decade, maybe more, although that is not really the point with this wine.",2015 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
407,Chateau de Fonsalette,Colheita Tawny Port,"The 2007 Colheita Tawny Port was bottled in 2019 with a bar-top cork and 119 grams of residual sugar. Sweet and luscious, this is a Colheita that goes for the hedonism. It doesn't impress all that much with its power, but in flavor, elegance and youthful exuberance, it is irresistible. It adds a fresh feel and good depth, plus those classic Tawny flavors that linger nicely on the finish. As I always note, Tawnies like this can hold a reasonable time, barring cork failures, but it is not really meant to be held, and it is ready now.

This is a particularly nice pick for value, by the way. There is a trio of 2007 Colheitas (including the Noval and the Romaneira) in this report. This was not my favorite because it doesn't have the same concentration and richness. Those show the depth of the big 2007 vintage. This does not. Arguably, though, this Dow's Colheita is more classic in style for its relatively young age, brighter and more graceful. There's a juicy finish that is pretty delicious, with the fruit always lifted. If you like this understated style, it certainly is a respectable competitor on its own terms, and it is priced significantly less.",2007 Dow's Colheita Tawny Port,RP 89
408,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The 2018 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira, the Douro Superior quinta, is a blend of 45% Touriga Franca, 40% Touriga Nacional and the rest Alicante Bouschet and Sousão combined. It comes in with 106 grams per liter of residual sugar. Of the Symington group this issue, nothing is more intensely flavorful as this. It is certainly a step up on its Bomfim sibling this issue in concentration. Some in this set of Symington releases are equally perfumed. Some might be equally or more powerful. Nothing is more expressive except the Vesúvio, which is a bit of an outlier in this group. With violets up front and plums on the finish, it is delicious and sexy, until the hammer falls. There is plenty of power too. The next day, it shuts down. A few days later, it was drinking fairly well. 

This is one of the two Ports being released now, en primeur, by the Symingtons (the other being the Vesúvio). The question here will be when this comes into better balance. I'd sock it away until nearly the end of this decade, but it might be approachable sooner. There were 510 cases produced, a bit more than Bomfim, but still pretty small.",2018 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,RP 89
409,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2018 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port, a single-quinta Port, is a field blend of roughly 70% Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional combined, 20% Sousão and 10% old vines. It comes in with 110 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is aromatic and delicious, with violets and blue fruits, but it is not particularly deep. It is certainly tight in its youth, as the power comes out with air, but it shows surprisingly well on many fronts. It did close notably on the second day it was tasted. Another 24 hours saw it blossom again. It is certainly one of the most delicious of the Symington offerings, expressing the quinta's terroir well. At that point, it was very sexy but a long way from monumental. The question here is whether the mid-palate depth will allow this to excel in the long run. I suspect not, but you won't regret buying it. You will have to wait to find out for sure how much better it gets—this will be late released, not yet determined but from seven to 10 years from the vintage date. There were just 400 cases produced.",2018 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
410,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The 2017 Vintage Port, bottled in May for release in the third quarter of 2019, is mostly a 42/38 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca with old vines and miscellaneous others (including about 8% Alicante Bouschet) for the rest. It was bottled about a month before this tasting after 18 months in seasoned vats, but the just-bottled sample was not actually used for fear it might be in shock. This, accordingly, was actually a pre-bottling sample. It comes in with 106 grams of residual sugar. 

Opening with dramatic color, this adds violets on the nose. It retains elegance while seeming subtly concentrated rather than jammy. Then, it finishes with pop and controlled power. For those who remember the powerhouse Dows in the past, that's not quite this for the most part. It is an accessible and elegant Dow, relatively speaking. Charles Symington said that the higher proportion of Touriga Franca compared to some years contributed to that. That said, this still has the structure to age and develop. It seems wonderfully fresh and lifted all the while, but it's neither rich, nor intense nor austere. This is a Dow that still needs some time to become more expressive and complex, though. There were 5,250 cases produced.",2017 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
411,Chateau de Fonsalette,40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto,"The NV 40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto is a field blend coming in with 127 grams per liter of residual sugar. It was bottled in 2018 with a bar-top cork. While this continues to some extent the ""dry, stern and powerful"" feel of its siblings, this also has the most richness, the sweetest edge and the most ability to cut that stern aspect. The finish is long and delicious, laced with caramel and milk chocolate. Two days later, that was a lot clearer. It seems relatively young for a 40 until you note the concentration. It's easily the most concentrated of the group. It was also my personal favorite of the group, although I did tend to keep taking another taste of the vivacious 30. It may depend on what style you like—this 40 is about richness and concentration, while the 30 is brighter and livelier. In going from 30 to 40, of course, it's not always a night-and-day difference in terms of maturity. They are both very mature and satisfy that requirement well. They are both well done overall, and both to me seem much more interesting than their younger siblings.",NV Dow's 40 Year Old Very Old Tawny Porto,RP 89
412,Chateau de Fonsalette,30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port,"The NV 30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port is a field blend bottled in 2018 with 134 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It is here in the lineup that you get a livelier Porto with a fine expression of fruit—but also a bit more of a brandy nuance, just a bit. It is a bit woody as well. The ""old tawny"" flavors then mingle with the brandy to create a dry and very serious feel. Still, this powerful tawny is gripping on the finish, intense and long. There's a spicy nuance on the fresh and juicy finish that I just loved. The fruit is nicely lifted, and it just seems very fresh. It was pretty delicious and surprisingly refreshing when tasted two days later. In the new Dow lineup, this might be the liveliest and the brightest, the one with the freshest feel. The 40 has other virtues and is equally if not more interesting, but this holds its own. I liked it a lot.",NV Dow's 30 Years Old Rare Tawny Port,RP 89

Dry and stern—this is the style you'd expect from the comments in the accompanying producer note—this shows off some wood, plus very fine concentration and power for the level. This is not always an open and friendly 20, though. The 30, actually, seems far livelier and more expressive (although woodier and more mature, to be sure). This 20 is one that intends to grab your palate and not let go. Some sweetness and a touch of spice around the edges redeem it. That counters the power and woody demeanor. It drank particularly well a couple of days later. On many levels, this is impressive for its age. It works well overall in its style.",NV Dow's 20 Year Old Tawny Port,RP 89
414,Chateau de Fonsalette,10 Year Old Tawny Porto,"The NV 10 Year Old Tawny Porto is a field blend coming in with 115 grams per liter of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It was bottled in 2018. Some 10s are bright and lively. This goes in another direction. It opens with broad flavors, caramel and milk chocolate, not showing much complexity, which is as expected for a 10 Year Old; however, it adds surprising power for a 10. The fruit is not very expressive, as it finishes dry and stern. The mid-palate is solid for the level. While this doesn't have the intrigue of older bottlings, it is no slouch in that power department. There is plenty of grip on that finish.",NV Dow's 10 Year Old Tawny Porto,RP 89
415,Chateau de Fonsalette,Trademark Finest Reserve Port,"The NV Trademark Finest Reserve Port is a blend of typical regional grapes aged up to three years in used wood. It was bottled in October 2018 with 108 grams per liter of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. This has reasonable solidity and structure, but its best feature is the expression of fruit. It has fine flavor and finishes well. It doesn't seem quite as precise or as lifted as some here, but it presents the impression of seriousness rather than simply being a light quaffer. It does thin out a bit with aeration, but that's to be expected in this category.",NV Dow's Trademark Finest Reserve Port,RP 89
416,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The 2016 Vintage Port, bottled in May for release in October  2018, is mostly a 48/31 blend of Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional, with various other grapes and some very old vines for the rest. It comes in with 111 grams of residual sugar. This is a very elegant Dow's, but there is certainly both power and concentration lurking underneath. Adding fine fruit, it is expressive and sophisticated, a very refined offering that seems not quite as burly as in some years. It is still exceptionally appealing, but it was curiously understated when seen. Some bottle shock, perhaps? The fresh 2016 Vintage? This is an illustration of Charles Symington's philosophy, as relayed to me, that the ""wines should be in harmony from the first day."" I don't think this will be a great Dow's, but it is an enjoyable one. If it wakes up, it might be entitled to an uptick. For the moment, between the top blends in the Symington stable, I'd lean to Graham's as the best in this vintage. Both are easily outclassed by the single-plot wines.

It comes in at 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is a relatively big boy on first taste, showing good structure and a mouth-coating demeanor. The delicious flavors, laced with cherry-chocolate and some mint, make it enticing, not just well structured. This is a lovely single-quinta that should age pretty well and still be approachable young. As it sat and aired, it became a bit more mute. It did seem to come around very fast, and it was not quite as impressive as the initial tastes suggested. It is still pretty delicious and it should hold well. This has been released.

418,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The 2015 Quinta do Bomfim, a single-quinta Port, is a field blend coming in at 104 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is a wine that the Symingtons have scheduled for much later release—around 2025. Consider this a preview and a projection. It shows reasonable concentration for the vintage and reasonable power, but little stands out. Laced with dark plums and stonewashed flavors, it finishes dry and serious, with fine persistence. Conversely, it is not quite as vividly flavored as most 2015s. When it is released, it will be showing fairly well, I suspect. While it is nicely structured, the power is moderate for Dow's. In sum, this is lovely, but it should be approachable young and it won't exactly be the best ager Dow has ever produced. Still, it won't disappoint as a late release with undoubtedly attractive pricing. There were 1,000 cases produced.",2015 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
419,Chateau de Fonsalette,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2011 Late Bottled Vintage Port is bottled with a bar top cork and 105 grams per liter of residual sugar. It has reasonable concentration, but bigger aromatics. Sappy and intensely flavorful on the finish, this shows off a bit of muscle, too, but it is fully ready to drink and it shows very well. It's made to drink now. If well stored, it can last, but it's not meant to hold.",2011 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
420,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The 1994 Vintage Port is set for re-release. It has about 92 grams per liter of residual sugar. It's a beauty, with all that Dow power and structure that I've loved over the years--even after some hours of decanting. Intensely concentrated in flavor, without being jammy, this lingers on the gripping finish after starting with a touch of mint. Serious and brooding, it is not yet as complex and as developed as it could be--but this is Port and that will come in time. Be patient. In the meanwhile, if you must crack this now, give it a few hours in a decanter, to state the obvious. This is a terrific Dow's VP that is still growing and improving. It is still about its potential in some ways and it may well exceed expectations. It will certainly acquire even more complexity with more cellaring. Personally, I would try to give it at least another decade in the cellar.",1994 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
421,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta de Senhora Da Ribeira Vintage Port,"The 2013 Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Port comes in with 100 grams per liter of residual sugar and was bottled in May 2015. It is a blend of 35% Touriga Nacional, 40% Touriga Franca, 15% Sousão and 10% Old Vines field blend. Showing very good concentration for the year and beautiful structure, this lovely Single Quinta Port is full in the mouth and very powerful in its youth. The beautiful fruit underneath announces its presence with some intensity--it tastes great, too. Palate coating and inky black, this should exceed expectations over the next couple of decades. After being opened for some five days, it sealed the deal. It became far more expressive, crisper and transparent. It also became remarkably delicious. It showed not a hint of fading or oxidation. It should age well. On the other side of the coin, you can approach it in several years with some decanting, but giving it about ten to 12 years from vintage date would be far better. Time will tell the whole story, but this seems pretty terrific right now and it still seems to have some upside potential as well. Notes: Part of Dow from 1890-1953 and reacquired in 1998, this Quinta is on the Douro's North Bank.

422,Chateau de Fonsalette,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2009 Late Bottled Vintage Port was bottled in 2014 after five years in oak. It comes in with 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. This has settled down since I first saw it. Although it is quite drinkable now, it is still big and burly with some tannic pop on the finish. The restrained sweetness and flavor turns rather complex on the finish. It is an LBV that seems a bit austere and intellectual at times, but that just helps it seem rather serious. It has great fruit, too. Note that this has a bar top cork and was filtered. It is not expected to improve much. It is intended to be drunk young, not aged, although it can certainly hold longer if the cork remains good.",2009 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89

It is a more intellectual Single Quinta than its siblings this issue, but its best features should pay dividends over the long haul in the cellar. Dry and muscular, rather intense and focused, this is not actually quite ready to drink and will certainly benefit more from some cellaring or decanting. The precision and structure here should allow this to age gracefully and acquire more complexity, even if it is ""sort of"" approachable now. It should continue to improve over the next decade, at the least.",2004 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
424,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The Dow 1934 Vintage Port is certainly better than the 1920. For sure, it feels a little muted on the nose compared to the Sandeman '34, yet it opens with scents of clove, sandalwood and a light blackcurrant pastille scents. The palate is well balanced with a pinch of white pepper on the entry, nicely poised with just a hint of oxidation creeping in toward the harmonious finish. But there is something regal in this elegiac Port, a kingly character that has passed its majestic prime and yet is still compelling. Tasted May 2015.",1934 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
425,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The Dow 1920 Vintage Port, shipper unknown but almost definitely English, has a pale tawny/tuile hue. The nose is showing its age, creaking at the seams a little with grilled walnut and wood varnish coming immediately to mind, a little dustiness that recedes with time and reveals a faint minty scent. The palate is medium-bodied with a pleasing weight, a subtle caramel-like sweetness evident toward the finish that feels a little dry and austere, a touch feral compared to the 1920 Warre tasted alongside. I suspect this is simple a Vintage Port that is just long in tooth, yet that signature structure and masculinity of Dow is still present. Tasted May 2015.",1920 Dow's Vintage Port,RP 89
426,Chateau de Fonsalette,Late Bottled Vintage Port,"The 2009 Late Bottled Vintage Port is a filtered blend bottled with a bar top cork in 2014. It was just released in January 2015. It comes in with 98 grams per liter of residual sugar. Wonderfully fresh, sweet and charming on opening, this becomes a surprisingly focused LBV, even though it is easy to drink and does well as a pop 'n' pour. It has rather nice, underlying structure. The tannins are ripe, but there are some, and it has the grip and concentration of flavors on the finish to be interesting as well as tasty. It becomes more brooding and quite drier with aeration. Resampling it made me appreciate it more. A couple of days later, it was drinking far better, having fleshed out while still showing fresh, sappy fruit. Just for fun–since the bar top seems to encourage you to do that and LBVs are pretty resistant–I held it and experimented at Day 4 and Day 9. It was quite enticing on Day 4. On Day 9, it still drank rather well, showing good balance and structure, but there was also a hint of oxidation in the background. Overall, the mid-palate concentration is average for its type and there is little in the way of complexity at its young age–and it is not likely designed to age, even if can to some degree, which tends to give wines like this a ceiling. This is still overall a very nice performance in this big vintage. It is delicious, but also well balanced and intriguing. Enjoy it for what it is while it is young: well crafted, gracefully constructed and awfully tasty.",2009 Dow's Late Bottled Vintage Port,RP 89
427,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The 2012 Senhora da Ribeira has an opaque color. The nose displays a lot of primal sucrose with creme de cassis, iodine and whole bunches of violets, later boysenberry jam – all very precocious and seductive. The palate is sweet on the entry, a soft and sensual fortified that gently builds in the mouth toward a harmonious finish of blackcurrant, black pepper, sage and Chinese five-spice. This is a clever release from this undeclared year. Drink 2018-2030+

428,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The 2011 Dow Vintage Port was made from no less than 44 separate ferments from finest fruit sourced from Quinta do Bomfim (35% of the blend), Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira (42%) and the Santinho (14%) and Cerdeira (6%) estates. Just six of the best lots were used in the final blend, which consists of 40% Touriga Franca, 36% Touriga Nacional, 10% Sousao and 14% of old vine plantings. It has a beautiful, quite extravagant bouquet with copious black and red fruit, Indian spice, and hints of menthol and orange rind that unfold wonderfully in the glass. The palate is a sumptuous affair, one that is beautifully balanced with velvety smooth, plump tannins, copious black fruit with a harmonious, white pepper-tinged finish that is a decadent delight. This is one of the finest of the declarations of 2011 Vintage Ports, a sublime expression of the vintage you would be foolish not to buy. This is Dow at its best. 5,000 cases have been declared. Tasted May 2013.

429,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The nose on the Quinta do Bomfim 2006 is more masculine and reserved than the Quinta da Malvedos 2006 with tertiary/underbrush aromas and introspective dark fruits that demand coaxing. The palate is medium-bodied with very good acidity and certainly not an opulent young quinta, but edgy and tannic towards the masculine finish. It is almost austere compared to its peers and yet with impressive substance and length. Certainly not the most approachable young port, it deserves at least a decade in the cellar. Drink 2020-2045.  Tasted October 2011.

430,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,"The production of Senhora da Ribeira in 2006 was 69 pipes. It has a very rounded, sensual bouquet with touches of raisin, smoke and violets although it does not quite have the delineation on the nose as Symington’s other 2006 Quintas. The palate is well-defined and supple in texture; sedate and very composed, with a delicate, focused, licorice-tinged finish that could just do with more intensity and “thrust.” However, it has superb harmony and purity. Drink 2020-2040. Tasted October 2011. Importer: Premium Port Wines Inc., San Francisco, CA; tel. (415) 554-9920. Due to be released in 2016.",2006 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,RP 89

The palate is very elegant with fine, yet patently sturdy tannins. It is well knit and almost lush in the mouth, with a great crescendo of clove-tinged black fruit towards the finish. This Senhora da Ribeira is very seductive and charming. Drink now-2030.  Tasted October 2011.",1998 Dow's Quinta de Senhora da Ribeira,RP 89
432,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"The Bomfim 1965 has a lifted nose with vestiges of decayed ripe red-berried fruit with touches of balsam, peat and pine needles, but it lacks real complexity and is not as clean as I would like. The palate is medium-bodied with edgy tannins and displays a lot of volatility towards the finish that lacks flesh and length. This is a curiosity at best, although there may be better bottles out there. Past its best. Tasted October 2011.",1965 Dow's Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,RP 89
433,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The 2007 Dow’s Vintage Port is one of the stars of the vintage. A glass-coating opaque purple color, it offers up an already complex bouquet of mineral, pencil lead, licorice, spice box, and assorted black fruits. On the palate it is quite massive, slightly dry in the house style, and packed with fruit. It has the structure to be one of the long distance runners of the vintage taking as much as 20 years to reach its peak and drinking well through 2050.  As an aside, I was able to taste the individual components of this wine on the day prior to this tasting. The final blend is better than any of its parts.

434,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The complex aromatics of the opaque, black-colored 2003 Dow Vintage Port display chocolate, dried oak, black cherries, blackberries, copious spices, and a myriad flowers. This fresh, backward wine offers a medium to full-bodied, deeply concentrated core of spice-laced dark fruits. Softly-textured and seductive in the mid-palate, it boasts abundant layers of candied Damson plums, blueberries, black cherries, molasses, and hints of chocolate before revealing its firm structure. Extremely youthful and primary, this exceptional effort demands patience. Projected maturity: 2025-2045+.

This firmly-structured, classic, tightly-knit, restrained port exhibits brilliant purity as well as impressive intensity. While not the most dramatic or flamboyant, it is a beautiful, classically structured port that will age gracefully. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2030.

437,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"Dow's 1992 Quinta do Bomfim is an expressive, fragrant, up-front style of port with a pungent, peppery, floral, cassis-scented nose, full-bodied, rich, chewy, ripe flavors, light tannin, and sensational extract and length.  The wine explodes on the back of the palate, announcing its considerable richness and intensity.  This port should drink well young, and last for 30 years.

438,Chateau de Fonsalette,Vintage Port,"The firmly-structured, moderately tannic, impressively colored and concentrated 1991 Vintage Port is less precocious and more reserved than the 1992 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port.  It may develop along the lines of the stern but powerful 1977.  The wine offers a classic display of black fruits, licorice, and chocolate aromas and flavors, as well as a full-bodied, muscular style with considerable tannin and firmness.  Give it 10-12 years of cellaring and drink it over the following 30+.

439,Chateau de Fonsalette,Quinta do Bomfim Vintage Port,"I thought this was a staggering example of port.  Dow's style tends to be more backward, but this opaque black/purple-colored wine reveals a huge, powerful, intense palate, with gobs of flesh and viscous fruit.  There is considerable tannin in the finish.  It is a massive port with no indication of excessive alcohol in the finish.  A magnificent young, dry-styled vintage port that just goes on and on in the mouth, it should last for 20-30 years.  The single Quinta ports are just as spectacular as any vintage port I tasted from 1983 or 1985.
