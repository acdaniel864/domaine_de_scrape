0,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The most recent release of this iconic wine is the 2022 Riesling G-Max, which I gave a score of 95+ last year in the summer when I tasted it for the first time in the context of Keller's 2022 Rieslings, when the wine showed up as a concentrated and intense yet still reductive purist. Six months later, not much has changed. The nose is dense, enormously aromatic and fruity and intermingles with yeasty and salty notes. Dense, round and juicy on the palate, with generous, accessible fruit but also a fine, mineral acid structure, this is again a rather slender, elegant and perhaps less dramatic G-Max compared to the 2021 or 2019. It already dries pretty well this young but will reveal its true character only over the next 10 or more years. The wine will be available in May 2024 (for those who are lucky enough to get a bottle or two). Whether it really has the substance and class of the last 10 vintages remains to be seen.

1,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The 2021 Riesling G-Max is another highlight of the history of this mysterious wine. Cool, citrusy, taut and fresh on the nose, with rocky notes and a concentrated but elegant Riesling and yellow stone fruit aroma, this is a juicy, zesty and taut dry Riesling form a coolish and rainier vegetation period. The wine reveals a concentrated core and well-integrated mineral acidity. The 2021 is slender, very fine and enormously animating G-Max that I tasted blind as wine number 21 of the G-Max vertical at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2021 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
2,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind as wine number 18 and right after the 2018 in the G-Max vertical tasting in Germany, Keller's 2020 Riesling G-Max is very clear, fresh, puristic, firm and concentrated on the nose, with aromas of salted lemons and phenolic notes. Very elegant and defined on the palate, this is a full-bodied, dense, salty but also elegant and even delicate and pure Riesling that develops a great, very long finish. This is a classical G-Max like the 2012 that should gain in expression and finesse over the coming years. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2020 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
3,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"In this context (20+ years of G-Max) and tasted blind as wine number 20, the still embryonic 2019 Riesling G-Max shows clear, bright, fine and elegant Riesling fruit in a classic style with saline notes in the background. Dense, saline and spicy yet also juicy on the palate but without any hint of mass or power, the 2019 already sings, plays and laughs, yet it also reveals plenty of tension. It is a true classic with unusual finesse for the G-Max and possibly the beginning of a new style with more purity, finesse and precision? Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2019 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
4,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"From a vintage with a very warm and extremely dry summer, Keller's 2018 Riesling G-Max is clear, very dense and slightly phenolic on the nose that quotes citrus notes and ripe, concentrated stone fruit aromas. Juicy and very dense or even massive in its firm structure but also provided with fine mineral acidity, the 2018 G-Max develops an enormously salty, long-lasting finish but remains an embryonic dry Riesling with the structure of a Clos-Ste-Hune from Trimbach and probably also its life expectancy. Tasted blind as wine number 17 of the Keller vertical, right after the 2016 vintage at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2018 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
5,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Keller's 2017 Riesling G-Max shows a clear nose with ripe, concentrated fruit and saline notes of crushed rocks and already indicates a fine tannin quality. Elegant and juicy on the palate, this is a very dense and firmly structured dry Riesling with concentrated fruit and a still somewhat phenolic structure that is even astringent on the finish. It has a currently slightly untamed character that is reminiscent of game. It is still inaccessible but a promising G-Max with power and structure that needs a lot of patience (or another decade in the bottle).

6,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The 2016 Riesling G-Max opens with an enormously wild nose with untamed notes and tobacco aromas as well as intense, dense and fleshy fruit that intermingles with iodine notes. Rich and elegant on the first palate, the 2016 quickly turns to a younger, slimmer and fresher Riesling and becomes taut, firm and salty toward the finish. From a vintage that saw an extremely wet spring but a dry and hot summer, the 2016 develops very good length and intensity but is still a young wine that shall better be forgotten for a while. Tasted blind as wine number 16 of the G-Max vertical at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2016 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
7,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind and following the 2013 and 2014 vintages, the 2015 Riesling G-Max is clear, elegant, quite cool, tart and stony on the nose that is reminiscent of apricots, crushed rocks and salts. Rich and juicy as well as fresh, spicy and salty on the palate, the 2015 G-Max develops great length and reveals a classic expression, combining its intense fruit with a firm structure and persistent saltiness. This dry Riesling from very old vines remains on the palate for a very long time and still has superb aging potential. After 2002 and 2003, the 2015 is another stellar vintage for Keller's G-Max and is still very young.

8,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind as the 14th wine of the vertical and right after the 2013 vintage, Keller's 2014 Riesling G-Max opens with a clean, fine and rather classic nose with ripe, cooked and concentrated fruit aromas with phenolic spice. Slightly untamed and animal on the palate, this is a taut, fresh, persistently salty, straightforward and enormously mineral as well as elegant G-Max with great and complex length. This is more than just a remarkable Riesling for this difficult vintage when, after a warm summer, rainfalls caused a stop-and-go harvest in many German wine regions. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2014 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
9,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Keller's 2013 Riesling G-Max opens with a cool, very clear, pure and stony nose with light stone fruit aromas intertwined with almost smoky notes. Rich, dense and intense on the palate, this is an almost powerful but also enormously salty and still youthful dry Riesling that is still somewhat loud and overwhelming to the senses but should further refine over the coming years (or with sufficient aeration). The 2013 is still evolving, even more than 10 years after the fermentation. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2013 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
10,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind, Keller's 2012 Riesling G-Max is the fourth wine of the vertical tasting, following the warm vintages of 2005, 2007 and 2009. The wine opens with clear, ripe, slightly warm and even creamy fruit with citrus aromas and stony nuances as well as still reductive phenolic notes. Elegant, juicy and spicy on the palate, with fine salinity yet without the power and sustainability of the first three Rieslings, Keller's 2012 G-Max embodies a rather classic, middle-aged style that should not be underestimated. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2012 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
11,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind after the 2006 vintage as wine number 7 of the vertical tasting, Keller's 2011 Riesling G-Max opens clear, fresh and stony on the slightly animal as well as phenolic and still underdeveloped or overall restrained and rather cool nose. Juicy, dense and vital on the elegant palate but also quite ripe and very slightly draining on the citrusy finish, the 2006 seems a little too ambitious and exaggerated in the overly forced structure. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2011 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
12,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"From a coolish, often rainy and late-ripening vintage, the 2010 Riesling G-Max shows ripe and dense fruit aromas on the spicy and generally elegant nose that is reminiscent of preserved stone fruits. Juicy, round and elegant as well as dense and powerful on the somewhat sweetish or even striking palate and with a slightly drying, tannic finish despite its richness, this is one of the less exciting yet still impressive G-Max vintages of the first 22 years. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2010 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
13,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Tasted as the third wine in this blind tasting, Keller's 2009 Riesling G-Max shows a very clear, elegant, aromatic bouquet with stone fruit aromas intertwined with refreshing notes of Amalfi lemons, broken rocks and salt. Quite sunny and ripe in its fruit expression, it is fresh and juicy on the very aromatic and really fruity palate that bears a certain resemblance to the 2005 G-Max yet with herbal nuances. Rich, elegant as well as firm, persistent and salty on the palate, the 2009 is based on ripe and concentrated fruit and structured by fine tannins. It is taut in style but powerful, dense and energetic and develops great length. It is much better than I would have expected. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2009 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
14,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Served blind after the cool 2004 vintage, Keller's 2008 Riesling G-Max shows a clear, fresh, complex and still very young bouquet of ripe fruit and herbal notes. Rich, spicy and enormously juicy on the palate, this is a classic, dense and fruit-intensive wine, yet it is a rather lean and firmly structured Riesling classic with fleshy fruit and pleasant astringency on the finish. This is a very excellent Riesling from a cool, rather damp and humid year with a very high yield, in which the really great wines were naturally in short supply. However, the G-Max can certainly lay claim to being a reference wine of the vintage. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2008 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
15,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The 2007 Riesling G-Max came as the second wine in this blind tasting after the luscious 2005. It is cool, fresh and very precise on the nose with aromas of stone fruit, crushed rocks and spicy as well as salty/mineral notes. Elegant on the palate, it is very juicy but also spicy and very salty. More classic than the 2005, the 2007 develops impressively dense, spicy and savory as well as complex length. It is an expressive Riesling that is likely to be one of the best of the vintage. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2007 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
16,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The 2006 Riesling G-Max was served blind after the 2003 as the sixth wine of the G-Max vertical. It is clear, with rather cool and slightly smoky fruit as well as herbal and citric notes and those of pencil tips. Dense, juicy and spicy, with a fine tannin structure on the palate, this 2006 shows the first nuances of age but structurally remains a taut, even quite youthful G-Max. There are not that many dry 2006 Rieslings of this class in Germany after rainfalls had met warm temperatures in early October after a beautiful summer that let the grapes ripen early. The resulting thin skins were very vulnerable for the onset of botrytis that, in the end, forced the producers to a very speedy but super selective harvest. There were only a very few great dry 2006 Rieslings produced in Germany that year, and Keller's G-Max is one of them.

17,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Keller's intensely yellow colored 2005 Riesling G-Max opened the tasting at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in January 2024. The wine opens with ripe and juicy fruit on the rich nose that also reveals fine spices. Elegant and juicy on the palate, this is a dense and rich yet also fine dry Riesling with tropical fruit and an enormously aromatic but also salty finish. This G-Max, only the fifth ever, shows great length and is an impressive, still very fruity and mouth-filling Riesling with almost infinite potential. A wine for hedonists. Tasted blind.",2005 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
18,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"The 2004 Riesling G-Max was the 10th wine of the vertical tasting and followed the 2002 vintage in a flight with rather coolish vintages. It is herbal and delicately nutty, with almond notes on the nose yet less pronounced despite the firmer, concentrated fruit. This 2004 is characterized more by the soil than the sun. Slender on the palate but also dense and rich and even slightly sweetish, this G-Max is somewhat bitter and astringent on the finish but has nevertheless impressed some of my fellow tasters, including Klaus Peter Keller. I still remain rather reserved toward the 2004 from the outset. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2004 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
19,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Keller's 2003 Riesling G-Max is a legendary wine from a historic vintage that has been as warm as any vintage before. Served as the fifth wine of the vertical, the 2003 indicates very ripe and concentrated fruit on the intense nose that is almost cooked but also shows fine rocky notes. Fresh, vital and salty on the very savory palate, this is a dense, enormously rich, complex and also complete Riesling that appears ageless and develops spectacular length. This is an unexpected great, multi-layered G-Max from an often underestimated vintage. How did one of the doyens of German Riesling comment on the 2003? Helmut Dönnhoff said, ""You should never underestimate maturity. There is no substitute for it."" And Egon Müller, who served me a 1959 Auslese and a 1976 to accompany his 2003 Scharzhofbergers once, said, ""In view of our experience with hot vintages, I'm not worried about the development of our 2003s."" Keller's G-Max is further proof of the quality of the 2003s from the very best producers.

20,Keller,Riesling G-Max,"Keller's 2002 Riesling G-Max was served as ninth wine in this blind vertical tasting and followed the 2011 vintage. From the first decade, this is the greatest vintage next to the completely different but also fascinating 2003. It has clear, ripe, very sunny but dense fruit with a fine saline note and tannin structure already on the nose. Vital and fresh on the palate, this is a firm, very youthful and enormously salty G-Max with a spicy citrus note. In comparison, it is a rather intellectual Riesling with a taut, still young character. This G-Max is a reminder of how great the 2002 vintage was for German Riesling in general. Of all the vintages, this is perhaps the most exciting G-Max at the moment, even if the 2019, for example, may be the slightly greater Riesling over the long haul. Tasted at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, in January 2024.",2002 Weingut Keller Riesling G-Max,RP 95+
21,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Max,"Keller's 2000 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Max is another forerunner of the G-Max, which was released for the first time as the 2001 vintage—although that one unfortunately wasn't part of the vertical tasting in January this year, where a private collector sponsored the vintages 2002 to 2021 and Keller himself brought the 2022. The Hubacker Max is fresh, very clear and firm on the nose that reveals lime and lemon aromas. Juicy, supple and round on the palate, this is a somewhat astringent-finishing and less precise or defined Riesling, especially when compared to the the amazing 1999 Hubacker G from magnum. The salty finish recites the limestone of the (now Upper) Hubacker site, which is a Keller monopole. Tasted at the Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in late January 2024.",2000 Weingut Keller Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Max,RP 95+
22,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling G,"Keller's 1999 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling G is a kind of forerunner of the G-Max and was served from magnum as wine number 23 or rather as an encore of the historical G-Max vertical at Steinheuer's Restaurant Zur Alten Post in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in late January 2024. The wine shows a cloudy lemon-yellow color and a fabulous, concentrated yet fresh nose reminiscent of citrus fruits and limestone. On the palate, this is a juicy, elegant and round dry Riesling that is not super dry but rich and full-bodied as well as spicy. It's long on the aftertaste and still incredibly young.",1999 Weingut Keller Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling G,RP 95+
23,Keller,Riesling Westhofener Morstein GG Alte Reben,"From 60- to 70-year-old vines, the rare 2022 Riesling Westhofener Morstein GG Alte Reben shows a clear and finely chalky bouquet with delicate but juicy fruit and a touch of exoticism but also citrus notes. Dense, juicy and fine on the palate, with delicate salinity and persistent finesse, this is a great, calm, relaxed Morstein Riesling that is not showy but radiantly confident. Tasted at the domaine July 2023.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Westhofener Morstein GG Alte Reben,RP 95+
24,Keller,Riesling Abts E GG,"The 2022 Riesling Abts E GG is currently probably the most impressive Riesling in the Keller family. As always, the Abtserde is extremely pure, dense and chalky, with fine spiciness reminiscent of great Chablis, but then it shows almost explosive fruit of ripe, concentrated pineapple with citrus freshness. Full-bodied and dense, but also pure, enormously chalky and salty, this is a fine, mineral and long-lasting Riesling from a single vineyard in the Westhofener Brunnenhäuschen. It's a great Riesling with very fine tannins and stimulating salinity and full of tension.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Abts E GG,RP 95+
25,Keller,Riesling Niersteiner Pettenthal GG,"Keller's 2022 Riesling Niersteiner Pettenthal GG, grown on barren soil, is very dense and intense, ripe and concentrated on the somewhat reductive, sun-cooked nose, which is clearly warmer than that of the Hipping. On the palate, however, this is a salty Riesling with racy acid freshness, fine tannins and the finesse of the Pettenthal terroir, with an intense and juicy but never alcoholic or even bitter finish. The wine actually remains slender and needs more time to fully develop. Whereas the Hipping is already drinking well now, the Pettenthal needs a good 5 years.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Niersteiner Pettenthal GG,RP 95+
26,Keller,Sylvaner vom Austernfels,"Keller's fascinatingly clear, mineral 2022 Sylvaner vom Austernfels is one of the greatest of its kind in the German- and French-speaking world. It grows in Neubamberger Heerkretz, which was still called Schlossberg until 1971, and lies just below the church, which stands on the highest point. The volcanic soil of this site, which is rhyolite, with fossilized oysters from the Mainz Basin on top, makes it easy to mistake this Rhine-Hessian wine for one from the Nahe. Slightly reductive on the nose (hazelnut, light fruit, honeydew melon, flowers), it is a dense, firm, racy, enormously mineral and persistently salty vin de terroir with great complexity, elegance and tension on the palate. A great, grippy terroir wine that doesn't need the grape variety to be named, that's how much the site shines through here. 13% alcohol.",2022 Weingut Keller Sylvaner vom Austernfels,RP 95+
27,Keller,Riesling Dalsheimer Oberer Hubacker GG,"The 2022 Riesling Dalsheimer Oberer Hubacker GG is very clear and reductive in its dense, aromatic and slightly salty nose, which combines fresh pineapple, delicate citrus fruit and fine herbal aromas. Juicy and intense on the palate yet fine and elegant, with delicate salinity and fine tannin structure as well as good length, this is one of Keller's finest Hubackers of the last 20 years, but it still needs some time to develop. Tasted at the domaine in July this year.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Dalsheimer Oberer Hubacker GG,RP 95+
28,Keller,Riesling Westhofener Kirchspiel GG,"Keller's 2022 Riesling Westhofener Kirchspiel GG opens with a clear, elegant, dense and chalky nose with a ripe, intense fruit and notes reminiscent of iodine. Elegant, dense and chalky on the palate, with an intense, tightly woven and salty-savory finish, this is an excellent finessed Kirchspiel and very typical for its terroir.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Westhofener Kirchspiel GG,RP 95+
29,Keller,Sylvaner Feuervogel,"The 2022 Sylvaner Feuervogel comes from 60-year-old vines on the lighter (brighter) limestone soils in the Steingrube. It has a deep, pure, salty-spicy nose and continues this impression on the palate. Puristic and fresh, bright, clear and grippy, this is completely characterized by limestone and is enormously stimulating on the salty finish. It is a promising, still discreet but already vibrant Sylvaner that needs a little time. 12.5% stated alcohol.",2022 Weingut Keller Sylvaner Feuervogel,RP 95+
30,Keller,Riesling Niersteiner Hipping GG,"The 2022 Riesling Niersteiner Hipping GG opens with clear, deep, elegant and delicately spicy fruit that is still slightly reductive but ripe and concentrated. This is dense, firm and juicy on the palate, with good fruit intensity and phenolic structure. The acidity is fine, fresh and salty, and the finish is long and intense. It's an impressive Riesling from the heat of the red slope.",2022 Weingut Keller Riesling Niersteiner Hipping GG,RP 95+
31,Keller,Sylvaner Westhofen,"The 2022 Sylvaner Westhofen is a remarkably expressive wine of this old variety, which enjoys great popularity at Keller and is, so to speak, the family's answer to the Aligoté in Burgundy or the somewhat milder alternative to the always racy Riesling. The wine comes from just below the Absterde Vineyard, from the Steingrube Dautensatz, where it grows on partly reddish-colored limestone. Matured in 700-liter barrels and bottled in June of this year, this Sylvaner also shows bright but currently intense fruit with notes of ripe, yellow pears but also cool, mineral notes thanks to 45-year-old vines and the good water-retention capacity of the soil. On the palate, this traditional Westhofen wine is juicy, enormously complex and grippy, with stimulating salinity on the finish. A really excellent Sylvaner! 12.5% stated alcohol.",2022 Weingut Keller Sylvaner Westhofen,RP 95+
32,Keller,Spätburgunder Rosé – FR –,"Keller's 2022 Spätburgunder Rosé – FR – was produced using the saignée method ""from the best Pinot grapes"" of the Frauenberg. It is a salmon-colored rosé with intense and fine (red) fruit and delicate mocha notes.

33,Keller,Grüner Silvaner,"The 2022 Grüner Silvaner comes from the ""premier cru"" vineyards in the Westhofen Steingrube site and from 40-year-old vines.

34,Keller,Spätburgunder Westhofener Morstein GG,"Fermented with 85% to 90% whole grapes from vines more than 80 years old, some of which have been grafted onto limestone soils with a heavy clay layer, the 2021 Spätburgunder Westhofener Morstein GG opens with a deep, smoky nose of juicy cherries and cassis with fine spice and floral notes. This is very fine and elegant wine. On the palate, this has a silky-juicy texture, which is gentle and elegant thanks to the very delicate tannins, and it combines skillfully with the mineral acidity. The finish, on the other hand, is stimulatingly salty and indicates one of the most complex red wines from Rheinhessen. No known release date yet, but the 2019 has just hit the shelves. 12.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork.

This is accompanied by fine phenolic and rather dark spice notes with delicate smoke and toast aromas. It's juicy and elegant on the palate, with fine mineral freshness and supporting tannins. Coming from a rather cool, rainy year, this young Pinot is still quite tart, firm and concentrated, but it shows great potential. 12.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork.

Bottled unfiltered in May, the wine already shows a certain yeast complexity on the nose. On the palate, it is generous in its juicy fruit but also fine and silky, with delicate tannin spice and a dense finish, which is still somewhat characterized by nougat and mocha. Intense and slow, never heavy, this is a great Bürgel that was extracted gently with hands and feet. 12.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork.

37,Keller,Spätburgunder Réserve de Fils,"From 15-year-old vines in the Am Schwarzen Herrgott in the Zellertal, the 2021 Spätburgunder Réserve de Fils fermented with 100% whole clusters and shows cool, finely concentrated berry fruit with lime and cassis notes. This is silky and juicy on the palate, very elegant and fresh, with an animatingly salty and almost spicy finish, yet it's balanced and rather lean with great complexity and energy. This Herrgott is also, like the sparkling wine futures, clearly characterized by the cool terroir of the lime-rich site and has a correspondingly cool and fresh appearance, but it is nevertheless ripe. The wine should develop its true depth with time in the bottle. By the way, the 2022 will be released as Grosses Gewächs (GG). 12.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork.

Aged for 15 months in two Burgundy pièces (30% new), then in stainless steel until bottling, this unfiltered white shows a very clear, fine but also intense bouquet of ripe fruit with chalky and herbal notes but also mocha aromas. Dense, intense and complex on the palate, this is a fresh, energetic and persistently salty Chardonnay with a fine tannin structure and stimulating salinity. It's long lasting and dense. Tasted at the domaine this summer.",2021 Weingut Keller Chardonnay Réserve du Fils,RP 95+
39,Keller,Am Schwarzen Herrgott Chardonnay Sekt,"Only 600 bottles are currently sur lattes of the 2020 Am Schwarzen Herrgott Chardonnay Sekt. They will be disgorged most probably as brut nature sometime between next year and 2027 at the earliest. This inaugural sparkling wine shows a deep, intense, fresh and complex but also perfectly ripe Chardonnay nose with notes of mocha, hazelnut and iodine. Mouthfillingly rich but also pure on the palate, with fine phenolics and grippy structure, this is already a stimulatingly salty, hugely promising sparkling wine that takes the warm vintage to an astonishing level.

40,Keller,Am Schwarzen Herrgott Pinot Noir Sekt,"The base wine of the 2019 Am Schwarzen Herrgott Pinot Noir sparkling wine matured for nine months in oak barrels and has been maturing in the bottle ever since. It has a dense, fresh, chalky nose with depth and power as well as fine reduction and some burnt rubber and citric notes. Enormously puristic and characterized by the Herrgott cru (literally: Lord God), it has fine notes of redcurrants, cherries and a hint of mocha. Dense and elegant on the palate yet very clear and fresh, again all Lord God. Enormously salty, complex and fresh, yet straightforward and grippy, this is a promising raw sparkling wine, of which 600 bottles are sur lattes. Release date: 2027 or 2028. Tasted at the domaine this summer for all those who cannot get enough Keller wine.",2019 Weingut Keller Am Schwarzen Herrgott Pinot Noir Sekt,RP 95+
41,Keller,Rosé Prestige Brut Nature,"One of the two very first sparkling releases from Felix Keller, the 2018 Rosé Prestige Brut Nature is an assemblage of 60% Pinot Noir from the Am Schwarzen Herrgott and 40% Chardonnay from the same enormous calcareous cru. Aged in used barriques (five to 10 years old) for nine months and disgorged in March this year without adding any dosage, this sparkling wine shows a medium-intense salmon-pink color and a clear, fresh, chalky nose with fine red berry fruit (raspberries, redcurrants) and a hint of cherries. It is a light, fine-bodied and puristic yet stimulatingly fresh sparkling wine with fine grip. Now available in selected top restaurants.",2018 Weingut Keller Rosé Prestige Brut Nature,RP 95+
42,Keller,Grande Cuvée No. 001 Brut Nature,"The NV Grande Cuvée No. 001 Brut Nature is based on the 2019 harvest and blends 20% Pinot Meunier and 30% Pinot Noir with 50% Chardonnay, predominantly from the chalk-rich Am Schwarzen Herrgott vineyard but also with grapes from the Frauenberg and Bürgel, two prestigious Pinot vineyards in Rheinhessen. Pressed on the basket press and matured in two used barriques, the first Grande Cuvée from the house, which is particularly famous for its dry Rieslings, shows clear, subtle and fresh as well as multilayered fruit with a hint of mocha and brioche. Concentrated, dense and complex on the palate yet light and citrusy fresh, with stimulating phenolics and lingering salinity, this is an amazing first sparkling wine from Felix Keller, combining elegance, freshness and purity with structure and complexity. Very stimulating, but also dense. Great sparkling wine! To be released next year in spring.",NV Weingut Keller Grande Cuvée No. 001 Brut Nature,RP 95+
43,Keller,Kirchspiel Riesling Spätlese R,"The golden-yellow 2007 Kirchspiel Riesling Spätlese R offers an intense, caramelly, slightly phenolic bouquet of ripe and matured fruits and a fine, slightly flinty tone that indicates maturity. Full-bodied, rich and round on the palate, this is a sweet but also savory and saline Kirchspiel Spätlese with some bitter tannins on the saline, firm, slightly bitter and phenolic finish. It is quite sweet and mouthfilling yet not as stimulating as a great Spätlese. No counter bottle. Possibly corked? 13% stated alcohol. Natural cork. Tasted in  June 2023.",2007 Weingut Keller Kirchspiel Riesling Spätlese R,RP 95+

Full-bodied, intense and fleshy on the palate, with ripe, elegant fruit and grippy tannins, this is a generous, textured and silky Pinot from limestone soils that reveals fine, vivacious acidity with still grippy and saline phenols. A Pinot with soul that will reveal its real class after some years in the bottle. 12.5% stated alcohol. Tasted in Wiesbaden, August 2022.",2020 Weingut Keller Nieder-Flörsheim Frauenberg Rheinhessen Spätburgunder GG,RP 95+
45,Keller,Schubertslay Riesling Kabinett Alte Reben,"Keller's 2020 Schubertslay Riesling Kabinett Alte Reben is very clear and fine on the bright and delicately spicy nose that represents perfect fruit ripeness. Juicy, silky and enormously vital on the palate, this is a dense, pure and intense, very sustainable yet also fine and fruity style of Riesling from ancient, ungrafted vines in Piesport/Mosel. Great style and a great wine that will be auctioned in November this year. Tasted in Wiesbaden in August 2021.",2020 Weingut Keller Schubertslay Riesling Kabinett Alte Reben,RP 95+

47,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,"Keller’s 2019 Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix is deep, pure and elegant on the fine but intense nose that shows fine reduction and an iodine note. Juicy, round and intense on the palate, with remarkably fine tannins and a long and sustainable finish, this is a very complex and persistent Pinot that will shine even brighter after some years of bottle age and once the reduction has been lessened. Tasted in Wiesbaden in August 2021.",2019 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,RP 95+
48,Keller,Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,"Keller’s 2019 Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG is even a bit more reductive than the Morstein and displays a tart cherry aroma but remains still discreet in its bouquet. Silky, fresh and vital on the palate, this is a concentrated, tight and sustainable but also juicy and salty Pinot that will need some years of bottle age to shine. Tasted in Wiesbaden in August 2021.",2019 Weingut Keller Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,RP 95+
49,Keller,Abts E(rde) Riesling GG,"Grown only 200 meters away from the old-vines Morstein, the 2019 Abts E(rde) Riesling GG combines perfect fruit ripeness with delicate concentration as well as notes of chalk, flint and iron. There is a similarity to both Kirchspiel (minty, herbal and chalky notes) and Morstein (transcendency), but this has unique ripeness and concentration of fruit, with shredded lemon rind and unique finesse. Round and juicy on the palate, this is a supple and intense yet delicate and silky Riesling with a firm structure built by very fine tannins and remarkably fine acidity. There is this slushy chalkiness combined with lemon oil typical for this terroir. The finish is highly intense and long.",2019 Weingut Keller Abts E(rde) Riesling GG,RP 95+
50,Keller,Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben,"Keller's 2019 Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben is one of the finest dry Rieslings of the vintage. From 75-year-old vines and aged in a 1,000-liter oak vat, this iconic Morstein opens with a very clear, lemony and chalky bouquet along with floral notes and perfectly ripe and concentrated yet still coolish fruit aromas. Full of finesse, mineral vitality and tension, this is a very intense and complex Riesling that develops spectacular length, which is carried onward by a fascinating, razor-sharp and steely, iron-coin, crystalline acidity. After a while in the glass, the wine sheds notes of orange blossoms and Muscat, along with honey flavors and Mediterranean herbal aromas. The yeasty layers are so delicate, like if this were Champagne. The finish is endless. What a noble dry Riesling!",2019 Weingut Keller Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben,RP 99
51,Keller,Hubacker Riesling GG,"From yellow-colored limestone soils in Keller's monopole since 1789, the 2019 Hubacker Riesling GG opens pure, flinty and spicy on the very intense yet refined nose with lemon, herbal and yeasty tones. This is pure, vital or almost racy on the palate, which is an excellent counterpoint to the suppleness and richness of this Hubacker that displays mandarin and white peach aromas. The wine is silky, fresh and juicy but also enormously mineral and tensioned, with impressive grip and length. I have never had a Hubacker at such a high level.",2019 Weingut Keller Hubacker Riesling GG,RP 99
52,Keller,Sylvaner Feuervogel Réserve,"Keller's 2019 Sylvaner Feuervogel Réserve is one of the finest Sylvaners I have tasted in my life—and there are at least hundreds of Sylvaners!  Sourced from 60-year-old vines rooting deep in the refreshing limestone terroir of the Kirchspiel, the wine opens with a deep, highly aromatic, clear, precise and flinty bouquet that builds a complex aromatic composition of stones and orchards. Enormously complex and mineral on the palate, this is a compact wine knit to dramatic tension and sustainable salinity. Great grip and energy here. This is Rheinhessen's (or Germany's?) one and only Sylvaner Grand Cru. It was auctioned in September last year.",2019 Weingut Keller Sylvaner Feuervogel Réserve,RP 99
53,Keller,Westhofen Riesling,"Keller's 2019 Westhofen Riesling is from vines at least 50 years old and offers a fascinating, refined and elegant nose of chalk, blossoms, herbs and stones.

This is a perfectly reductive, pleasantly grippy, elegant, precise and energetic Riesling of exceptional class.",2019 Weingut Keller Westhofen Riesling,RP 99
54,Keller,Kirchspiel Riesling GG,"Keller's 2019 Kirchspiel Riesling GG opens puristic and chalky on the nose with lemon oil and woodruff aromas. Juicy, round and rich on the palate, with smooth suppleness, fine tannins and a stimulating kick on the finish, this is a less puristic but juicy and intense Riesling of great class.",2019 Weingut Keller Kirchspiel Riesling GG,RP 99
55,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG Alte Reben Felix,"Keller's 2018 Morstein Spätburgunder GG Alte Reben Felix is a fascinating rarity of which only two barrels have been made. Partly destemmed by hand yet vinified with 50% whole clusters, the wine opens with deep, fascinating, intense and spicy, highly finessed and elegant fruit that is reminiscent of black cherries, dark and red berries. Concentrated but structured and very intense on the palate, with a thrilling vitality and refreshing grip, this is an elegant, silky, juicy, pure and salty Pinot with sustainable grip and tension and a very intense and complex finish that indicates marvelous aging potential. Weightless intensity and length—absolutely fascinating.",2018 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG Alte Reben Felix,RP 99
56,Keller,Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,"Keller's 2018 Bürgel Spätburgunder GG is a fascinating Burgundian Pinot with a dark and spicy, very elegant and refined yet deep, concentrated and mineral bouquet with some underwood notes. Silky textured, highly finessed and again with some horse stable notes on the palate, this is a tightly structured, very intense and sustainable Pinot with great finesse and an incredibly long, compact and tensioned finish. There is an Islay Whisky (or iodine) note on the finish. Even though the wine is still shy and closed, this is a fantastic Pinot Noir from Germany and by far the best I have tasted from KPK so far (yet I have to admit I missed the 2017). Grand Cru level for sure. Tasted in Wiesbaden in August 2020 next to Huber and with Fürst's incredibly good Hundsrück in mind.",2018 Weingut Keller Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,RP 99
57,Keller,Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,"Keller's 2018 Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG comes along with just 12.3% alcohol and a concentrated, fascinatingly seductive, open and generous yet refined and floral bouquet of red and black currants, cherries and weathered limestones or even chalky aromas. Everything here is perfectly interwoven, precise, highly refined yet also intense. From vines roughly 30 years old and vinified with 50% whole clusters, the wine reveals a lean, fresh and elegant texture with silky tannins and a salivating purity. Cool as silk and full of finesse, with refreshing and spicy tannins that gave a tangy finish, this is a very elegant Frauenberg and arguably one of the finest made here.",2018 Weingut Keller Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,RP 99
58,Keller,Spätburgunder S,"Keller's 2018 Spätburgunder S is a blend of the fruit from vines less than 30 years old that are cultivated in the top sites of Bürgel, Morstein and Frauenberg. The purple-colored wine opens with a pretty deep, elegant and spicy bouquet with cherry aromas. Silky, round and intense on the palate, with red berry and cherry flavors, firm yet fine tannins and a refreshing character, this is a lean and pure yet also intense and sustainable Pinot with a refreshing tangy finish due to the 25% whole clusters used during the cuvaison. Bottled without fining or filtration in July 2019.",2018 Weingut Keller Spätburgunder S,RP 99
59,Keller,Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,"KP Keller's 2017 Bürgel Spätburgunder GG offers beautifully fragrant, pure and fresh Pinot fruit with concentrated red berry and cherry aromas and good mineral depth on the nose, whereas there are no toasty aromas anymore, something I often found too loud in former vintages. The 2017, however, is deep and pure and fabulous in its shining fruit aromas. On the palate, this is an intense and firm, well-structured Pinot with a silky-elegant texture and fine limestone tannins. The finish is concentrated, very long and fresh, with a stimulating kick of concentrated fruits, crunchy phenols and ripe but biting tannins. It's a truly excellent wine and, if the price is realistic, a wine to buy. Tasted in Wiesbaden in August 2019.",2017 Weingut Keller Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,RP 99
60,Keller,Silvaner Feuervogel,"Klaus Peter Keller's 2013 Silvaner Feuervogel opens with a clear, bright, fresh and spicy bouquet of white seed and lush yellow stone fruits as well as candied oranges and crushed limestones, indicating salinity and a certain amount of time of skin maceration and phenol extraction, which gives this Feuervogel (which translates as ""fire bird"") a distinctive but elegant and pure character. Lush and round on the delicate palate, with caramel flavors first but then lingering salinity and vitality, this is a very elegant and delicate yet full-bodied Sylvaner with grip and good tension on the finish. This is an excellent, gastronomic wine that is absolutely stable and vital after six years, and it should age very well over the decade ahead of us. Generous aeration is highly recommended, if you prefer to drink it at this stage. Tasted from my private cellar in January 2020.",2013 Weingut Keller Silvaner Feuervogel,RP 99
61,Keller,Pettenthal Riesling GG (Auction),"The 2016 Pettenthal Riesling GG (Auction) is clear, deep, pure and spicy on the nose, very intense and smoky. On the palate, this is a lush and juicy, intense yet pure, fresh and firmly structured grand cru that was pressed very slowly for more than two days. It is very straight, tight and salty, provided with fine tannins and an impressively powerful, intense and persistent finish. This is a great dry Pettenthal that I’d like to taste a few years from now.",2016 Weingut Keller Pettenthal Riesling GG (Auction),RP 99
62,Keller,Morstein Riesling GG,"The 2016 Morstein Riesling GG is deep and mineral on the nose, still pretty reductive and almost leathery but ripe, concentrated and intense. On the palate, this is a powerful, pure and tannic Riesling with good grip, fine tannins and lots of salt. Great tension and very powerful. This promising wine needs some years to show its class. It's rare so if you see the bottle in a restaurant, just buy it to store instead of drink or, even better, order two, one for now, the other for later.",2016 Weingut Keller Morstein Riesling GG,RP 99
63,Keller,Abts E(rde) Riesling GG,"The 2016 Abts E(rde) Riesling GG is clear, intense and chalky on the concentrated, ripe and juicy nose.

Great concentration, juiciness and lingering salinity, with great grip and tension. An impressive wine!",2016 Weingut Keller Kirchspiel Riesling GG,RP 99
65,Keller,Nierstein Riesling,"The 2016 Nierstein Riesling is sourced almost entirely from the lower 25 meters of the Pettenthal grand cru, with its deeper soils. The wine opens pretty reductive on the nose but is ripe and pure. This is a 12% alcohol, zero sugar Riesling with remarkable grip, finesse and lush fruit. It is pure but juicy and piquant, well structured with fine tannins.  A very promising Riesling that will be on the market only next year.",2016 Weingut Keller Nierstein Riesling,RP 99
66,Keller,Westhofener Riesling,"From a plot that was part of the Morstein GG until 2012, the slowly pressed 2016 Westhofener Riesling is still reductive and untamed but also pretty clear on the nose. Fermented and aged in 1,000-liter Mosel Fuders, this is an incredibly pure, tight, grippy/phenolic, intense, juicy and age-worthy wine!",2016 Weingut Keller Westhofener Riesling,RP 99
67,Keller,Silvaner Feuervogel,"The 2016 Silvaner Feuervogel is pure and mineral on the nose but rich and intense on the palate.

68,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"The 2016 Riesling Von Der Fels is from up to 25-year-old vines in the Kirchspiel, Hubacker and Abtserde. Its bouquet is clear, super ripe and fresh as well as intense and calcareous. On the plate this is a pure and fresh old-school Riesling with a lot of grip and tension. Very chalky, terribly young but promising. Needs time.",2016 Weingut Keller Riesling Von Der Fels,RP 99
69,Keller,Scheurebe Trocken,"The 2016 Scheurebe Trocken is clear, fresh and spicy on the nose, showing very aromatic passionfruit aromas. This is a clear, straight and juicy Scheurebe with round, aromatic fruit and a stimulating finish. Yum yum!",2016 Weingut Keller Scheurebe Trocken,RP 99
70,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,"From old Sylvaner vines that were grafted with Pinot Noir in 2009, the 2015 Morstein Spätburgunder GG ""Felix"" is warmer on the nose than the Frauenberg but also more generous. The bouquet offers a pure, fine, aromatic, generous and charming bouquet with mushroom and forest aromas. On the palate, this is a full-bodied, round, very intense, powerful and persistent German Spätburgunder with fine juicy tannins, gorgeous intensity and persistent power. Although I prefer the finesse, freshness and purity of the Frauenberg in 2015 (at least in this moment), the Morstein is a fascinating Pinot Noir as well and it was produced with the highest percentage of whole bunches. It is very intense, juicy and powerful and shows remarkable finesse and aging potential. The fruit, however, is pretty ripe and concentrated. The rich and powerful Morstein giant goes onto the market only in 2018 or 2019.",2015 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,RP 99
71,Keller,Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,"From younger, roughly 20-year-old vines, foot-trodden after six or seven days and fermented with 40 to 50% whole clusters, the 2015 Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG is pure, ripe and fresh on the nose, with noble oak, intense cherry and dark berry aromas. On the palate, this is a full-bodied, pure, straight and juicy German ""Geverey"" with fine, fresh tannins, good grip and an aromatic finish. The Frauenberg is even finer and fresher than the Bürgel and offers great vitality, grip and tension. A pretty Burgundian-style Pinot Noir with mealy tannins that will certainly integrate soon. Tasted at the domain in August 2017.",2015 Weingut Keller Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,RP 99
72,Keller,Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,"Keller's 2015 Bürgel Spätburgunder GG has a clear, deep, pure and reductive bouquet of ripe cherries with a hint of oak and nougat. This is a powerful, intense and silky-textured but fresh and highly finessed Pinot Noir with a long, aromatic finish. The tannins are fine and the finish is very juicy. I wouldn't serve this Pinot Noir before 2025, and I guess it will age very well. Tasted as a sample in August 2017.",2015 Weingut Keller Bürgel Spätburgunder GG,RP 99
73,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,"Keller's dark, cherry colored 2014 Morstein Spätburgunder GG ""Felix"" offers a pure, elegant, ripe and concentrated dark cherry and berry bouquet with some coconut chocolate and meat juice aromas. Full-bodied, round and elegant on the palate, this is an intense, dense and powerful red with juicy fruit and firm but fine, spicy tannins. It is well balanced but still very young and needs time to reduce its baby fat a bit. Tasted at the VDP Grosse Lage/Gewächs tasting in Wiesbaden in August 2017. In September this wine became by far Germany's most expensive red wine of all time. It has been sold at the auction in Bad Kreuznach for around 690 euros per bottle and that's the price you'll have to pay, if you can find a bottle.",2014 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,RP 99
74,Keller,Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"Along with the Hipping, the 2015 Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule is the first TBA Keller has produced from Nierstein. The nose shows exotic fruit aromas along with fresh and flinty mineral, iron-loaded notes of the red slate. This is a highly noble, elegant and terribly sweet, but highly refined and finesse-full TBA. It reveals a long and refreshingly piquant and salty finish. This is another gorgeous sweet wine from Keller that is a bit to sweet in the first decades, but none of us with lament about this in 20, 30 or 40 years. This is a great TBA of which only 58 liters have been produced. To Keller, this is the finest of the TBA—the lightest and finest of the Riesling trio. It won't go into the market before 2020. ",2015 Weingut Keller Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,RP 99
75,Keller,Nierstein Hipping Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"Picked with 202° Oechsle and bottled with 14.6 grams of total acidity, the 2015 Nierstein Hipping Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule seems less precise and a bit more volatile at the moment than the corresponding Pettenthal and the Abtserde. The fruit aromas are darker (yellow) and riper, and the red slate is quite prominent. On the palate, there is a great finesse and piquancy that captures the sweetness. The wine is still a bit unsettled, but nevertheless impressive and endlessly piquant and racy. ",2015 Weingut Keller Nierstein Hipping Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,RP 99
76,Keller,Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E Gold Capsule,"The Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E Gold Capsule shows a noble, beautifully clear, ripe and intense nose of raisins, tropical fruits and minerals. Concentrated, sweet and highly elegant, this is a nobly extract of finest Riesling berries. This Riesling is viscous in its texture and very sweet, but balanced by minerals, salt and 15.8 grams of acidity—this is almost an Eszencia. This is a wine made for decades. Highly elegant and noble in its finesse and precise-fruit articulation. ",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E Gold Capsule,RP 99
77,Keller,Westhofen Morstein Riesling Trocken GG Alte Reben,"From an old 0.67-hectare plot with high-density plantings and a low canopy wall, the 2015 Westhofen Morstein Riesling Trocken GG Alte Reben was picked in later October with 92/93° Oechsle and fermented fully dry. It intertwines intensity and power with purity, finesse and freshness like no other wine from Keller in 2015. Clear, pure, fine, fresh and smoky on the nose, with a coolish and unrivaled precise character, this highly elegant wine has great complexity. This is a finessed and singing Riesling with great old-vine intensity. It also has the purity and transparency of a fascinating terroir Riesling from limestone. The wine has that ripeness, intensity, power and concentration of 2015, but there is so much lightness, freshness, silkiness and grip here, too. The acidity is very fine, but vital, and the texture is silky. The grippy finish is full of tension, piquancy and salinity. It's virtually endless in its weightless intensity. This is a benchmark Riesling for 2015 and the most serious rival of the 2015 Forster Pechstein from Reichsrat von Buhl. ""We halved the Morstein quantity since 2011 (5,000 bottles) for the GG, because we harvest only the oldest vines now,"" says Keller, referring to the 70-year-old plot. Keller's 2015 Morstein Riesling GG is the most finessed that I have ever tasted from this domaine. Châpeau!",2015 Weingut Keller Westhofen Morstein Riesling Trocken GG Alte Reben,RP 99
78,Keller,Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese Gold Capsule,"Keller's 2015 Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese Gold Capsule is clear and intense, but highly fine and elegant in its precise and finesse-full aromatics. Round and subtle on the highly elegant and minerally/salty palate, this is an outstanding, finesse-full and frisky BA. This Riesling pairs its concentration and sweetness with freshness, purity and minerality. This is a BA of great finesse and elegance, very precise, long and stimulating. A picture-book BA grown in the Rhine that can only be rivaled by the finest BAs from Mosel, Saar and Nahe. This wine contains some green berries that give the finesse, freshness and drinkability, whereas the TBA is entirely made from raisins.

79,Keller,Riesling Auslese Abts E Gold Capsule,"The gold-capsuled 2015 Riesling Auslese Abts E Gold Capsule displays a very clear, highly delicate, precise and perfectly raisiny bouquet with a great precision and finesse. This Riesling is intense and concentrated, as well as piquant and mineral on the palate. This elegant Auslese reveals complexity, a firm and salty mineral structure and a long, persistent finish. The sweetness is captured by the immense minerality and a remarkable acidity of 12.8 gram per liter! This is a gorgeous Auslese than can compete with the very finest in Germany.",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Auslese Abts E Gold Capsule,RP 99
80,Keller,Westhofen Riesling Trocken GG Abts E,"The 2015 Westhofen Riesling Trocken GG Abts E (abbreviated as ""Abts E"" since Abtserde isn't an official vineyard name) opens very clear, pure, delicate and fresh, but also concentrated (with grapefruit flavors!) and very mineral on the nose. This is a picture-book Riesling from (very active) limestone soils, where the terroir dominates the variety, at least on the nose. On the palate, this is a rich and powerful, silky textured, juicy and yet still concentrated and tightly woven wine. It has great intensity and minerality of stones, rocks and salt. It needs a lot of time to receive the finesse and purity of the mind-blowing Morstein, though. ",2015 Weingut Keller Westhofen Riesling Trocken GG Abts E,RP 99
81,Keller,Monsheim Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"The 2015 Monsheim Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule is clear and intense, very precise and pretty complex in its aromatics. Very concentrated, viscous and elegant, this is a clear, fresh and aromatic TBA with great finesse. It is perfectly balanced and stimulatingly salty in the finish. It's only fault is that it's not Riesling. Rieslaner can hardly get any better than this.",2015 Weingut Keller Monsheim Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,RP 99
82,Keller,Nierstein Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"The 2015 Nierstein Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule displays a clear and delicate bouquet of great finesse and noble intensity; ripe Riesling flavors intertwine with the purity and flintiness of the red slate. This is lush and erotic on the palate, but at the same time precise and clear like a Gothic cathedral. With fine botrytis flavors, this is an extraordinary Hipping Auslese of great complexity and expression. The background is firm and salty, and the sweetness has integrated with the prominent acidity of 11.1 gram per liter. The finish is pure, piquant and so salty that the wine tastes almost dry—almost. Picked at 120° Oechsle.   ",2015 Weingut Keller Nierstein Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,RP 99
83,Keller,Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett (Auction),"From the steepest part of the Hipping (79%), the 2015 Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett (Auction) is beautifully clear and precise on the nose, offering super ripe white pip fruit aromas. On the plate, there is so much grip and vitality, so much salt and precision that you don't taste that there is more residual sugar compared to the regular Hipping Kabinett. This is a pure and salty, very piquant and lovely fruited Riesling Kabinett. This can compete with the finest Kabinett wines from the Saar. There is so much grip and tension here—so much salt and piquancy ,but also sensual white fruit. No botrytis at all. ",2015 Weingut Keller Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett (Auction),RP 99
84,Keller,Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling Trocken GG,"Citrus-colored, the 2015 Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling Trocken GG has a really ripe, intense, yet elegant and almost tropical-flavored bouquet. It does not lack the precision and chalky lemon flavor of the ""Hubi"" limestone rock terroir. Powerful, dense and complex on the palate, this has the grip and mineral tension of a great wine. This is probably the most vital and concentrated ""Hubi"" I have tasted so far. It is enormously salty and tension-filled, but at the same time very fine and as fruit-drive as it is chalk-driven. The finish is tight, long, pure and powerful, and its endless salinity, piquancy and tension make it incredibly stimulating. This is a great dry German Riesling or, as Keller puts it: ""This is how Hubacker should taste.""",2015 Weingut Keller Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling Trocken GG,RP 99
85,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling,"Still yeasty (like beer yeast!) and a bit untamed on the intense and flinty nose, the medium-dry 2015 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling ""VDP Grosse Lage"" is from a very small and shallow part with very stony soils (just 0.29 hectares yielding 20 hectoliters per hectare). The wine starts cool and fresh, very stony and flinty, with an iron-rich and still reductive nose. On the palate, this is a rich and juicy, generous and really powerful, but still elegant and expressive wine. It has lots of salt and a lingering fruit intensity. It is a powerful, but also tension-filled wine with lots of salt and stones on the tongue. Still young, but greater and more complex compared to the Hipping. Keller says that the Pettenthal was fermented two months longer, is a bit drier, but has less alcohol (12% compared to 12.5% in the Hipping). It is a very promising wine and a great Riesling for sure. ",2015 Weingut Keller Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling,RP 99
86,Keller,Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling Trocken GG,"From 51-year-old vines on very barren rocks, Keller's 2015 Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling Trocken GG is clear, intense and precise on the nose. It is very ripe and concentrated, provided with refreshingly chalky lemon and even discreet mocha/nougat flavors. Great purity and vitality on the palate, but it also has lots of power! Its power is very well captured by the concentration of everything: fruit, minerals and acidity. The 2015 Kirchspiel is full of terroir and vintage expression, a dense and round, yet tension-filled and vitalizing Riesling. This wine has a very linear and straight-forward character, with an enormous complexity and power, as well as finesse, grip and minerality. Keller's Kirchspiel was picked in two passes: one earlier and one later. ""It was important to keep the grapes shadowed and to not pick too early,"" says Keller, who was still full of fear in August, due to the drought and heat. But he is pretty happy with the result, today. ",2015 Weingut Keller Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling Trocken GG,RP 99
87,Keller,Nierstein Hipping Riesling,"From Keller's very steep hillside plot with high density plantings, the 2015 Nierstein Hipping Riesling has a lovely, clear, precise and smoky/flinty bouquet with a delicate concentration and red slate flavor. This Hipping is an intense and round, enormously juicy, yet fine and persistent Riesling. It has tension, grip and purity on the palate. This is a great, lush and beautiful wine that is among the very best produced in Nierstein in 2015. Not full dry, it will go for at least two decades. Yield was 28 hectoliters per hectare, so very small quantities here.",2015 Weingut Keller Nierstein Hipping Riesling,RP 99
88,Keller,Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett,"The 2015 Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett is very clear and fresh on the nose, offering bright and stony fruit aromas, but is still yeasty. Juicy, piquant, intense and ripe, this is a racy, mineral and lush-textured Hipping with a long, salty finish. Pretty sweet at the moment (about 40 grams), but this wine has a great future. ",2015 Weingut Keller Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Kabinett,RP 99
89,Keller,Riesling Spätlese Abts E,"Keller's 2015 Riesling Spätlese Abts E is very clear, precise and fresh on the slightly smoky/stony nose, and the racy attack on the palate brings the dead back to life. This is a pure, piquant and elegant Spätlese with lovey fruit and great precision. The finish is grippy, really kicking and salty. This is a Saar Spätlese from Rheinhessen, but still bloody young, and compared to the corresponding Auslese Rieslings, it tastes almost dry.",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Spätlese Abts E,RP 99
90,Keller,Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese,"The golden-colored 2015 Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese is made from a pre-selection of Riesling, Rieslaner and Scheurebe and sells of a very reasonable price in Germany. Spicy and concentrated on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas, this wine also has nice freshness and even coolish character. This is a dense, piquant, elegant, transparent and racy TBA with a stimulating acidity and grip. Very aromatic and easy to drink, but hey, it's a TBA. Total production: 2,800 bottles .375 liter.",2015 Weingut Keller Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese,RP 99
91,Keller,Westhofen Riesling,"Keller's Westhofen Riesling Trocken is from a 51-year-old vineyard in the Morstein grand cru, which included just a few newer plantations. In fact, the grapes were used for the Morstein GG until 2012. Then the Keller family purchased the very old parcel in the La Borne plot, which has been the exclusive source of the prestigious Grosses Gewächs. Downgraded as village wine, but cultivated like the former cru, the low-yielding 2015 Westhofen Riesling was harvested at 40hectoliters per hectare and offers a deep, complex and smoky nose. Round and complex on the palate, with finessed and elegant fruit, this wine is structured by a racy-piquant acidity and a lingering mineral/chalky grip. This is a perfect amalgam of delicacy, raciness, elegance, grip and persistent complexity. Great salinity and precision here! In short, this is one of the finest village wines in all of Germany. A modern classic with moderate 12.5% alcohol. ",2015 Weingut Keller Westhofen Riesling,RP 99
92,Keller,Riesling Auslese Abts E,"The 2015 Riesling Auslese Abts E offers a very ripe, but precise bouquet of golden Riesling berries. Round, intense and elegant on the palate, this is a pretty sweet Auslese with raisin flavors that does not have the racy piquancy and stimulating purity of the Spätlese. Instead it is lush, mouth-filling and really fresh and salty/mineral in the finish. This has a good, well-structured character, though this is not Klaus Peter Keller's greatest and most precise Auslese. It was a bit closed and reduced on the day when I tasted it at the end of June 2016. ",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Auslese Abts E,RP 99
93,Keller,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese Gold Capsule,"The 2015 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese Gold Capsule is clear and aromatic on the nose; it is fine, fresh and aromatic on the palate. This is not a complex, but instead a very drinkable BA with banana and more tropical fruit flavors. Very accessible though, with less exotic fruit, grip and tension than the Cuvée TBA. The acidity is vital and finessed; the finish is clear, fresh and aromatic. ""We never had a vintage in which we produced both TBA and BA,"" says KP Keller. ""This BA was picked straight from the vines, basket-pressed and fermented to 8% alcohol.""",2015 Weingut Keller Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese Gold Capsule,RP 99
94,Keller,Riesling Limestone,"Keller calls the 2015 Riesling Limestone the pendant to the Von Der Fels dry Riesling. It is mainly sourced in the Kirchspiel and Abtserde, due to the dancing character of these sites. Juicy and piquant, this is a refreshing and round, but almost dry-tasting Riesling with a lush and piquant fruit and lots of salt. Bottled with 22 grams of residual sugar that tastes just juicy, but not sweet. ",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Limestone,RP 99
95,Keller,Silvaner Feuervogel,"Keller's 2015 Silvaner Feuervogel offers a deep and subtle, very clear, fresh, elegant and aromatic nose of white and yellow-fleshed fruits (grapefruits and limes in the beginning, stone fruits after more aeration). There are also perfectly ripe pip fruit aromas and some smoky flavors. Medium to full-bodied, round and very elegant on the palate, this has an attractive, stimulating minerality, a vivid acidity and lingering salinity. This is a perfectly clear, highly delicate and perfectly balanced Sylvaner with a good grip and a dry, clear finish. A gorgeous Sylvaner.",2015 Weingut Keller Silvaner Feuervogel,RP 99
96,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"The 2015 Riesling Von Der Fels has been sourced from up to 30-year-old vines for two years, so it is based on ten-year older vines than in recent times to better express the chalky minerality. The wine opens pure, fresh and with crushed stone and bright, perfectly-ripe fruit aromas. Intense and lush on the palate, but well-organized and mineral, this Riesling from Keller's best vineyards reveals ripe and intense, yet still clear and fresh fruit flavors. It is a very elegant, vital and pretty expressive Riesling with tension, finesse and grip. The 2015 juiciness and intensity is as present as the the pronounced acidity, the remarkable concentration and lingering salinity. This is an excellent terroir Riesling. ",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Von Der Fels,RP 99
97,Keller,Scheurebe Trocken,"From Keller's buddy variety, the 2015 Scheurebe Trocken is very clear and aromatic on the nose, where grapefruit, tropical fruit aromas and some coolish leafy and lemon peel flavors are displayed. On the palate, there is an impressive old vine intensity and grip, a deep and refreshing minerality, as well as firm structure and long, expressive finish. The acidity is like a laser beam. This is probably one of the—or maybe the one and only—greatest dry Scheu that I can remember. Just 12% alcohol. ",2015 Weingut Keller Scheurebe Trocken,RP 99
98,Keller,Riesling Trocken,"Keller's 2015 Riesling Trocken is clear, precise, ripe and fresh. This is an aromatic, limestone-Riesling classic with some lovely flavors of crushed stones. The wine is dry, but round and aromatic, very elegant and finesse-full. This is a charming Riesling that finishes with a pretty long, intense and aromatic aftertaste with a stimulating purity and salinity. A Best Buy and probably the finest VDP Rheinhessen Gutswein of the vintage. ",2015 Weingut Keller Riesling Trocken,RP 99
99,Keller,Grüner Silvaner Trocken,"Keller's 2015 Grüner Silvaner Trocken opens clear, fresh and chalky, almost like a Chablis. On the palate, it is richer and more fruit-driven, provided with a racy German acidity and good density. A nice wine for lunch. ",2015 Weingut Keller Grüner Silvaner Trocken,RP 99
100,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,"Keller's 2014 Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix is lovely, clear and transparently pure on the very deep and refined nose; it offers delicate red fruit and even spicy aromas of sandalwood. Silky and round, as well as charmingly rich and elegant on the palate ,this Pinot Noir is good to you. It is powerful and juicy, but also strong and aristocratic. The wine is provided with a fine, yet firm and taught tannin structure. This Morstein combines power, concentration and ripeness with purity, freshness and finesse. A gorgeous German Pinot Noir and surely one of the finest you can find along the Rhine. The Morsten Pinot yielded just 15 hectoliters per hectare, was destemmed manually and fermented for 22 days in a wooden 800-liter fermenter. The wine will be marketed no earlier then end of 2017, maybe in 2018.",2014 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG Felix,RP (93-95)
101,Keller,Burgel Spatburgunder GG,"Tasted as a barrel sample, the 2015 Bürgel Spätburgunder GG offers a lovely, clear, fresh, sour-cherry aroma on the pure and very well-focused nose. This wine is sourced from a protected, south-facing cru with clayey limestone soils, and yielded 32 hectoliters per hectare. It fermented for 19 days (just one punch down per day) and is raised in used Burgundian pièces (second and third passage), scheduled to be bottled in September. The full-bodied, yet also light or lifted wine is round, intense and fruity. However, it is also tightly-woven, very clear, pure and fresh on the palate, pairing ripe and concentrated cherry flavors with grip and a stimulating freshness in the finish. This is the purest, freshest and tightest Bürgel that Keller has ever made. I just love it.",2014 Weingut Keller Burgel Spatburgunder GG,RP (93-95)
102,Keller,Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,"The 2014 Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG offers a ripe, yet precise, fresh, well-focused and rather coolish Pinot aroma; it shows some very discreet toast and mocha flavors highlighting the wild blackberry and dark cherry aromas. Full-bodied, ripe and concentrated on the palate, this is an intense and juicy, almost charming Pinot Noir from low yielding vines on limestone bedrock (21 hectoliters per hectare). The finish is intense and powerful, but well structured due to the stems on which the wine fermented for 21 days. The finish is almost sweet, due to the ripeness (a word rarely used 30 years ago in the higher altitudes of the Frauenberg), but is also very fresh and precise; whereas the ripe tannins give the required grip and structure. This is a promising wine with delicate fruit flavors, mineral freshness and probably more power than the Bürgel; but at least at this moment, it maybe has less transparency and finesse. ",2014 Weingut Keller Frauenberg Spätburgunder GG,RP (93-95)
103,Keller,Abtserde Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"The 2014 Westhofener Abts Er de Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule shows a very intense and concentrated bouquet of precisely botrytised Riesling berries. The wine is richer and even more intense than the Morstein, but does not have a single Oechsle more than this. Concentrated, terribly sweet and piquant on the plate, this is a remarkably well structured Riesling with great intensity and tannin structure,  thanks to several days of skin contact and the basket press that presses with much more DRUCK than a pneumaric press -- and thus extracts more tannins and freshness  This is one of the greatest Ausleses I ever tasted in Rheinhessen and also in this avant-garde estate. This is simply great, not just in quality but also in style. Highly recommended. ",2014 Weingut Keller Abtserde Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,RP (93-95)
104,Keller,Monsheim Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"The 2014 Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Monsheimer Silberberg Gold Capsule offers an intense and concentrated, lovely, precise bouquet of fine botrytis, pineapple and pink grapefruit -- as well as ripe grape berry pip and crushed coffee bean aromas. Sweet and concentrated but also lovely, delicate and elegant on the palate, this is a viscous yet gorgeously refreshing TBA of great finesse and fruit elegance. As if this wine was dedicated to Hans Günter Schwarz, who made Rieslaner famous once at Müller-Catoir. Keller very much believes in Rieslaner, which is more exotic than Riesling, but just yields 15 to 20 hectoliters per hectare. ""That's why nobody is planting Rieslaner anymore. To us it is pure antiquarianism, like driving an antique car."" Since his mum and dad met for the first time while drinking Rieslaner, the variety will never be ripped out -- likewise with the be Scheurebe, as Keller promises. Of the Rieslaner, just 350 bottles (375 milliliters) were made. ",2014 Weingut Keller Monsheim Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,RP (93-95)
105,Keller,Abtserde Riesling GG,"Kept for 40 hours on the skins, Keller's always very low-yielding 2014 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs is sharp and precise on the nose like a laser sword cutting through a chalky rock, leaving dust and grated lemon skins. Coming from a vineyard with high active chalk in the soil, this wine is medium to full-bodied, very pure, elegant, and full of energy and concentration; it is piquant, precise and provided with a straight, super long and tension-filled finish with stimulatingly juicy fruit in the persistent aftertaste. This is great dry Riesling from a difficult year, which was, however, not that difficult in the Abtserde (a special plot inside the Brunnenhäuschen). Due to regularly poor fruit sets (coulure), the grapes are never that compact; the grapes consist partly of extremely small and seedless berries, which might explain the intensity of Keller's Abtserde. Generally, this is a great advantage in misty autumns like in 2014, because the wind dries the berries quickly and keeps them healthy. I recommend to drink the Abtserde from Zalto's Burgundy glasses, which bring out the chalky/salty character even better than the Universal glass from which I tasted the wine.",2014 Weingut Keller Abtserde Riesling GG,RP (93-95)
106,Keller,Hipping Riesling (Auction),"The 2014 Hipping Riesling (Auction) did not ferment fully dry and offers a deep, tropical but also fresh fruit aroma with dusty red slate flavors. Fine and elegant on the silky textured palat,e this medium to full-bodied wine reveals great intensity, power, grip and stunning tannin structure, which makes this a love-me or leave-me wine that has been auctioned by a Chinese retailer. Very unusual for Keller, but with a great grip and concentration. I suppose this old-styled wine will be great in ten years from now and should not be touched much earlier. The wine was auctioned in September 2015.",2014 Weingut Keller Hipping Riesling (Auction),RP (93-95)
107,Keller,Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben,"Keller's 2014 Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben comes from old Sylvaner vines that were grafted with Rieslings in 2009. The wine has a very clear and deep, darker toned stony/flinty aroma than Kirchspiel or Abtserde and shows clear stone fruit aromas along with herbal flavors. There were probably more overripe (at least highly ripe) grapes than in the Abtserde since the bouquet reveals a high density and ripe fruit aromas. Powerful and intense on the palate this is a firmly structured, terroir-driven Riesling with a lot of concentration and juiciness but, perhaps, less precision and freshness than the Abtserde at this early stadium. Indeed Keller accepts more overripe berries than in former years and rates all his grand cru grapes by daily tastings. He does not pick them before they receive a top score. He points out that the 2014 Morstein has less alcohol than the corresponding Abtserde. One can say perhaps that the Morstein reflects more the old vines on colored clay soils on limestone whereas the Abtserde is a light-footed electric dancer on the knife's edge.",2014 Weingut Keller Morstein Riesling GG Alte Reben,RP (93-95)
108,Keller,Morstein Riesling Auslese,"Intense and sweet, but precise with tropical fruit aromas (pineapples) and raisin flavors on the nose, the 2014 Morstein Riesling Auslese is a light, piquant and yet concentrated, spicy wine; it has lovely fruit intensity and fine botrytis flavors. ""There was much less rain due to the Donnersberg mountain than in the Rheingau in 2014, so we got a healthy botrytis,"" says Keller. Indeed, this is one of the finest Riesling Ausleses outside the Mosel of the 2014 vintage. ",2014 Weingut Keller Morstein Riesling Auslese,RP (93-95)
109,Keller,Pettenthal Riesling GG,"Picked late with 28 hectoliters per hectare and fermented in a 1,000-liter Fuder, the 2014 Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling trocken has a somewhat reductive and stony bouquet; it is very spicy and clearly characterized by the red slate soils. Silky textured and finesse-full on the palate, this medium-bodied and filigreed wine shows a lot of tropical fruit, power, finesse, freshness and piquancy. This is concentrated, well structured Riesling with great expression of the Pettenthal terroir. The finish reveals a lovely purity and salinity. ",2014 Weingut Keller Pettenthal Riesling GG,RP (93-95)
110,Keller,Riesling Kabinett H (Auction),"Keller's 2014 Riesling Kabinett H (Auction) from the Niersteiner Hipping offers a clear and intense bouquet of tropical fruits intermixed with slatey flavors. Very juicy and lush on the palate, this is a light-bodied, precise, filigreed, piquant Riesling with an intense and juicy texture, but also a firm structure and mineral expression in the powerful finish. Almost a Spätlese in its voluptuous style . ",2014 Weingut Keller Riesling Kabinett H (Auction),RP (93-95)
111,Keller,Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"Floral and fresh on the nose, the 2014 Nierstein Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule shows a darker toned and spicy, slate bouquet with tropical fruit aromas. Piquant and fresh, very clear and lean, this is a lovely, piquant,salty, really kicking Auslese. It is sweet and filigreed, really fresh and piquant, and so young that I recommend to wait ten or more years. This wine has fine botrytis flavors and is piquant, racy, really kicking and stimulating, with slatey salinity in the finish. ",2014 Weingut Keller Hipping Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,RP (93-95)
112,Keller,Riesling Kabinett P,"The 2014 Riesling Kabinett P is from the Pettenthal and offers a clear, reductive bouquet with ripe bright, tropical fruit aromas and pure slate flavors. Pressed with the basket press,  this wine is enormously juicy and sweet as well as piquant on the palate; it is a very pure and promising Mosel-styled Kabinett from Rheinhessen's Red Slope. It drinks lovely today, but will benefit from bottle age. ",2014 Weingut Keller Riesling Kabinett P,RP (93-95)
113,Keller,Kirchspiel Riesling GG,"From vines planted in the mid 1960s, the 2014 Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs offers a very clear, fresh and precise bouquet of white fruits, lemon juice and chalky flavors. Intense and piquant on the palate, with a lingering juiciness and fruit intensity of old vines, this is an impressive cru with a very good, tension-filled length and stimulating salinity. ",2014 Weingut Keller Kirchspiel Riesling GG,RP (93-95)
114,Keller,Hubacker Riesling GG,"The 2014 Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs shows a clear, more open and fruity bouquet with just a hint of chalk and lemon flavors, compared to the other Grosses Gewächs wines. On the palate, this is a full-bodied, rich, very clear, elegant and quite concentrated Riesling with power, phenols and complexity; but it is less stimulating at the moment compared to the Kirchspiel. The finish is very aromatic in its grapey character, pure and salty. However, the wine should be aged for at least another 3-4 years.",2014 Weingut Keller Hubacker Riesling GG,RP (93-95)
115,Keller,Scheurebe Trocken,"From 45-year-old vines the 2014 Scheurebe Trocken is cultivated next to the Morstein Pinot Noir GG and offers a stunningly pure and precise, but also lovely aromatic bouquet with some dusty chalk flavors. This is a mouthful of wine, very well concentrated and juicy, quite intense, well structured, and with an impressive length and lingering salinity. An expressive terroir wine with a sensual flavor of passion fruit and a delicate acidity. Very good aging potential here. This wine reminds me of the finest Muscat Grand Crus from old vines in Alsace.",2014 Weingut Keller Scheurebe Trocken,RP (93-95)
116,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"Keller's 2014 Riesling Von Der Fels Trocken was born as a selection of younger vines, but these are more than 25 years old today. Sourced in the grands crus, this Riesling trocken shows a highly expressive shell limestone flavor with flinty/smoky aromas of crushed stones, and the typic lemon flavor of chalky soils along with white fruit flavors. Full-flavored, very delicate and finesse-full on the palate, this is an elegant, filigreed, lovely, pure and very frisky Riesling, with ripe fruit flavors and a stimulatingly salty finish. With just three grams of residual sugar, it's the driest von der Fels so far. ",2014 Weingut Keller Riesling Von Der Fels,RP (93-95)
117,Keller,Silvaner Feuervogel,"The 2014 Silvaner Feuervogel is a selection from averaging 50 or more yearold vines in the Dalsheim Bürgel and Westhofen Steingrube. The bouquet is pure and discreet in its white and herbal fruit expression; the wine is dry, pure and round on the palate, very delicate but concentrated; it has less fruit expression than the Scheurebe, but a long and powerful finish that still reveals some stringent phenols. ",2014 Weingut Keller Silvaner Feuervogel,RP (93-95)
118,Keller,Riesling Trocken,"Keller's 2014 Riesling Trocken is pure and lemony fresh on the nose. Medium-bodied, straight and vital, this is a very elegant and stimulating Riesling to quaff and adore. Really crisp and fresh, but with character and a lovely salinity in the finish. Very good. ",2014 Weingut Keller Riesling Trocken,RP (93-95)
119,Keller,Morstein Spätburgunder GG,"Picked with just 11 hectoliters per hectare and fermented with 50% to 60% of the stems, Keller's cherry-colored 2013 Morstein Spätburgunder trocken GG shows a beautifully ripe, sweet, intense but refined and floral-scented grand cru bouquet of red, ripe, dark berries along with spicy flavors. Full-bodied, velvety, concentrated and round on the palate, this is a very generous and relaxed, juicy Pinot of great intensity, elegance and finesse. The tannins are extremely fine here and the finish is gorgeous. Bottled end of August 2015 after 23 months in two-year-old barrels, this is world class Pinot Noir from Germany. 
The texture of the Morstein is so different from the Frauenberg and the Bürgel but the reasons for this are not easy to find. Mass selections? Old vines? The fact that the shots are not headed but winded so that the grapes and berries remain smaller? When Klaus Peter and Julia Keller grafted Pinot selections from Burgundy on the old Sylvaner vines, his father Klaus termed this act ""a waste of time and money,"" and promised to put his feet in this vineyard never again. Today he is fairly proud to know that such a lovely Pinot Noir comes from his beloved Sylvaner vineyard.",2013 Weingut Keller Morstein Spätburgunder GG,RP (93-95)
120,Keller,Frauenberg Spatburgunder GG,"From French mass selections planted in 1996 and picked with 35 hectoliters per hectare, the 2013 Frauenberg Spätburgunder trocken GG has a clear and subtle yet aromatic bouquet of red and dark berries (raspberries, wild black berries, cassis), along with some flinty/smoky flavors. Intense, concentrated and firm on the palate, this is a full-bodied, powerful and firmly structured Pinot. It has a velvet texture, ripe and grippy tannins ,and a persistently sweet and concentrated flavor of ripe cherries and red fruit jelly in the finish. The wine has more power and body than the Bürge,l but also needs more time to develop. It's from a cooler and windier plot, and always the last Pinot harvested at Keller. The 2013 was aged in used barrels, whereas only the 2012 was still in new barrels until the malolactic fermentation was finished. ",2013 Weingut Keller Frauenberg Spatburgunder GG,RP (93-95)
121,Keller,Burgel Spatburgunder GG,"Aged in two- and three-year-old barrels, the 2013 Bürgel Spätburgunder GG has a clear and precise, slightly raw and meaty bouquet with floral aromas. Very elegant on the pure and silky textured palate, with very fine tannins and a gorgeous freshness, this is an intensely fruity, cassis-flavored Pinot Noir with a coolish finesse and tension. Highly recommended.  ",2013 Weingut Keller Burgel Spatburgunder GG,RP (93-95)
122,Keller,Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E,"Keller's 2013 Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E (Absterde) is lovely, clear and aromatic in its refreshing lime and lemon flavors and does not give any hints of botrytis. On the palate this is a seemingly lean and terrifically filigreed and frisky TBA full of character, elegance and vibrancy. The finish is long and salty and the aging potential should be terrific. In the very first moment I found it too honey-sweet and viscous, but the clarity, precision, hidden raciness and mineral backbone of the Abtserde shines through the longer the wine is open. An extremely promising sweet wine. ",2013 Weingut Keller Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Abts E,RP (93-95)
123,Keller,Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese,"The 2013 Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese needs a certain warm-up to reveal its great talents. Flavors of black tea, tea pot, red sand, hints of herbs and tropical fruits, later lime peelings and spring flowers on the delicate and highgly elegant nose, lead this cru to a smooth, noble sweet, highly elegant, mineral and very well-balanced palate of great concentration and subtleness. Very intense and lovely piquant and already accessible, this wine is made for the late 2020s, the 2030s and the 2040s. A terrific BA!",2013 Weingut Keller Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese,RP (93-95)
124,Keller,Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling Auslese ***,"Keller's extremely well selected and precisely flavored 2013 Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling Auslese *** opens with refreshingly flinty and limey as well as floral aromas on the nose. Still young, but expressing a lovely, precise and piquant character with its mineral vibrations, this noble sweet wine has a lingering salty and stimulating finish that is highly elegant and full of finesse and delicacy. The grippy finish is extremely promising. A terrific Auslese from the Hubacker, Keller's most important vineyard in terms of size.

125,Keller,Westhofen Morstein Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"The 2013 Westhofen Morstein Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese offers a clear, still fresh and precise aroma of mineral-flavored stone fruits, orange skins, grapefruit, potted ginger and oriental spices. The attack of this very sweet and concentrated 7.5% alcohol TBA is really racy as the firm structure and the finish is nicely grippy. The tension-filled and piquant aftertaste will make this a very delicate and stimulating noble sweet in 10 or 20 years. The aging potential is surely terrific.

126,Keller,Westhofen Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese,"The 2013 Westhofen Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese displays a stunningly clear and precise fruit aroma of limes and pink grapefruit on the nose. Sweet, intense, highly elegant, delicate and piquant on the palate this filigreed, extremely well-balanced 7.5% alcohol BA tastes like perfectly ripened but still fresh berries picked straight from the vine. Very delicate, fresh and quite pure in the lingering finish, this is a great and frisky BA from a variety that more and more fades into obscurity. Klaus Peter Keller is one of its greatest preservers and his 2013 BA from the Morstein Grand Cru is one of the rare icon wines of the variety. ",2013 Weingut Keller Westhofen Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese,RP (93-95)
127,Keller,Riesling R R,"The 2013 Riesling RR is sourced from the Westhofen Kirchspiel, but the label keeps a mystery about the origin since A) the VDP did not allow off-dry wines from Grosse Lage sites until this rule was canceled again last year; B) the wine is sourced from a small parcel on Rotliegendes whose grapes are not being chosen for the dry Grosses Gewächs because Keller believes the iron rich soil is better for a Riesling with some grams of residual sugar above the trocken border of 9 grams per liter. The wine fermented in an oak barrel that is placed closer to the cellar's entrance, where permanent air streams protect the wine from fermenting to dry, says Keller. The bouquet indicates a clear, full, fresh and mineral aroma with herbal notes along with ripe apple and tropical flavors plus tobacco leaves. The wine is full-bodied, juicy and piquant on the palate, reveals a sweet, Eiswein quoting fruit concentration and shows more power and grip, but less sweetness, than the more ludic Hipping (the Kirchspiel has 12% of alcohol and 15 grams of residual sugar). The long and silky finish bears a lot of tension and makes this a serious wine for the next 20 or more years.",2013 Weingut Keller Riesling R R,RP (93-95)
128,Keller,Riesling Kabinett H (Auction),"Keller's auctioned 2013 Riesling Kabinett H is sourced from the Niersteiner Hipping and was bottled ""in celebration of the birth of of his Royal Highness Prince George 22 July 2013."" Klaus Peter Keller was going to deliver the wine himself to the Buckingham Palace end of February this year and he can be proud not only because his wine was selected but also because it is a great Kabinett from a well-known Rheinhessen cru. The Kabinett H has a bright color with a greenish shimmer. Lovely pure and delicate on the nose with red, iron-rich and flinty slate flavors of the Hipping intertwined with finest Riesling aromas, this is a full-flavored, sweet and piquant, transparent, yet quite intense and minerally structured, light Riesling full of finesse and expression. The aging potential should be great. ",2013 Weingut Keller Riesling Kabinett H (Auction),RP (93-95)
129,Keller,Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese,"""Made from 100% healthy grapes"" (Klaus Peter Keller), the 2013 Pettenthal Riesling Spätlese starts with a very clear and pure, stony and almost smoky yet deep, dramatic and complex nose with lots of fresh herbal aromas along with crisp bread and white/yellow pip fruit flavors. On the palate there is the nice (though still CO2-driven) piquancy with sweet and fruity lightness as well as a firm and zesty structure leading to the light and stimulating, salty finish one may expect from the Pettenthal vineyard. The wine is lighthearted, but seriously persistent and stimulating in its purity and acidity, which makes this dancing Spätlese bright and cheerful like a butterfly. This 2013 can really compete with Keller's personal Mosel stars such as von Schubert, Willi Schaefer or ""Kaio"" Christoffel.",2013 Weingut Keller Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese,RP (93-95)
130,Keller,Niersteiner Hipping Riesling R,"White golden in color, the 2013 Niersteiner Hipping Riesling R is from the same selection like the Hipping Grosses Gewächs, but this particular fuder ended up its (spontaneous) fermentation with 11% alcohol and 17 grams of residual sugar, making the Hipping R the classic halbtrocken or feinherb counter project to the dry Hipping GG. After the irritatingly reductive first moments (the wine was bottled in late autumn 2014), the wine displays fresh and spicy mineral notes along with tropical fruit aromas on the nose. Rich, mellow, full-bodied, piquant, lovely sappy and intense on the palate, the mouth-filling sweetness and tropical fruitiness of this Riesling is as lovely as is the lingering salinity and the persistence of fruit aromas of yellow plums, mirabelles, ripe nectarines and mango. This traditionally styled Hipping is much more fruit-focused than Keller's wines normally are, but this makes the Hipping lovely to drink today, although it can be aged for almost two decades. According to the former owner of this top parcel, Franz-Karl Schmitt, says Klaus Peter Keller, the Hipping always tastes even better with a few grams of residual sugar as if it was dry. (A last word about the reductive beginning of this wine: This aroma was completely faded away after a week and gave way to the same intense and ripe yellow-fleshed fruit flavors that we find on the palate, but is now intertwining with dusty/stony aromas.)   ",2013 Weingut Keller Niersteiner Hipping Riesling R,RP (93-95)
131,Keller,Riesling Kabinett P,"""2013 was a brilliant vintage for Kabinett wines,"" says Klaus Peter Keller who produced two in 2013: The (Hipping) Riesling Kabinett H for Prince George and the the pale yet brillant-colored 2013 Riesling Kabinett P (P like Pettenthal where the wine is exclusively sourced from). The clear and fresh nose already quotes Keller's favorite Kabinett Rieslings from Mosel, Saar and Ruwer such as the likes from Joh. Jos. “Kajo” Christoffel, Carl von Schubert or Willi Schaefer as does the lightness, brightness and finesse of this juicy/fruity 8% alcohol Kabinett, with its remarkable pure or lean and salty finish. This Kabinett is light and detailed like a feather and full of finesse. ",2013 Weingut Keller Riesling Kabinett P,RP (93-95)
132,Keller,Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling trocken Abts E,"For the 2013 Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling trocken Abts E (the spoken term Abtserde is officially not allowed) Keller harvested 40% less compared to 2012 but the 2013 is perhaps one of the greatest dry Rieslings he has produced so far. Lovely pure and fresh limes along with white-fleshed stone fruits (peaches, nectarines), wet chalk, white pepper and tobacco characterize the nose which is fresh, dense and fascinatingly precise. Obviously due to a higher tolerance for a certain amount of botrytis the palate is quite rich, creamy and juicy but less pure and naked than Wittmann's corresponding Brunnenhäuschen. However, this is a dense, tightly woven and enormously complex dry Riesling whose taste is persistently dominated by lime and yellow-fleshed aromas as well as a lovely, stimulating piquancy. This is surely a galvanizing and elegant Riesling to keep for another 4 or 5 years at minimum and enjoy it for a decade.",2013 Weingut Keller Westhofen Brunnenhauschen Riesling trocken Abts E,RP (93-95)
133,Keller,Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling trocken,"Keller's white golden 2013 Pettenthal GG shows a somewhat untamed yet fascinatingly clear, intense (almost rich), and aromatic bouquet of ultra-ripe Riesling berries, wet clay and iron flavors along with Asian spices (curries), domestic herbs, mint tea and dried chamomile. The palate of this medium to full-bodied wine is round, rich and piquant while also very juicy, voluptuous, and impressively long and complex. This is a beautifully balanced, highly elegant wine of great intensity, purity and elegance, displaying refreshing lime and ripe apple flavors in the aftertaste. Already quite accessible it will be absolutely fascinating in ten years from now. ",2013 Weingut Keller Nierstein Pettenthal Riesling trocken,RP (93-95)
134,Keller,Westhofen Morstein Riesling trocken GG Alte Reben,"The 2013 Westhofen Morstein Riesling trocken GG Alte Reben is Rock'n Roll in the bottle! Predominantly from 50- to 60-year-old vines, it is an intense yellow in color and no less intense on the nose where this full-bodied, iconic wine offers ripe yet precise and concentrated tropical fruit aromas along with herbal, vegetal and yeasty notes plus brioche, white chocolate, pistachio, tobacco leaf and powdered limestone. The palate is rich, dense and racy-piquant, tightly woven but also transparent and, thus, pure, very mineral (salty) and full of tension. All this well-dosed power concludes in a still slightly astringent finish (which is positive). This full-bodied, elegant wine develops an impressive length and complexity with a grippy finish that is really kicking. However, you should age it for at least 4 years. ",2013 Weingut Keller Westhofen Morstein Riesling trocken GG Alte Reben,RP (93-95)
135,Keller,Nierstein Hipping Riesling trocken,"Straw yellow in color with green reflections the 2013 Nierstein Hipping Riesling trocken GG shows a super clear, deep, intense yet precise, pure, and elegant bouquet of spicy earthy flavors (wet red argillaceous shale) along with refreshingly perfumed citrus, ripe apple and dextrose flavors and a hint of tobacco leafs. The palate is lovely: juicy, intense, round and elegant with very precise, concentrated and lingering salinity. This full-bodied wine ended up with 12.5 % of alcohol and 4.6 grams of sugar and has everything a classic, wood-fermented Riesling of the highest quality has to have, namely finesse, piquancy, purity and a lovely stimulating finish. This is an excellent to great, rich, piquant and juicy Riesling from the red slope with finesse and expression. ",2013 Weingut Keller Nierstein Hipping Riesling trocken,RP (93-95)
136,Keller,Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs,"Straw yellow/white golden in color, the 2013 Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling trocken offers a deep, dense and complex, fascinatingly pure and developing bouquet of powdered limestone, peeled limes, herbs (tarragon) and white peaches. Rich, round, and complex on the palate, this medium to full-bodied, concentrated, juicy yet firmly structured, piquant and persistently mineral Riesling has a refreshingly citric, stimulating finish and can age at least for a decade. ",2013 Weingut Keller Westhofen Kirchspiel Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs,RP (93-95)
137,Keller,Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs,"The 2013 Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling trocken is not a wine for easy consumption since the nose already is developing from minute to minute gaining more and more complex. Unusually pure and mineral on the nose, the ""Hubi"" 2013 offers rather green flavors of limes, herbs, peas, tobacco, and morels along with just a hint of pie-plant. Full-bodied, intense, piquant and penetrating mineral makes this 2013 one of, if not the most, impressive Hubackers Keller ever produced. The combination of finesse and elegance with power and persistence is really fascinating here. ",2013 Weingut Keller Dalsheim Hubacker Riesling trocken Grosses Gewachs,RP (93-95)
138,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Auslese,"Picked in accord with a similar principle to the corresponding Abtserde and B.A., Keller’s 2011 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Auslese is informed largely by tiny, transparent, super-ripe and in many instances pipless berries (and like the aforementioned, was auction-bound). It started life as two wines picked the same day, one dubbed Spatlese and the other Auslese. Eventually, Keller determined that a marriage, as he put it “was even more exciting and distinctive than either wine on its own. Thus were joined together what truly belonged together: to my mind perhaps the best Auslese we’ve bottled, less sweet than all of our other Auslesen but with mineral depth and a real fairy’s dance (Elfenreigen) on the tongue. If we’re going to have a renaissance of Riesling Auslese, then we have to have wines that are fun to drink, lively and juicy, not heavy.” This wine is everything he just said! Kumquat, tangerine, grapefruit and Rainier cherry seductively scent and lusciously, expansively coat the palate from this oily, liqueur-like yet buoyant and refreshing elixir. Smoke, citrus zest, brown spices and crushed stone impingement lend vibrant, invigorating piquancy by way of counterpoint to the richness of fruit, and this finishes with truly amazing penetration and persistence that will leave you licking your lips, and perhaps even wiping a tear from your eye. Those with the great good fortune to own any of this should plan to spread the pleasure of its company over at least three decades, even if that makes more than one generation responsible for patiently cellaring! 

Cool nights from mid-summer on – but especially in October – played into and seemed to confirm Keller’s strategy of depending on low temperatures to truly release the aromatic potential of Riesling grapes (though he is the first to admit that he hasn’t a notion of why this is so). “It’s critical that you wait for Riesling until you can get into that period” of chilly weather, he opines, “and this year there was no reason you couldn’t wait; and then plenty of time to strategize picking. But,” he adds, “you couldn’t get there if you didn’t leave large enough yields,” because otherwise one’s picking hand would be forced by potential alcohol. In this year, Keller was able to purchase from Franz Karl Schmitt his iconic, eponymous former estate’s best parcels in Niersteiner Pettenthal and Hipping, sites with an illustrious reputation from bygone years that Keller has wasted no time in reviving and polishing. (It was inspiring to be able to walk these particular vineyards on the “Rotem Hang” with both of them late last summer and share in their obvious mutual delight at this historic real estate transaction.) Increased refinement, delicacy, and complexity continue to characterize the best of Keller’s residually sweet wines, and it’s clear that his range of “R” bottlings from top sites – approximately halbtrocken in specifications – is taken with increased seriousness and will expand, annually incorporating at least one such wine that (as is now also the case with Morstein, Abtserde and G-Max) won’t be bottled before August or released before the following spring. Nor has Keller given up his intention – VDP ideology to the contrary notwithstanding – of rendering residually sweet Kabinett from his Nierstein crus; it’s just that 2011 fruit was too ripe (and 2010 had been too scarce). Once again this year, despite devoting more time to tasting the wines of this estate than to those of almost any other, I still cannot pretend to have sampled Keller’s entire 2011 vintage collection, the especially notable omissions being T.B.A.s from Hubacker and Kirchspiel. (Time has also conspired to keep me from reporting on Keller’s 2009 Pinots, which I have as yet tasted only before they were assembled. Numerous details on Keller’s sites, stylistic ideals, and labeling practices can be found in my issue 198 report. And, apropos labeling, Abtserde continues to have to appear in print as AbtsE, even though for purposes of the Wine Advocate database we permit this site to state its name!)

139,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Auslese,"Keller’s 300 liters of auction-destined 2011 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Auslese issued from meticulously-selected, tiny, pipless, virginal (i.e. first-crop) berries, some blushed with botrytis. “When I tasted these,” he says, “I thought, ‘My God, if the wine could just end up tasting as good as these berries!’” I didn’t sample those berries myself, but I’d be awfully surprised if they were anywhere near as exciting – except implicitly – as the resultant wine! Scents of mint and borage in distilled concentration migrate to the palate as part of a seductive mingling of herbal, floral, white peach and melon syrups with kirsch- and mirabelle-laced lime sorbet. At once oily-rich and refreshing, expansive and buoyant, this finishes with positively sizzling intensity so invigorating as to completely belie its viscous, mouth-coating mid-palate impression. Citrus pip and candied rind; peach kernel; brown spices; and crystalline, saline mineral notes are all implicated in the astonishing degree to which this vibrates and grips. Here is one to think about following over several decades, provided you are lucky enough to acquire some and possess the requisite life expectancy.

140,Keller,Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Beerenauslese Gold Capsule,"Keller’s 2011 Niersteiner Hipping Riesling Beerenauslese gold capsule is founded on a search for tiny, generally pipless, super-ripe berries not strongly botrytis-affected, which no doubt helps explain its levity and animation, even though sheer concentration and richness convinced him to declare it “gold capsule.” “The juice ran as pure as from an Eiswein,” he remarks. Sage and peppermint, lemon and orange rind inform the nose and palate with liqueur-like richness, distilled intensity, and bittersweet candification. Despite its sheer density and the confectionary cast conveyed by dark honey, caramel, malt, and candied citrus, this shares vibrant interactivity with the very best wines in the present collection: floral, musky, and saline elements being pitted against citrus and herb concentrates. You’ll find yourself carried away by (and on!) a finish that both soothes and stimulates. Look for 30 or more years of profound reward.

141,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The initial impression garnered from Keller's 2011 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs is somewhat severe and tight, but it rapidly opens with airing and warmth to reveal a dynamic interaction of deeply-etched, predominantly piquant scents and flavors: boxwood and rosemary; rowan, buddleia and heliotrope; apple and white peach with prominent pip and pit; grapefruit and kumquat with prominent zest; stone, salt, struck flint, and alkali. There's such energy and grip in the finish you think your mouth can't contain it! Yet there is at the same time a billowing, wafting sense of what can only be called capital ""E"" elegance. This remarkable wine should be enthralling to follow over the coming decade and beyond, and a bottle that had been open for a day was even more compelling than one freshly-opened.

There is undeniably sweet-sour tension to this ultra-concentrated, oily-textured yet incisively bright libation and a vibrant intensity to its redoubtably long finish.

144,Keller,Niersteiner Hipping Riesling R,"“With a bit of residual sugar behind it, Hipping is unbeatable,” Franz Karl Schmitt told Keller, whose 2011 Niersteiner Hipping Riesling R – which won’t be released until spring – delectably illustrates that claim. “I’m just thankful that I have enough Hipping for two Fuder,” notes Keller of his half-hectare (1.25 acres), “so that I can bottle both a Grosses Gewachs and a wine supported by residual sugar.” (And from 2012 there is a mini-lot of Kabinett.) Luscious white peach, mirabelle and tangerine perfectly supported by residual sugar that is scarcely noticeable as outright sweetness are suffused with crystalline, smoky, stony, and saline elements that promote an invigorating and intriguing sense of dynamic interaction. Subtle bitterness of peach kernel, quinine, and nut oils adds counterpoint to a complex score that culminates in a reverberative and rich yet refreshing finish. This beauty ought to reward at least two decade’s attention, which I predict will be rapt. 

Cool nights from mid-summer on – but especially in October – played into and seemed to confirm Keller’s strategy of depending on low temperatures to truly release the aromatic potential of Riesling grapes (though he is the first to admit that he hasn’t a notion of why this is so). “It’s critical that you wait for Riesling until you can get into that period” of chilly weather, he opines, “and this year there was no reason you couldn’t wait; and then plenty of time to strategize picking. But,” he adds, “you couldn’t get there if you didn’t leave large enough yields,” because otherwise one’s picking hand would be forced by potential alcohol. In this year, Keller was able to purchase from Franz Karl Schmitt his iconic, eponymous former estate’s best parcels in Niersteiner Pettenthal and Hipping, sites with an illustrious reputation from bygone years that Keller has wasted no time in reviving and polishing. (It was inspiring to be able to walk these particular vineyards on the “Rotem Hang” with both of them late last summer and share in their obvious mutual delight at this historic real estate transaction.) Increased refinement, delicacy, and complexity continue to characterize the best of Keller’s residually sweet wines, and it’s clear that his range of “R” bottlings from top sites – approximately halbtrocken in specifications – is taken with increased seriousness and will expand, annually incorporating at least one such wine that (as is now also the case with Morstein, Abtserde and G-Max) won’t be bottled before August or released before the following spring. Nor has Keller given up his intention – VDP ideology to the contrary notwithstanding – of rendering residually sweet Kabinett from his Nierstein crus; it’s just that 2011 fruit was too ripe (and 2010 had been too scarce). Once again this year, despite devoting more time to tasting the wines of this estate than to those of almost any other, I still cannot pretend to have sampled Keller’s entire 2011 vintage collection, the especially notable omissions being T.B.A.s from Hubacker and Kirchspiel. (Time has also conspired to keep me from reporting on Keller’s 2009 Pinots, which I have as yet tasted only before they were assembled. Numerous details on Keller’s sites, stylistic ideals, and labeling practices can be found in my issue 198 report.

145,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese,"Keller’s 2011 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese is informed by tiny, blemish-free fruits, but botrytis is also very much implicated in its quality, resulting in a seductively honeyed cast and a hint of white raisin. Green tea, candied lime peel, and quince preserves convey a metaphorically cooling as well as literally soothing effect, and I’m sure I would not have guessed this blind as a Pettenthal, finding only a modicum of the smokiness or pronounced citricity (and then only as candied zest) that I associate with the site. After the vibrancy and invigorating stimulation of the very best nobly sweet wines in the present collection, one has to adjust to the serene purity and polish, the soothing, viscous though still satisfyingly juicy finish of this B.A., which I expect has at least three decades of high-performance ahead of it.

146,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"Scents of smoky black tea and candied lemon rind rise pungently from a glass of Keller 2011 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese, joined by honey, white raisin and caramel that then inform a viscous and both soothing as well as invigorating palate. Sharp citrus juiciness conveys a sweet-sour tone more obvious than that of the corresponding gold capsule B.A., and there is veritable strictness to the combination of palpable extract richness and severe finishing intensity in this essence of implosively-desiccated berries, a wine that isn’t meant to enjoy over the next 15-20 years but only in the 15-20 years thereafter.

Counterpoint from citrus rind and fruit pit add to the fascination of a vibrant, profound and urgently clinging finish. This should continue to excite for a quarter-century or more.

148,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Rr,"Keller’s 2011 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling RR once again reflects especially ripe fruit from an iron-rich sector in this site and illustrates the rather obvious fact (though one ignored by the vast majority of Germany’s elite growers) that judicious residual sugar can render a riper wine more elegant simply because of reduced alcohol. And rest assured that there is more than enough acidity and extract here to buffer the modest level of residual sugar in question. Penetrating scents of kirsch and mirabelle distillates with hints of mint and a whiff of wood smoke lead to a substantial yet bright palate whose sappy multi-citrus intensity preserves into a gripping finish the invigoratingly piquant and pungent elements adumbrated in the nose. A hint of honey underscores the richness of ripe fruit while salt and stone add further complexity. I would expect this to perform well for at least a decade.

Density and sheer persistence this also has in spades - it's almost muscle-bound - but I'll be very interested to see whether it picks up refinement, differentiation and, for want of a better word (one Keller himself favors), elegance over the course of coming decade. There is an austerely stony undertone to this entire performance; and one that didn't dissipate in a bottle that had been opened for a day. (Incidentally, this is the first vintage of Morstein to be supplemented by a portion of sixty-year-old vines that Keller recently acquired and grafted over to Riesling.) 

Cool nights from mid-summer on - but especially in October - played into and seemed to confirm Keller's strategy of depending on low temperatures to truly release the aromatic potential of Riesling grapes (though he is the first to admit that he hasn't a notion of why this is so). ""It's critical that you wait for Riesling until you can get into that period"" of chilly weather, he opines, ""and this year there was no reason you couldn't wait; and then plenty of time to strategize picking. But,"" he adds, ""you couldn't get there if you didn't leave large enough yields,"" because otherwise one's picking hand would be forced by potential alcohol. In this year, Keller was able to purchase from Franz Karl Schmitt his iconic, eponymous former estate's best parcels in Niersteiner Pettenthal and Hipping, sites with an illustrious reputation from bygone years that Keller has wasted no time in reviving and polishing. (It was inspiring to be able to walk these particular vineyards on the ""Rotem Hang"" with both of them late last summer and share in their obvious mutual delight at this historic real estate transaction.) Increased refinement, delicacy, and complexity continue to characterize the best of Keller's residually sweet wines, and it's clear that his range of ""R"" bottlings from top sites - approximately halbtrocken in specifications - is taken with increased seriousness and will expand, annually incorporating at least one such wine that (as is now also the case with Morstein, Abtserde and G-Max) won't be bottled before August or released before the following spring. Nor has Keller given up his intention - VDP ideology to the contrary notwithstanding - of rendering residually sweet Kabinett from his Nierstein crus; it's just that 2011 fruit was too ripe (and 2010 had been too scarce). Once again this year, despite devoting more time to tasting the wines of this estate than to those of almost any other, I still cannot pretend to have sampled Keller's entire 2011 vintage collection, the especially notable omissions being T.B.A.s from Hubacker and Kirchspiel. (Time has also conspired to keep me from reporting on Keller's 2009 Pinots, which I have as yet tasted only before they were assembled. Numerous details on Keller's sites, stylistic ideals, and labeling practices can be found in my issue 198 report. And, apropos labeling, Abtserde continues to have to appear in print as AbtsE-, even though for purposes of the Wine Advocate database we permit this site to state its name!)

154,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Pungent lime peel, quinine, and kirsch in the nose of Keller's 2011 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs lead into a bright, tart, zesty palate featuring the pungency and piquancy promised in the nose, along with a strong sense of crushed stone suffusion. While this lacks the surprising openness and infectious juiciness exhibited by Wittmann's corresponding rendition, or the combination of richness with buoyancy that characterize Keller's legally halbtrocken RR bottling from another part of this site, it is formidably and stimulatingly persistent as well as capital ""M"" mineral, and ought to be fascinating to follow for the better part of a decade. ""This rocky, stony character appeals to me a lot,"" notes Keller.

155,Keller,Von Muscheligem Kalk,"Representing a co-fermentation of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Gris (as its name states) -from (fossilized) mussel-rich chalk- and a new entry into the Keller line-up, the 2011 Von Muscheligem Kalk is exceptionally successful in projecting the alliance of creamy richness and palpable extract with cut and refreshment of which these two varieties are capable, skin contact in the Gris no doubt being significantly implicated in the wine's invigoration and sheer cling. Succulent sweet corn and peach are tinged with smoked meat, black tea, and chalk as well as seductively wreathed in scents of buddleia and pungent corn shoots. For all of its manifest ripeness and the proclivities of its component cepages, this finished at only 12.5% alcohol, as such representing, Keller opines, a successful regimen involving relatively aggressive vine-hedging and consequent low leaf-count. This beauty should prove delectably versatile over the next several years and quite possibly beyond. (And given that I noted a brief feature about it on the web site of one of Keller's Stateside agents, I presume - not to mention hope - that despite my failure to locate any, at least a bit of this wine has or will come to the U.S.)

156,Keller,Riesling Trocken,"Keller's generic 2011 Riesling trocken delivers pungently stimulating apple skin and lemon zest within a juicy, subtly spritzy fresh fruit matrix, and manages to be attractively mouth-filling while (at 12.5% alcohol) preserving a delightful sense of buoyancy. Salt, stone, and fruit pit help extend a refreshing finish. While the 26,000 bottles of this outstanding value - comprised to a significant degree of fruits of -pre-harvest- in the estate's top sites - are meant for and very much succeeds in delivering immediate pleasure, this wine will doubtless remain delicious for several years and quite possibly become even more interesting. ""You're bound to get a bargain in this price segment this year,"" remarks Keller with a grin, ""because there wasn't much lesser raw material to divert there.""

157,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"Representing as usual a selection from across his top sites, Keller's 2011 Riesling trocken Von der Fels delivers pronounced citrus rind and pip piquancy, along with notes of pumpkin or winter squash with their seeds and myriad - alkaline, stony, saline - suggestions of things mineral. A tad lower in alcohol than the corresponding Gutsriesling, it manages a similar trick of projecting substantiality at the same time as levity and vivacity. This impressively persistent cuvee is likely to gain an edge on that generic if permitted a few years in bottle, even though today it's marginally less infectiously juicy.

That noted, there isn’t for now at least quite the differentiation or interactivity of flavor, nor the floral or mineral nuances (save a chalk-like hint) for which I would have hoped; and the honey-tinged finish is quite dominated by its residual sugar. I would not be afraid though to speculate on this becoming more interesting with time, nor on its remaining fresh for the better part of two decades.

159,Keller,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Auslese,"A 2011 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Auslese illustrates Keller’s ongoing devotion to this grape that he and his wife came to love through its association with their mentor and friend, veteran vintner Hans-Gunter Schwarz. Peach, pineapple, and passion fruit wreathed in decadent perfume of lily and gardenia make for a heady, almost gaudy, and expansively succulent elixir. A slight sense of citrus rind zest is practically the only push-back to this wine’s enormous sense of sweetness. To be sure, with that comes a striking sense of levitation, and there is impressive purity and polish on exhibit here. But I find the finish confectionary rather than at all refreshing or especially stimulating of the next sip, and the hallmark high acidity of Rieslaner is evidently dimmed or overwhelmed on this occasion. That said, I lack experience with older Keller Rieslaner and it might be that those with a less than utterly sweet tooth but a lot of patience will be rewarded by this wine a decade or two from now.

161,Keller,Scheurebe Spatlese,"Relishing his new-found opportunity to play with this variety, Keller has rendered several bottlings from Dr. Scheu’s famous crossing, of which his 2011 Scheurebe Spatlese – like the corresponding Auslese – doesn’t reveal to me any distinct personality of or recognizable traits traceable to Morstein terroir, but instead represents an unapologetically sweet and forwardly, lusciously fruity advertisement for the markers associated with its cepage, notably pink grapefruit, elderflower and mint, which along with apple jelly and lime sorbet inhabit a silken palate and a sustained if rather confectionary finish. With the high sugar here comes alcohol of only 7.5% and concomitant delicacy. I have no idea how this will age long-term but I’d be inclined to give it at least a half dozen years in bottle on hope that its overt sense of sweetness might back-off.

This delightfully straightforward - and yet, if one chooses to pay serious attention, perhaps not so straightforward after all - wine should remain delicious for at least 2-3 years.  

Cool nights from mid-summer on - but especially in October - played into and seemed to confirm Keller's strategy of depending on low temperatures to truly release the aromatic potential of Riesling grapes (though he is the first to admit that he hasn't a notion of why this is so). ""It's critical that you wait for Riesling until you can get into that period"" of chilly weather, he opines, ""and this year there was no reason you couldn't wait; and then plenty of time to strategize picking. But,"" he adds, ""you couldn't get there if you didn't leave large enough yields,"" because otherwise one's picking hand would be forced by potential alcohol. In this year, Keller was able to purchase from Franz Karl Schmitt his iconic, eponymous former estate's best parcels in Niersteiner Pettenthal and Hipping, sites with an illustrious reputation from bygone years that Keller has wasted no time in reviving and polishing. (It was inspiring to be able to walk these particular vineyards on the ""Rotem Hang"" with both of them late last summer and share in their obvious mutual delight at this historic real estate transaction.) Increased refinement, delicacy, and complexity continue to characterize the best of Keller's residually sweet wines, and it's clear that his range of ""R"" bottlings from top sites - approximately halbtrocken in specifications - is taken with increased seriousness and will expand, annually incorporating at least one such wine that (as is now also the case with Morstein, Abtserde and G-Max) won't be bottled before August or released before the following spring. Nor has Keller given up his intention - VDP ideology to the contrary notwithstanding - of rendering residually sweet Kabinett from his Nierstein crus; it's just that 2011 fruit was too ripe (and 2010 had been too scarce). Once again this year, despite devoting more time to tasting the wines of this estate than to those of almost any other, I still cannot pretend to have sampled Keller's entire 2011 vintage collection, the especially notable omissions being T.B.A.s from Hubacker and Kirchspiel. (Time has also conspired to keep me from reporting on Keller's 2009 Pinots, which I have as yet tasted only before they were assembled. Numerous details on Keller's sites, stylistic ideals, and labeling practices can be found in my issue 198 report. And, apropos labeling, Abtserde continues to have to appear in print as AbtsE-, even though for purposes of the Wine Advocate database we permit this site to state its name!)

163,Keller,Scheurebe Trocken,"A Keller 2011 Scheurebe trocken represents the first of its ilk at this address, from vines he discovered in Morstein in mid-summer and on which he immediately placed a contract. Intense scents of sage flower and the rinds of lime and grapefruit presage a sappy, pungent, subtly oily, yet lithe and refreshingly penetrating palate performance. Hints of salt and stone along with the bitterness of rind and pit further extend the finish of this impressive debut, which I anticipate will prove deliciously versatile over at least the next half dozen years.

164,Keller,Scheurebe Auslese,"Featuring a combination of botrytis-tinged and tiny pipless berries picked from newly-acquired 47-year-old vines in Morstein, Keller’s 2011 Scheurebe Auslese smells intensely of sage and mint, which are manifested on the palate as a sort of syrup-like, honey, lemon and grapefruit laced herbal elixir. Soothing and lingering if for now rather dominated by its sweetness (and as such reminiscent of nobly sweet wines of a few years and more back at this address), it ought to respond well to a half dozen or so years cellaring and then remain fresh for a decade or more beyond that.

165,Keller,Spatburgunder Trocken Fr (Auenberg),"Keller's 2010 Spatburgunder trocken FR - from the Frauenberg - accentuates the red berry brightness, vivacity, animation, cyanic piquancy, and saliva-inducing salinity that characterized the corresponding Burgel, all features that can be seen as reflecting both his stylistic proclivities and the natural tendency of this cool, tricky vintage (when it was not harvested until the last week of October). Hints of quinine, rose hip, and crushed stone add to the interest of this sappily, penetratingly persistent Pinot that I could imagine remaining formidable for a dozen or more years.

166,Keller,Dalshemer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs,"Assembled in March and bottled in July of last year, Keller's 2010 Dalsheimer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs leads with scents and bright juiciness of sour cherry and red currant tinged with sumac, fruit pit, and toasted oak. Sappy and penetrating if athletically lean - even a bit spare, as well as almost piercing in its combination of fresh fruit acidity and cyanic piquancy - this certainly bespeaks its author's emphasis on purity of fruit, levity, and what he is happy to call ""red Riesling"" character. Pronounced salinity adds to the saliva-stimulating length of this strikingly vivacious Pinot, and its bitter elements to a sense of grip. I can imagine it being worth following for a decade or more, but as I have written before, Keller's evolution as a Pinot Noir grower has been too rapid for a relevant track record in bottle to have accumulated. (I have not tasted the corresponding ""S"" Pinot - representing Keller's larger assemblage - from 2010.) I would however be inclined to wait 2-3 years before really tucking into any precious bottles.

167,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"As Keller himself remarks, his 2010 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs illustrates the proclivity of Riesling from this amazing site (for more about which, consult Issues 192 and 185) to combine creaminess of texture with utmost energy and levity. Almond and white peach, lime and grapefruit are wreathed in iris, mint, and thyme. As this expansively saturates the palate and as it takes on air, suggestions of cardamom and nutmeg, nut oils and rowan add rich allure. Seductively scented and textured, irresistibly juicy and mouthwateringly saline, this buoyant beauty finishes transparent to a kaleidoscopic, kinetic array of floral, herbal, spice and mineral nuances. I expect it will remain compellingly exhilarating for at least a decade.  (Due to the paucity of the 2010 crop, Keller essayed no separate bottling from this site’s young vines as there had been from 2009.) 

I considered leading off my introduction to the 2010 vintage with a quote from Klaus Keller senior, utilized for the estate’s own vintage report: “We have never experienced a vintage in which along the way we stood so near the qualitative abyss and in the end harvested such fantastic quality.” “It’s not easy to explain all of the efforts we made in 2010,” says Klaus Peter Keller of a collection enormously impressive even by his recent standards and which he claims cost a record number of man-hours, “but certainly the best recipe was to postpone harvest for as long as possible – by which time, the other growers in our sector had long since finished – and then correct (acids) only moderately. With patience and low yields, everything was possible. We only began picking Riesling near the end of October, and for the basic (i.e. generic) level of wines we had to de-acidify from 12 to 10.5 grams, which after tartrate precipitation and fermentation resulted in around 9 grams,” still high for German Riesling, which is to say for any dry wine! “With the parcels we harvested into November,” though, Keller continues, “we didn’t have to correct acidity at all,” and the musts for dry wines registered in the 8-10 gram range. For controlling dauntingly high (13-19 grams) acidity in the eventual sweet wines, Keller emphasized the significance of his having employed a basket press recently acquired from the Mosel that permits introduction of buffering matter without the risk he felt would be run by extended skin contact in wines where “you already had no end of extract and risked ending up with something bitter, ponderous and lacking in tension or interplay.” Not that Keller believes the basket press superior merely for dry wine, quite the contrary. He finds it conducive – indeed, he suggests “critical” – to elegance and transparency in residually sweet Riesling as well. And this – along with generally restrained and especially well-judged sugar levels – has made for as fine a collection at that end of the stylistic spectrum as I have yet witnessed at this address. Finished alcohol levels for all of this year’s dry Rieslings ranged between 12-13% (with one of the Grosse Gewachse as low as 12.2%), the lowest levels since Klaus Peter Keller has been working his family’s vines, but, he emphasizes, more than enough – indeed, more than merely fine – by him, given the flattering flavors and textures he achieved. Keller began bottling the Grosse Gewachse in late spring, with the Morstein, Abtserde, and G-Max bottled mid-August and not due for release until spring 2012. For all of the astonishing range – not to mention quality – of wines that Keller rendered from 2010, one category near to his heart, residually sweet Kabinett, was simply not possible from any of the material he harvested. The latest amazing array of Keller Trockenbeerenauslesen finished fermenting already by June and so was bottled before high summer. “You’re always going to get at least a bit of malo-lactic transformation in wines of this sort that sit for a very long time,” he says by way of explaining his decision to bottle them when he did. Note that as explained in Issue 192, the name of the site Abtserde continues to appear on Keller’s labels as AbtsE, since it remaining legally proscribed – if capriciously enforced – to label with any vineyard name that was registered before the Wine Law of 1971 went into effect but not registered as an official Einzellage thereafter. Now, however, the relevant Einzellage, Brunnenhauschen – of whose surface area the original Abtserde makes up perhaps 10% – appears on what is technically the “front label” of each Keller wine, so I have begun including it as part of that wine’s name. Lest Keller’s – and hence, my – attempt at dealing with this annoying situation engenders yet further confusion, readers should please bear in mind that the name “Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde” as I have now begun writing it, refers to exactly the same delimited vineyard area as did simply “Abtserde.” Once again this year, I did not manage to taste the entire huge Keller collection, even though I scheduled an entirely separate appointment for Pinot Noir. (As mentioned in the general introduction to my 2010 vintage German coverage, I shall devote a later report entirely to German-speaking Pinot Noir, so I have not included Keller’s reds in the reviews that follow). Wines on which I cannot report include a high-r.s. Kirchspiel Spatlese; Scheurebe Spatlese; Rieslaner Auslese; and Riesling Auslesen from Hubacker und Morstein, about these last two of which Keller wrote me, apologetically, in early December that he had overlooked them “in the flood of nobly sweet wines” that he presented during my September visit.

168,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A P #29,"Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A.P. #29 contrasts with it’s A.P. #28 sibling in the way that the auctioned Spatlese and Auslese from Abtserde contrasted with their auction-designated counterparts, namely in coming from the stonier, thinner-soiled upper reaches of the estate’s holdings in the site – though when the 37 liters of this will be auctioned remains to be determined. Yellow plum, peach, and apricot preserves are concentrated to an almost paste-like consistence while shot-through with fresh lemon and grapefruit that drive the intensity of palate and penetrating length without engendering any sense of disharmony and without disturbing a flatteringly creamy texture. High-toned, distilled-strength green herbs and floral essences convey Chartreuse-like overtones while – along with candied ginger – adding an uncannily mouth-cleansing, soothing, yet invigorating and refreshing cast to the at once both seductive and riveting finish. While a faint allusion to white raisin and flattering hints of nougat point toward the ennoblement of berries here, there is not the caramelized or overtly honeyed cast such as were found in the corresponding A.P. #28. This superb achievement will need many years to reveal its full glory and deserves to be savored over at least a 30-year period.

Elegant and transparent to bitter sweetly floral perfume – iris as well as lily – it’s also luxuriously creamy, with quince joining white peach, quince and Persian melon ably and by no means excessively backed by around 60 grams of residual sugar, for an effect vividly reminiscent of those fresh fruits themselves (which Keller claims was his aim). At the same time, this is more overtly mineral – stony as well as somehow crystalline – and yet more infectiously juicy and dynamic than the A.P. #16, finishing with a kaleidoscopic sense of floral fruit and mineral interaction, as well as mouthwatering salinity. Look for 20 or more years of marvelous performance here.

170,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese,"Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese is effusively scented and engulfs the palate with pink grapefruit; candied lemon; yellow plum preserves; and sage and mint at the intensity of distilled essences. An aura of fusil crushed stone as well as hints of caramel add intrigue and allure, with an almost buttery texture leading to a luscious finish that is somehow at once soothing and invigorating. There is a persistent brightness; saliva-inducing salinity; and sheer refreshment, all of which compel the next sip in a manner one doesn’t expect from an elixir this ennobled. Keller says the material here aptly illustrated the potential of vintage 2010 in the present genre, the botrytis having come very late due to the cool October weather, and been very finely dispersed, but then leading to the complete shriveling of selected berries within each bunch. This wine has reached the realms of greatness with Scheurebe that were first staked out and memorably mined at Muller-Catoir by Keller’s mentor Hans-Gunter Schwarz, and a level otherwise achieved only – and then occasionally – at Fuhrmann-Eymael, or (in a very different style) by the late Alois Kracher. Look for 25 or more years of seduction from the 150 liters of this elixir.  “From the moment we pressed it,” reports Keller, “you could smell the pink grapefruit and sense the enormous concentration.” 

I considered leading off my introduction to the 2010 vintage with a quote from Klaus Keller senior, utilized for the estate’s own vintage report: “We have never experienced a vintage in which along the way we stood so near the qualitative abyss and in the end harvested such fantastic quality.” “It’s not easy to explain all of the efforts we made in 2010,” says Klaus Peter Keller of a collection enormously impressive even by his recent standards and which he claims cost a record number of man-hours, “but certainly the best recipe was to postpone harvest for as long as possible – by which time, the other growers in our sector had long since finished – and then correct (acids) only moderately. With patience and low yields, everything was possible. We only began picking Riesling near the end of October, and for the basic (i.e. generic) level of wines we had to de-acidify from 12 to 10.5 grams, which after tartrate precipitation and fermentation resulted in around 9 grams,” still high for German Riesling, which is to say for any dry wine! “With the parcels we harvested into November,” though, Keller continues, “we didn’t have to correct acidity at all,” and the musts for dry wines registered in the 8-10 gram range. For controlling dauntingly high (13-19 grams) acidity in the eventual sweet wines, Keller emphasized the significance of his having employed a basket press recently acquired from the Mosel that permits introduction of buffering matter without the risk he felt would be run by extended skin contact in wines where “you already had no end of extract and risked ending up with something bitter, ponderous and lacking in tension or interplay.” Not that Keller believes the basket press superior merely for dry wine, quite the contrary. He finds it conducive – indeed, he suggests “critical” – to elegance and transparency in residually sweet Riesling as well. And this – along with generally restrained and especially well-judged sugar levels – has made for as fine a collection at that end of the stylistic spectrum as I have yet witnessed at this address. Finished alcohol levels for all of this year’s dry Rieslings ranged between 12-13% (with one of the Grosse Gewachse as low as 12.2%), the lowest levels since Klaus Peter Keller has been working his family’s vines, but, he emphasizes, more than enough – indeed, more than merely fine – by him, given the flattering flavors and textures he achieved. Keller began bottling the Grosse Gewachse in late spring, with the Morstein, Abtserde, and G-Max bottled mid-August and not due for release until spring 2012.

171,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A P #28,"The Keller 2010 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A.P. #28 – selected-out (like it’s A.P. #29 counterpart) in the process of picking the corresponding Auslese – projects honey-drenched, caramelized, sultana-studded, confitured quince and apricot for a more richly and obviously ennobled impression than presented by other Keller T.B.A.s of this vintage. In the manner of the best of its genre, it combines viscosity with wafting levity. High acidity is not as especially obvious – the palate impression is creamy and seamless – but there is luscious, grapefruit citricity, which along with a savory streak of salinity serves for welcome contrast as well as saliva-inducement. A slight finishing sense of edgy tension between the ennobled and citric elements is not unwelcome either, and the wine’s sheer persistence formidable. Any who get their hands on some of its 56 liters would be well-advised to pace the pleasure of opening bottles over more than one generation.

Another instance in this collection of lift, elegance, and sheer refreshment such as one too seldom encounters among Grosse Gewachse, this finishes with tongue-tingling vibrancy, persistently perfumed and mouthwatering, promising excitement over at least the next 6-8 years.

173,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese,"Reflecting a mere 25 liters vinified and aged in a glass balloon, Keller’s 2010 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Beerenauslese is redolent of – and saturates the palate with – peach preserves and candied lemon, shot through with bright fresh lemon; candied ginger; an aura of smoked meat familiar from the corresponding Spatlese; and striking, seemingly crystalline mineral as well as crushed stone impingement. A mouthwatering salinity further pervades the sustained finish of this amazingly site-typical nectarous concentrate. After reaching 6.5% alcohol by May, Keller thought it best to bottle this that way, yet thanks to an almost freakishly high (yet not sharp) 16 grams of acidity – and perhaps, too, through the magic of somehow compatible extract-density and levity – it manages not to come off as excessively sweet. Impressive thought this is today, in the course of what I feel sure will be at least a three decade run, it will shed baby fat and probably take on further complexity.

Vibrantly but not sharply citric, and with its hint of botrytis conveyed more by way of spice than by honey or caramel, this offers scents and luscious, fresh concentration of quince and white peach along with fresh lime with its candied rind, and crystallized ginger. Long and exhilarating, the finish here nevertheless doesn’t achieve the interactive complexity or saliva-inducing salinity that made the corresponding Spatlese #17 so memorably delectable. But anyone who has the chance to follow some of the mere 170 liters of this Auslese for up to a quarter century will almost certainly remain enthralled, and it’s entirely possible that the greatest excitement from it is yet to come. “I think there’s a lot more mineral character here,” remarks Keller, “but for now you’re simply not tasting it.” 

I considered leading off my introduction to the 2010 vintage with a quote from Klaus Keller senior, utilized for the estate’s own vintage report: “We have never experienced a vintage in which along the way we stood so near the qualitative abyss and in the end harvested such fantastic quality.” “It’s not easy to explain all of the efforts we made in 2010,” says Klaus Peter Keller of a collection enormously impressive even by his recent standards and which he claims cost a record number of man-hours, “but certainly the best recipe was to postpone harvest for as long as possible – by which time, the other growers in our sector had long since finished – and then correct (acids) only moderately. With patience and low yields, everything was possible. We only began picking Riesling near the end of October, and for the basic (i.e. generic) level of wines we had to de-acidify from 12 to 10.5 grams, which after tartrate precipitation and fermentation resulted in around 9 grams,” still high for German Riesling, which is to say for any dry wine! “With the parcels we harvested into November,” though, Keller continues, “we didn’t have to correct acidity at all,” and the musts for dry wines registered in the 8-10 gram range. For controlling dauntingly high (13-19 grams) acidity in the eventual sweet wines, Keller emphasized the significance of his having employed a basket press recently acquired from the Mosel that permits introduction of buffering matter without the risk he felt would be run by extended skin contact in wines where “you already had no end of extract and risked ending up with something bitter, ponderous and lacking in tension or interplay.” Not that Keller believes the basket press superior merely for dry wine, quite the contrary. He finds it conducive – indeed, he suggests “critical” – to elegance and transparency in residually sweet Riesling as well. And this – along with generally restrained and especially well-judged sugar levels – has made for as fine a collection at that end of the stylistic spectrum as I have yet witnessed at this address. Finished alcohol levels for all of this year’s dry Rieslings ranged between 12-13% (with one of the Grosse Gewachse as low as 12.2%), the lowest levels since Klaus Peter Keller has been working his family’s vines, but, he emphasizes, more than enough – indeed, more than merely fine – by him, given the flattering flavors and textures he achieved. Keller began bottling the Grosse Gewachse in late spring, with the Morstein, Abtserde, and G-Max bottled mid-August and not due for release until spring 2012. For all of the astonishing range – not to mention quality – of wines that Keller rendered from 2010, one category near to his heart, residually sweet Kabinett, was simply not possible from any of the material he harvested. The latest amazing array of Keller Trockenbeerenauslesen finished fermenting already by June and so was bottled before high summer. “You’re always going to get at least a bit of malo-lactic transformation in wines of this sort that sit for a very long time,” he says by way of explaining his decision to bottle them when he did. Note that as explained in Issue 192, the name of the site Abtserde continues to appear on Keller’s labels as AbtsE, since it remaining legally proscribed – if capriciously enforced – to label with any vineyard name that was registered before the Wine Law of 1971 went into effect but not registered as an official Einzellage thereafter. Now, however, the relevant Einzellage, Brunnenhauschen – of whose surface area the original Abtserde makes up perhaps 10% – appears on what is technically the “front label” of each Keller wine, so I have begun including it as part of that wine’s name. Lest Keller’s – and hence, my – attempt at dealing with this annoying situation engenders yet further confusion, readers should please bear in mind that the name “Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde” as I have now begun writing it, refers to exactly the same delimited vineyard area as did simply “Abtserde.” Once again this year, I did not manage to taste the entire huge Keller collection, even though I scheduled an entirely separate appointment for Pinot Noir. (As mentioned in the general introduction to my 2010 vintage German coverage, I shall devote a later report entirely to German-speaking Pinot Noir, so I have not included Keller’s reds in the reviews that follow). Wines on which I cannot report include a high-r.s. Kirchspiel Spatlese; Scheurebe Spatlese; Rieslaner Auslese; and Riesling Auslesen from Hubacker und Morstein, about these last two of which Keller wrote me, apologetically, in early December that he had overlooked them “in the flood of nobly sweet wines” that he presented during my September visit.

176,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese Feinherb,"Nature conspired to bless Keller with four dry (or at least, dry-ish) lots from the Kirchspiel, of which the 2010 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese feinherb – a 400-liter cask that simply preferred not to ferment further and join its immediate siblings as Grosses Gewachs – is the most alluring and impeccably balanced. Ripe peach, cherry, and sweet lime are wreathed in cherry blossom and lily-of-the-valley, their scents segueing into a satin-textured, succulently fruited, subtly oily palate presentation. A mingling of almond and pistachio oils adds further appeal en route to a soothing, layered finish of elegance and wafting buoyancy. While there is only the slightest hint of sweetness here, it’s perfectly judged and I would be overjoyed if such a thing of beauty as this were once again – as would have been the case a half century ago – deemed a classic example of Riesling Spatlese. Look for at least 15 years of memorable appeal – and, what’s more, versatility and unique opportunities at table from the outset. (It will be interesting to compare this wine’s evolution with that of its Grosses Gewachs and “RR” counterparts, and perhaps I am wrong to think that the balance and the discreet residual sugar will conduce to longer life – though Keller himself doesn’t seem prepared to dispute that contention.)

177,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Spatlese A P #16,"Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Spatlese A.P. #16 – like its auctioned A.P. #17 counterpart, representing a picking of selected rows one day before the corresponding Grosses Gewachs – makes a great poster child for his claims on behalf of the basket press, which he thinks gave a wine like this its edge in terms of wafting elegance and a transparent sense of ripe white peach, Persian melon and grapefruit backed by fructose and glycerin, yet in no way obscuring impressions of crystalline mineral and inner-mouth nuances of honeysuckle and lily. This finishes with soothing, delicate length, though with a faint flicker of electricity. I would anticipate 15 or more years of delight.

178,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"A deeply amber-colored, mere 6% alcohol Keller 2010 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese is extraordinarily intense, with a brightness one normally only witnesses with Eiswein and a flavor of peach preserves as though they had been further reduced to a paste. An almost ominously smoke and lemon rind scent is so penetratingly pungent it makes my nose hairs stand on end – another feature rare outside the realm of Eiswein. This blazingly bright, implosively concentrated Riesling is truly embryonic, no doubt destined to reveal further complexity with significant bottle age, and additional spice and zest emerge even with airing. The corresponding Kirchspiel – for all that I described it as “raw-edged and almost raucously intense” – seems almost elegant when compared directly alongside! But there is no denying that this Hubacker is remarkable for its forcefulness and sheer length. I suspect it will remain a force to reckon with for at least the next 30 years.

179,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Scents of apple, fig, and orange in the nose of Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs faithfully intimate a palate impression more forwardly juicy, fruity, indeed lusher than I have come to expect of dry Rieslings from this site. Not that piquant notes of citrus rind and pip as well as what seems like a mouthful of chalk don’t exert a counterforce, but the effect is a productive tension, leading to a finish that vibrates and glows (there’s that word again, but none seems better for capturing the finishing character of Keller’s best dry 2010s). Here’s hoping this picks up further nuance and complexity with some time in bottle. Certainly it will be worth following for at least 6-8 years.  (Given the small size and high concentration of the 2010 crop, Keller bottled no separate “village”-level Westhofener Riesling from the young vines in this site.)

180,Keller,Westhofener Brunnenhauschen Abtserde Riesling Auslese A P #19,"Leading with a penetrating and alluring nose of candied lemon peel; white peach and quince preserves; pistachio extract and sweetly-perfumed flowers, Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde Riesling Auslese A.P. #19 comes to the palate with a cut and dynamism such as one seldom encounters in this genre. Fresh lemon and lemon peel play against honey, fruit preserves and marzipan. Presumably due to the relatively more water-retentive soils in this sector of the Abtserde, the wine registers an on-paper excruciating 13 grams (whereas it’s A.P. #20 counterpart harbors “only” ten) and there is a tension you can’t ignore, though not outright discord. Fascinating suggestions of green tea waft through this as it opens to the air, and it finishes with an incredible amount of energy and sheer, sharp persistence. Only 250 liters were bottled, and anyone lucky enough to obtain a few should probably not touch one for another decade and anticipate 25 or more years of goosebump-raising stamina.

Now, however, the relevant Einzellage, Brunnenhauschen – of whose surface area the original Abtserde makes up perhaps 10% – appears on what is technically the “front label” of each Keller wine, so I have begun including it as part of that wine’s name. Lest Keller’s – and hence, my – attempt at dealing with this annoying situation engenders yet further confusion, readers should please bear in mind that the name “Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde” as I have now begun writing it, refers to exactly the same delimited vineyard area as did simply “Abtserde.” Once again this year, I did not manage to taste the entire huge Keller collection, even though I scheduled an entirely separate appointment for Pinot Noir.

Kirchspiel Spatlese; Scheurebe Spatlese; Rieslaner Auslese; and Riesling Auslesen from Hubacker und Morstein, about these last two of which Keller wrote me, apologetically, in early December that he had overlooked them “in the flood of nobly sweet wines” that he presented during my September visit.

181,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese,"A vivid evocation of smoked meat (I’m thinking ham hock) such as sometimes accrues to wines from Nierstein’s “red slope” combines with yet more typical tangerine, lemon, and white peach and sweetly musky perfume of gardenia and peony in the stunningly lovely nose of Keller’s 2010 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese. A lusciously sorbet-like expression of the aforementioned fruits saturates the palate. Contrary to the impression conveyed by this wine grower’s two Abtserde Spatlesen of the vintage, his Pettenthal pushes against the boundary of excessively sweet, its relatively static though sumptuously sustained finish tending toward lemon candy and peach syrup, but certainly supporting the persistent sense of decadent florality. The actual residual sugar is not significantly elevated, but the total acidity is 8.5 grams, as opposed to the over-ten registered by the corresponding Abtserde bottlings. It should be fascinating to follow this for the next 15 or more years, because it certainly has more than enough impressive raw material to spare. 

I considered leading off my introduction to the 2010 vintage with a quote from Klaus Keller senior, utilized for the estate’s own vintage report: “We have never experienced a vintage in which along the way we stood so near the qualitative abyss and in the end harvested such fantastic quality.” “It’s not easy to explain all of the efforts we made in 2010,” says Klaus Peter Keller of a collection enormously impressive even by his recent standards and which he claims cost a record number of man-hours, “but certainly the best recipe was to postpone harvest for as long as possible – by which time, the other growers in our sector had long since finished – and then correct (acids) only moderately. With patience and low yields, everything was possible. We only began picking Riesling near the end of October, and for the basic (i.e. generic) level of wines we had to de-acidify from 12 to 10.5 grams, which after tartrate precipitation and fermentation resulted in around 9 grams,” still high for German Riesling, which is to say for any dry wine! “With the parcels we harvested into November,” though, Keller continues, “we didn’t have to correct acidity at all,” and the musts for dry wines registered in the 8-10 gram range. For controlling dauntingly high (13-19 grams) acidity in the eventual sweet wines, Keller emphasized the significance of his having employed a basket press recently acquired from the Mosel that permits introduction of buffering matter without the risk he felt would be run by extended skin contact in wines where “you already had no end of extract and risked ending up with something bitter, ponderous and lacking in tension or interplay.” Not that Keller believes the basket press superior merely for dry wine, quite the contrary. He finds it conducive – indeed, he suggests “critical” – to elegance and transparency in residually sweet Riesling as well. And this – along with generally restrained and especially well-judged sugar levels – has made for as fine a collection at that end of the stylistic spectrum as I have yet witnessed at this address. Finished alcohol levels for all of this year’s dry Rieslings ranged between 12-13% (with one of the Grosse Gewachse as low as 12.2%), the lowest levels since Klaus Peter Keller has been working his family’s vines, but, he emphasizes, more than enough – indeed, more than merely fine – by him, given the flattering flavors and textures he achieved. Keller began bottling the Grosse Gewachse in late spring, with the Morstein, Abtserde, and G-Max bottled mid-August and not due for release until spring 2012. For all of the astonishing range – not to mention quality – of wines that Keller rendered from 2010, one category near to his heart, residually sweet Kabinett, was simply not possible from any of the material he harvested.

182,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Finishing at a mere 12.4% alcohol even though not picked until mid-November, Keller’s 2010 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs smells of apple, pear, and white peach garlanded in hedge flowers and thyme, which come onto the palate expansively, generously juicy and persistently perfumed for a performance of vivacity and levity that finishes with wafting, glowing persistence, subtly bitter suggestions of fruit pit and pip adding invigorating counterpoint. This is to be sure less dense or mineral in flavor than the corresponding Kirchspiel (which comes from some of Keller’s oldest vines) but how much more winsome and (to this taster at least) psychically uplifting! Plan to follow it for the next 6-8 years.

183,Keller,Trockenbeerenauslese,"From around 40% each Rieslaner and Scheurebe, the rest Riesling, Keller’s blended 2010 Trockenbeerenauslese is a wine whose low ex-cellars price is in his words “intended as an entry-level wine to bring new people – especially younger people – to nobly sweet wine.” Glazed pineapple; peach and apricot preserves; lemon and grapefruit combine for an intense and mouthwatering aroma as well as bright though viscous palate. Hints of caramel add interest to a satisfyingly long and not overly sweet finish. This effusive elixir ought to achieve its grower’s (just-stated) aims, and I would not be surprised if it gained complexity in the course of the next 10-15 years.

184,Keller,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese,"A 2010 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Trockenbeerenauslese finished at 8% alcohol, making it the furthest-fermented of any of this year’s T.B.A.s from Weingut Keller. Aggressive scents and pungent, sweet-tart palate impingement of grilled pineapple, gooseberry preserves, and Lapsang tea lead to a finish whose tooth-rattling intensity and ability to nearly cancel out high residual sugar are perhaps not so surprising given an astonishing 20 grams of acidity. (It also – for the fist time in the history of this estate – broke into three-figures in sugar-free dry extract.) Dried and preserved peaches; smoky black tea and leather; candied lemon rind and sultana focus to the point of near-implosion. This rather dense, ominously tense T.B.A. – already possessed, incidentally, of quite deep color – may well be a very long-keeper, but I would want to monitor it at least once or twice over the coming decade.

185,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The Keller 2010 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs delivers zesty fresh lemon and milled grain on the nose as well as on a firm, overtly chalk-dusted palate for a personality more than a little reminiscent of a high-acid (and indeed, high-strung!) white Burgundy. A welcome, saliva-inducing sense of salinity emerges in a glowingly persistent finish, with piquancy of peach kernel and almond lending some counterpoint. This understated, relatively austere but (at just 12.2% alcohol) buoyant and intense Riesling should be worth following for at least the next half dozen years, though it will have to prove to me that it can become more friendly than formidable. There are, incidentally, a mere 500 liters, the smallest lot of Grosses Gewachs in this collection.

Finished alcohol levels for all of this year’s dry Rieslings ranged between 12-13% (with one of the Grosse Gewachse as low as 12.2%), the lowest levels since Klaus Peter Keller has been working his family’s vines, but, he emphasizes, more than enough – indeed, more than merely fine – by him, given the flattering flavors and textures he achieved. Keller began bottling the Grosse Gewachse in late spring, with the Morstein, Abtserde, and G-Max bottled mid-August and not due for release until spring 2012. For all of the astonishing range – not to mention quality – of wines that Keller rendered from 2010, one category near to his heart, residually sweet Kabinett, was simply not possible from any of the material he harvested. The latest amazing array of Keller Trockenbeerenauslesen finished fermenting already by June and so was bottled before high summer. “You’re always going to get at least a bit of malo-lactic transformation in wines of this sort that sit for a very long time,” he says by way of explaining his decision to bottle them when he did. Note that as explained in Issue 192, the name of the site Abtserde continues to appear on Keller’s labels as AbtsE, since it remaining legally proscribed – if capriciously enforced – to label with any vineyard name that was registered before the Wine Law of 1971 went into effect but not registered as an official Einzellage thereafter. Now, however, the relevant Einzellage, Brunnenhauschen – of whose surface area the original Abtserde makes up perhaps 10% – appears on what is technically the “front label” of each Keller wine, so I have begun including it as part of that wine’s name. Lest Keller’s – and hence, my – attempt at dealing with this annoying situation engenders yet further confusion, readers should please bear in mind that the name “Brunnenhauschen - Abtserde” as I have now begun writing it, refers to exactly the same delimited vineyard area as did simply “Abtserde.” Once again this year, I did not manage to taste the entire huge Keller collection, even though I scheduled an entirely separate appointment for Pinot Noir. (As mentioned in the general introduction to my 2010 vintage German coverage, I shall devote a later report entirely to German-speaking Pinot Noir, so I have not included Keller’s reds in the reviews that follow).

187,Keller,Silvaner Trocken Feuervogel,"Keller’s Stuckfass-raised 2010 Silvaner trocken Feuervogel – from older vines that grow nearly cheek-by-jowl with those that inform his regular (“Gruner”) bottling – suggests subtle roasting and caramelization of the apple and turnip found in that lighter wine as well; but here a bit of florality, lift, citricity and sheer refreshment are sacrificed for the sake of greater richness; substantiality (at 13% alcohol); lip-smacking salinity; and impressively persistent nutty, chalky, stony mineral undertones. It will be interesting to discover whether this proves longer-lived than its ostensibly lesser sibling, but I am sure that over the next several years it will prove delightfully useful at table, if with very different sorts of fare. 

I considered leading off my introduction to the 2010 vintage with a quote from Klaus Keller senior, utilized for the estate’s own vintage report: “We have never experienced a vintage in which along the way we stood so near the qualitative abyss and in the end harvested such fantastic quality.” “It’s not easy to explain all of the efforts we made in 2010,” says Klaus Peter Keller of a collection enormously impressive even by his recent standards and which he claims cost a record number of man-hours, “but certainly the best recipe was to postpone harvest for as long as possible – by which time, the other growers in our sector had long since finished – and then correct (acids) only moderately. With patience and low yields, everything was possible. We only began picking Riesling near the end of October, and for the basic (i.e. generic) level of wines we had to de-acidify from 12 to 10.5 grams, which after tartrate precipitation and fermentation resulted in around 9 grams,” still high for German Riesling, which is to say for any dry wine! “With the parcels we harvested into November,” though, Keller continues, “we didn’t have to correct acidity at all,” and the musts for dry wines registered in the 8-10 gram range. For controlling dauntingly high (13-19 grams) acidity in the eventual sweet wines, Keller emphasized the significance of his having employed a basket press recently acquired from the Mosel that permits introduction of buffering matter without the risk he felt would be run by extended skin contact in wines where “you already had no end of extract and risked ending up with something bitter, ponderous and lacking in tension or interplay.” Not that Keller believes the basket press superior merely for dry wine, quite the contrary. He finds it conducive – indeed, he suggests “critical” – to elegance and transparency in residually sweet Riesling as well.

188,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Rr,"Keller’s 2010 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling RR once again represents an especially ripe lot from an especially iron-rich sector in this site – evidently routinely conducive to enhanced ripeness – that once again finished fermenting marginally above the legal cut-off for Trockenheit. (It had already reached 13% alcohol, the maximum exhibited by any of this year’s Keller Grosse Gewachse.) Peach and apple are overlain by curry and maritime breeze, whose manifestations on the palate are piquantly marked by toasted hickory. There is both palpable extract and a welcome impression of lift and impressive length here, but also a certain sense of opacity that precludes quite the degree of focus and refreshment that accrue to this vintage’s collection of Keller Grosse Gewachse. I’d like to think that is a temporary state – not that this wine isn’t lovely nonetheless – especially given that I am such a partisan of legally halbtrocken alternatives in general. (Residual sugar per se may well not be implicated in what I referred to as “opacity” anyway.) I would jump at a chance to taste it again, but won’t attempt to prognosticate as to its future trajectory.

189,Keller,Gruner Silvaner Trocken,"Keller’s basic 2010 Gruner Silvaner trocken suggests apple, lime, and turnip garnished with sweet clover, apple blossom, coriander, and oregano in a subtly herbal yet juicily fruity; refreshing; buoyant; yet palpably extract-rich performance that demonstrates the distinctively delicious possibilities offered this grape in this vintage. Compared to the norm for Silvaner – even more so than Riesling, notes Keller, this year’s yields were especially low and hang time especially long, not to mention, of course, the combination of exceptionally high acidity and dry extract. This excellent value (in ex-cellar terms, at least; so let’s hope some reaches U.S. shores) should remain deliciously versatile for at least the next three years.

191,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"“From the first day of fermentation, I smelled this and got goose bumps,” says Klaus-Peter Keller of his 2009 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs, and the same can be said of the finished wine, which – impressive as are those that preceded it in this year’s collection – plays in a different league. The dynamic complexity of elements for which one can find only mineral descriptors (and then very imperfect ones) is already astonishing: salt; chalk; alkali; shrimp shell reduction; iodine; and peat are already adumbrated on the nose and then spell-bindingly and intricately interwoven on a silken field with grapefruit, white peach, and Ranier cherry, nut oils and bitter-sweet floral perfume into a delectable, nearly demonic dance that leaves my mouth drooling and my tongue quivering helplessly in hopeful anticipation of the next sip. This transfixes and refreshes, yet greed still leaves me unsatisfied, and I fantasize about the Bishop of Worms – who once got first crack at the wine of Abtserde – denying me communion with this rarified and seemingly magical elixir. “The active lime content in this site is measurably enormous and unique among my vineyards,” notes Keller, convinced that its effects lie at the root of this Riesling’s animated complexity. A transparent exemplification of Keller’s Riesling ideals and of a great site, this will, I feel confident, continue to amaze for at least the next 15 years. (From vintage 2008, the name of the site was still disguised as a website address on labels of Keller wine from Abtserde by being written: Abts E.de. This year, that has been shortened to Abts E in a renewed attempt to avoid conflict with the legal proscription – in some regions treated as a technicality; in some selectively observed; in some rigorously enforced – on mentioning any of thousands of vineyard names that were officially eliminated by the 1971 Wine Law. I decided this wine is by now so justifiably well-known that we could simply write “Abtserde” for Wine Advocate purposes. Incidentally, Keller recently pushed back by more than 150 years – to 1380 – the first known reference to this “abbot’s plot.”)

Klaus-Peter Keller’s stylistic ideals and parameters – for more about whose application to vintage 2009 consult the quotes from him at two places in my introduction to this report – were aptly realized in a collection of Grosse Gewachse (all bottled in mid-August) that ranged from 12.5-13.5% in alcohol. “I can always cut away bunches,” he remarked apropos yields. “That merely means extra work. But you can’t hang new bunches on your vines, and in warm years, to have that third or fourth one is critical” to avoiding too rapid an accretion of sugar. The cool temperatures by the time he harvested his top sites in early November not only, claims Keller, offered the ideal circumstances for phenolic evolution and acid retention, but also for gentle extraction in the initial hours after harvest, when the fruit received the period of maceration that he believes is essential to getting at “the two-thirds of Riesling’s aromas are in its skin.” And as if the rest of the wines did not represent a sufficiently amazing performance, it concludes with no fewer than four Trockenbeerenauslesen (5 were planned, but the grapes left in Hubacker got rained-out), about which Keller claims not to know for sure whether it represents a record for his estate (though it definitely does for the period of his tenure, and – unbelievably – he repeated that record again in 2010). “Day in, day out we sorted grapes into the night,” relates Keller, but it should be borne in mind that the quantities of each of these T.B.A.s – as I have noted in each tasting note – remained minuscule. Keller is excited about 2009’s potential with Pinot as well, but surveying his finished 2008 Spatburgunder – all of which were moved solely by gravity, a forklift having served to elevate their assembled volumes for bottling – there is more than enough excitement generated by those as well to merit a search of the marketplace and to offer wine lovers a striking glimpse of the quality levels to which German Pinot Noir can successfully aspire. I’ll report on the 2009 reds next year. (For more about Keller’s governing principles with Riesling as well as Pinot, consult the introduction to my notes on his wines in issue 187.)

192,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese gold capsule – sold at auction – introduces dimensions unimagined in its Kirchspiel and Morstein counterparts. Musk oil, smoky black tea, candied grapefruit, glazed pineapple, peach preserves, nougat, marzipan, crystallized ginger, caramel, and dried apricots are among the cast of a richly-textured, strikingly vibrant performance. There is a combination of polish and electricity, viscosity and sheer grip that you won’t often encounter regardless of the level of residual sugar involved and an invigorating, saliva-inducing, saline savor amazing for a wine so intensely botrytized. As this matures – however many of its 35 liters are left alone long enough, perhaps up to 30 or 40 years – it may well (awesome thought!) add yet further complexity.

193,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"Lemon candy and quince preserves, and seemingly distilled and liqueur-like herbal essences dominate the Keller 2009 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese whose acidity – at 17 grams, high even by Eiswein standards – not only wards off any sense of superficiality to its sweetness but also lends almost electro-charged vibrancy to this amazing, viscous elixir whose finish suggests a mingling of Chartreuse, nut brittle, honey, and quince preserves, as well as suggesting perhaps some sort of confection which, once bitten into, explodes with unexpected brightness. I can well imagine this remaining fresh for three or four decades, though I can’t help wondering how many – or rather, how few – of its 60 liters will at that stage remain un-metabolized by humans. 

Klaus-Peter Keller’s stylistic ideals and parameters – for more about whose application to vintage 2009 consult the quotes from him at two places in my introduction to this report – were aptly realized in a collection of Grosse Gewachse (all bottled in mid-August) that ranged from 12.5-13.5% in alcohol. “I can always cut away bunches,” he remarked apropos yields. “That merely means extra work. But you can’t hang new bunches on your vines, and in warm years, to have that third or fourth one is critical” to avoiding too rapid an accretion of sugar. The cool temperatures by the time he harvested his top sites in early November not only, claims Keller, offered the ideal circumstances for phenolic evolution and acid retention, but also for gentle extraction in the initial hours after harvest, when the fruit received the period of maceration that he believes is essential to getting at “the two-thirds of Riesling’s aromas are in its skin.” And as if the rest of the wines did not represent a sufficiently amazing performance, it concludes with no fewer than four Trockenbeerenauslesen (5 were planned, but the grapes left in Hubacker got rained-out), about which Keller claims not to know for sure whether it represents a record for his estate (though it definitely does for the period of his tenure, and – unbelievably – he repeated that record again in 2010). “Day in, day out we sorted grapes into the night,” relates Keller, but it should be borne in mind that the quantities of each of these T.B.A.s – as I have noted in each tasting note – remained minuscule.

194,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Trockenbeerenauslese,"Quince and apricot preserves, honey, glazed pineapple and nougat vie for attention on the nose and viscously rich palate of Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese, which like its Kirchspiel counterpart is also shot through with luscious citrus. Bittersweet grapefruit rind, black tea, and toasted nuts add counterpoint all the way through a seemingly inextinguishable finish whose audacity and vigor left me wide eyed and mouth agape. There are only 30 liters of this striking elixir any of which should remain in good health for 30-40 years if left in a corkscrew-free zone.

195,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Auslese,"The 2009 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Auslese gold capsule – an auction bottling – incorporated, says Keller, a high percentage of shriveled but not spore-tinged berries, which accounts for its nearly Eiswein-like acidity. Crystallized ginger, glazed pineapple, and lime sorbet are all suggested on a head-turning nose and luscious, slickly honeyed, glycerin-rich, subtly caramelized, and yet – for all that – buoyant, vivacious, and downright refreshing palate. Nougat, creme caramel and overripe Persian melon add to a sense of decadence, yet this wine’s succulent citricity continues to both invigorate as well as sooth. It ought to be worth savoring over a 25-30 year period.

196,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2009 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs offers a somehow cooler but no less complex or mysterious floral bouquet – here suggestive of gentian and iris – than did its counterpart from 2008. Scents and saliva-inducing impingement of apple, fresh lime, chalk, and salt ignites an invigorating, almost levitating finishing interchange of fresh and distilled fruit, floral, fruit pit, and mineral elements. Dynamically bright yet coolly refreshing and with a striking, shimmering sense of clarity (but by no means cool in the stand-offish manner of the corresponding Kirchspiel), this beauty should be fascinating to follow over the next dozen or more years.  No doubt Keller is correct – these are, after all, among his own precious children – in judging this Hubacker to be at a more expressive stage than the corresponding (in his words “shier, more restrained”) Kirchspiel, but I perceive the expression of brightness and minerality of Hubacker as inherently more engaging.

197,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"From Keller’s inaugural vintage in the “Rotem Hang,” his 2009 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Grosses Gewachs originated in the identical lot of grapes that informed the tiny amount of corresponding Spatlese, and which weren’t harvested until November 1, immediately before Keller commenced picking the chalky top sites in Dalsheim and Westhofen. Ripe peach, orange, almond, floral suggestions of buddleia and narcissus, as well as a peaty smokiness and an aura of crushed stone offer a dazzling, site-typical aromatic melange. Superb purity of fruit on a satiny, luscious palate encounter in this wine’s gripping and vibratory finish a near whiplash of smoky crushed stone mineral character, citrus rind piquancy, and catnip-like herbal pungency. This will be exciting to follow over the coming decade and hopefully beyond.

198,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Long Gold Capsule,"Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese long gold capsule offers an intense amalgam of butter cream, marzipan, glazed pineapple, peach preserves, and caramel in an almost gelatinously viscous form. There is a shimmering underlying brightness analogous to the energy stored-up in Keller’s other three T.B.A.s of the vintage that is trying here to burst through a seamless wall of confection, but for now, sheer richness and superficial sweetness dominate the proceedings. Black tea, tobacco, and brown spices add an almost ominous degree of intrigue to the nose as it takes on air. Expect a lightning strike one of these days – in the event that you were ever to acquire a smidgeon of the 25 liters that were bottled, a significant share of which will at some point be auctioned (and the rest no doubt destined to remain deep within Keller’s own cellar). Its having only been bottled along with the Grosse Gewachse in August could account for some of this wine’s impenetrability, but I think it more likely that this is simply in the nature of the beast – and I use that last word advisedly.

199,Keller,Rieslaner Spatlese,"The Keller 2009 Rieslaner Spatlese – from the Monsheimer Silberberg, but in deference to widespread VDP practice with non-Rieslings, labeled generically – offers a forward, luscious, subtly creamy, yet bright and buoyant example of its variety’s virtues. Pineapple, white peach, and blood orange are beautifully backed by sweetness that’s checked by this grape’s notoriously efficacious acidity. Suggestions of brown-spiced, pickled melon rind and a streak of salt lend saliva-inducing invigoration to an effusively juicy, impeccably-balanced finish. Despite Rieslaner’s inherently high acidity and despite his having been coached in its propagation and vinification by the grand master of this variety (indeed, the person who literally lifted it from Franconian obscurity), Hans-Gunter Schwarz, Keller’s previous renditions have often struck me as too superficially sweet. Not so this, which in fact could already play in Schwarz’s league. I would anticipate at least 15 years of good health from bottles of it.

At the same time, though, there is a sense of buoyancy and an upwelling of lusciously juicy fruit in the finish as well as an attractively cooling suggestion of mint and a sheer vibrancy that goes beyond its fellow “regular” Auslesen.

202,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Now not slated to be released until 2011, Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs seems almost at pains to prove the wisdom of that choice by offering a pithy fruit skin chew and an almost gum-numbing, persimmon-like pungency, allied to tingling brightness of fresh lemon, pink grapefruit, and bitter tartness of its zest that offer a prickly rebuff to anyone anticipating immediate pleasure. This is an embryonic and severely concentrated young Riesling, though one whose energy certainly appears equal to its sheer density. It finishes with pointed bitterness, blazing citric intensity, and a formidable, near avalanche of crushed stone and other less identifiable mineral elements – seemingly unstoppable ? which is not the same as saying it’s irresistible (at least, not for now)! I wrote in my initial notes that “only time can tell whether this has a gentler side to its undeniably complex and formidable personality, and it will be most interesting to follow its evolution during the coming decade.” Eleven days later (!), Keller confronted me, blind, with the contents of the same bottle, and the wine was not only pristine in terms of its absence of oxidation, it also displayed greater primary juiciness and clarity to a more refined diversity of mineral elements.

203,Keller,Riesling Trocken A,"From younger vines in the Abtserde, Keller’s 2009 Riesling trocken A is alluringly-scented with iris, white peach and almond; allies a subtle creaminess with lusciously refreshing white grapefruit and lemon; and finishes with lift and energy as well as salt, chalk, and iodine mineral intrigue. In short, it’s very much the smaller-scale model of Keller’s Abtserde Grosses Gewachs, and its combination of cool refreshment and minerality with generous juiciness and buoyancy (rather than with aloofness or strictness) is what above all fascinates and delights me about Riesling from this clearly great site. The present exemplar ought to prove deliciously versatile for at least the next half dozen years, but probably much longer. 

Klaus-Peter Keller’s stylistic ideals and parameters – for more about whose application to vintage 2009 consult the quotes from him at two places in my introduction to this report – were aptly realized in a collection of Grosse Gewachse (all bottled in mid-August) that ranged from 12.5-13.5% in alcohol. “I can always cut away bunches,” he remarked apropos yields. “That merely means extra work. But you can’t hang new bunches on your vines, and in warm years, to have that third or fourth one is critical” to avoiding too rapid an accretion of sugar. The cool temperatures by the time he harvested his top sites in early November not only, claims Keller, offered the ideal circumstances for phenolic evolution and acid retention, but also for gentle extraction in the initial hours after harvest, when the fruit received the period of maceration that he believes is essential to getting at “the two-thirds of Riesling’s aromas are in its skin.” And as if the rest of the wines did not represent a sufficiently amazing performance, it concludes with no fewer than four Trockenbeerenauslesen (5 were planned, but the grapes left in Hubacker got rained-out), about which Keller claims not to know for sure whether it represents a record for his estate (though it definitely does for the period of his tenure, and – unbelievably – he repeated that record again in 2010). “Day in, day out we sorted grapes into the night,” relates Keller, but it should be borne in mind that the quantities of each of these T.B.A.s – as I have noted in each tasting note – remained minuscule.

204,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The Keller 2009 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs features pungent, piquant lime zest, peach kernel, and cherry pit allied to tart citrus and yellow plum, salt and chalk, all of which make for an almost fiercely penetrating and invigoratingly persistent if spare and lightly astringent performance. This certainly isn’t about flattery or ingratiation. German growers and critics love applying the word “puristic” to such a Riesling, which I suppose is better than “puritanical” – but my, is this wine strict! As it took on air, a slightly more enticing, saliva-inducing sense of salinity and shellfish reduction emerged. I don’t envision it ever achieving the delicacy and poise that its 2008 rendition displayed even at this young age, but it should certainly be fascinating as well as palate-stimulating to follow in the course of the coming decade. While Keller has now begun to implement the plan I discussed in issue 187 of releasing some Grosse Gewachse only in the year after bottling, that delayed release will not apply to either the Hubacker or Kirchspiel, although based on my perception of the latter’s personality, it above all should be considered as a candidate.

205,Keller,Riesling Kabinett P(Ettenthal),"While the Rheinhessen VDP chapter may not ape their colleagues in the Rheingau by limiting the mention on labels of certain traditionally outstanding sites to at most their initials, Keller’s 2009 Riesling Kabinett P testifies to an even more outrageous policy of considering any Riesling classified by its grower as “Kabinett” to thereby forfeit the right to identity papers, even if it came from the great Pettenthal. “If it’s from such a great vineyard,” is the implicit (and quite frankly, ignorant) question, “then why isn’t it a Grosses Gewachs or at the very least a nobly sweet Spatlese or Auslese?” (And these folks get riled-up if one accuses them of stylistic dictatorship?) This wine represents the October 10 “pre-harvest” of the Kellers’ newly-acquired Pettenthal parcel, but that should not be taken as any indication that it is merely a byproduct of the Grosses Gewachs or the sweet Spatlese that originated in the subsequent picking. Keller – who reveres inter alia the most delicate Mosel Rieslings of “Kajo” Christoffel, Carl von Schubert, and Willi Schaefer – envisioned a Pettenthal Kabinett from the beginning. As brimming with peachy ripeness and grapefruit lusciousness as it is glossy in texture and (at 9% alcohol) buoyant, this one captures in its soothing yet refreshing finish the typical smokiness and crushed stone aura associated with its site. I suspect it will be at its best over the next 6-8 years, but it represents a new voyage of adventure in that respect too (as well as a fine value).

206,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese,"A 2009 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese offers Keller as well as this decisively mineral-displaying site a chance to show what they can do in the echelons of high residual sugar. Pear and Ranier cherry in the nose migrate to a glossy, sappy, succulent, and unabashedly sweet palate while saline as well as chalky inflections lend invigorating interest and counter the sense of sweetness in a lip-smackingly long finish. This will perform deliciously for at least a dozen years.

207,Keller,Silvaner Trocken Feuervogel,"From 53 year old vines (nearly twice the age of those that inform his basic bottling), Keller’s 2009 Silvaner trocken Feuervogel dispenses with the “Gruner” part of its grape’s name and adds the designation “firebird” in an effort to call attention to its being Silvaner of a different sort. Vinification in cask helps accentuate the sense of ripeness, textural richness, and underlying structure on display, but in fact the flavors build on those of his “Gruner” bottling. Green herbs, a hint of gooseberry, apple, and honeydew melon deliver juicy refreshment, while hazelnut, freshly-milled grains, peat, and chalk add seriously complex undertones. Silken in texture, this positively shimmers in its long, vivacious finishing expression of mineral-fruit interplay. Employ it for at least half a dozen years. Keller notes that an old Silvaner vineyard like this is expensive to manage, since the rows are too narrowly spaced for any tractor and require the adaptation of specialized machinery. So he has taken the risk both to care for them and to ask 20 Euros retail per bottle (surely unheard of for this variety anywhere in the world outside of Franken).

208,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Auslese,"As with its counterpart from the Kirchspiel, Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Auslese was selected out just ahead of the early November picking for the corresponding Grosses Gewachs. Mirabelle preserves, peach jam, and overripe honeydew melon offer a seductive aroma and a luscious palate impression backed by a silken texture and exhibiting the sort of juicy refreshment that’s possible with Riesling even in a wine so sweet, but which played little role in the aforementioned Kirchspiel. This is exuberantly long, with suggestions of candied citrus and honey but not the caramelization displayed by the Kirchspiel. It should be worth following for 20-25 years.

209,Keller,Westhofener Scheurebe Trocken,"From 42 year old vines in the Morstein, Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Scheurebe trocken smells fascinatingly of mint; marzipan; candied orange and pink grapefruit rind; as well as black currant candies. A similarly differentiated palate exposition is enhanced by a glossy texture, while simultaneously a zesty pungency and streak of chalk offer counterpoint, leading to an interactive dynamic at once sustained and refreshingly mouth-cleansing. This should prove delightfully versatile over the next several years.

210,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese,"The 2009 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese originated in almost perfectly botrytized fruit, claims Keller, and certainly here is an instance where for all of the honeyed richness and spice lent by noble rot, a luscious and purely-concentrated sense of fresh fruit –suggestive of nectarine and pineapple – breaks through. That said, this lacks either the exuberant primary juiciness or the mineral dimension that renders the corresponding Spatlese so successful. Here, instead, the finish emphasizes honey, musk, and caramel, balanced in sweetness and impressively persistent, but not truly singing. This may well have more exciting phases in its evolution and would certainly be worth following for at least the better part of two decades.

211,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"For Keller’s 2009 Riesling trocken Von der Fels, picking did not take place until the last days of October. Here, the cyanic grip of peach kernel and apple pip as well as succulent peach fresh and piquant nuttiness go well beyond the corresponding basic bottling in complexity. A persimmon-like pungency and bittersweetness of orange peel add further interest to the sustained finish.

212,Keller,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Auslese,"Keller’s 2009 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Auslese (above Spatlese level, he is “allowed” by regional VDP regulations to employ the site name for a non-Riesling!) is, in all but name, a Beerenauslese, and packs the acidity (11 grams) of an Eiswein. The impression of pickled, spiced melon rind I had from the corresponding Spatlese is enhanced to the point of prickly pungency in the present instance. There is some superficiality to the sweetness here despite the wine’s prominent acidity, and the pineapple and peach manifest a glazing of honey and caramel as well as a dusting of spices and a squeeze of fresh lemon. I miss the lift and refreshment of the corresponding Spatlese, but perhaps that – as well as more knittedness – will come with time. I certainly don’t expect this long-finishing elixir to succumb to old age for at least 20 years.

The cool temperatures by the time he harvested his top sites in early November not only, claims Keller, offered the ideal circumstances for phenolic evolution and acid retention, but also for gentle extraction in the initial hours after harvest, when the fruit received the period of maceration that he believes is essential to getting at “the two-thirds of Riesling’s aromas are in its skin.” And as if the rest of the wines did not represent a sufficiently amazing performance, it concludes with no fewer than four Trockenbeerenauslesen (5 were planned, but the grapes left in Hubacker got rained-out), about which Keller claims not to know for sure whether it represents a record for his estate (though it definitely does for the period of his tenure, and – unbelievably – he repeated that record again in 2010). “Day in, day out we sorted grapes into the night,” relates Keller, but it should be borne in mind that the quantities of each of these T.B.A.s – as I have noted in each tasting note – remained minuscule. Keller is excited about 2009’s potential with Pinot as well, but surveying his finished 2008 Spatburgunder – all of which were moved solely by gravity, a forklift having served to elevate their assembled volumes for bottling – there is more than enough excitement generated by those as well to merit a search of the marketplace and to offer wine lovers a striking glimpse of the quality levels to which German Pinot Noir can successfully aspire.

213,Keller,Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese,"“I absolutely wanted to make a sweet Spatlese in my first vintage from Pettenthal,” enthuses Klaus-Peter Keller, and he stopped the fermentation in one tiny lot from his main harvest in that site to create a 2009 Niersteiner Pettenthal Riesling Spatlese. (The rest of this November 1 picking became the corresponding Grosses Gewachs.) Ripe peach and almost overripe musk melon and Persian melon waft from the glass and coat the palate with sappy profusion of fruits, mingled with orange liqueur and tinged with brown spices. The arrested fermentation has made this an entirely different sort of wine in more than merely the superficial sense than its Grosses Gewachs counterpart so that, by taste, one would never guess that in a sense they’re identical twins. While this is seductively long, it’s definitely for those with a sweet tooth, and lacks the delicacy or mineral distinction of the corresponding Kabinett that had been picked from these vines 21 days prior. It shares with a significant number of other 2009s from top-sites a sense of being almost too much of a good thing. I’ll be interested to see how it ages, but would speculate that it will probably be best enjoyed over the next 6-8 years and that waiting for it to shed its superficial sweetness would represent a fool’s errand.

214,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Rr,"Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling RR represents lightly-botrytized material that finished with 11 grams of residual sugar, which – although the wine certainly tastes dry – are no doubt suited to ameliorating the combined effects of a tendency for this iron-rich, chalky site to taste austerely mineral, and for botrytis to bring bitterness. (This wine harbors 13.5% alcohol, so it’s easy to see why Keller didn’t want to push the fermentation into trocken territory.) A persimmon-like pucker; pungent brown spices; and fruit pit piquancy all lead to a finish of formidable grip, its astringency alleviated by a flow of fresh peach, orange, and quince. In the final analysis, though, the seeds of botrytis and/or the alcohol rob the finish here of a certain measure of juiciness. I would plan on accommodating this Riesling’s piquant virtues over the next 3-5 years, though perhaps it will surprise me with its stamina.

215,Keller,Westhofener Riesling Trocken,"From young vines in the Morstein, Keller’s 2009 Westhofener Riesling trocken delivers a dusty expression of chalk in the nose, and its sense of stony palate suffusion – when combined with the chew of peach skin and piquancy of peach kernel – makes for an altogether more austere personality than that delivered by the different variations on chalk in which grew the corresponding Riesling von der Fels. Fortunately, there is both a subtle creaminess of texture and a juicy matrix of apple, peach, and lemon to somewhat alleviate the sense of austerity, even though this displays neither the cooling refreshment (Keller calls it “Trinkspass” or “fun-in-drinking”) nor the complex dynamic delivered by the ostensibly lesser “Fels” bottling. Follow this for up to half a dozen years.

216,Keller,Gruner Silvaner Trocken,"Keller’s basic 2009 Gruner Silvaner trocken (the inclusion of “Grun” in its official name intended in part as a stylistic indicator) presents a remarkably refreshing and buoyant personality for its variety, impressions enhanced by significant presence – indeed, near saturation – of residual CO2 . A crisply juicy expression of apple and Bosc pear is tinged with chalk and pungent green herbs, leading to an infectious if tart finish. Relish this wine’s versatility over the next 2-3 years. (Incidentally, it fermented down to within a tenth of a gram of residual sugar, something you won’t encounter often in white wine of any sort.)

218,Keller,Spatburgunder Trocken Fr (Auenberg),"Representing the contents of just three barriques (one of which was new) and headed for auction, Keller’s 2008 Spatburgunder trocken FR – from the Frauenberg – offers an accentuation of the bright juiciness that renders all three of his 2008 vintage Pinots memorable, and in addition a saline, saliva-inducing savor joins pit fruit, peat, and chalk accents to its succulent cherry and elderberry matrix. This marriage of richness and textural tenderness with refreshment and minerality should be worth following for at least a decade.  Around one-third of the fruit here was vinified with stems, and the additional complexity as well as the deft integration of supplemental tannin vis-a-vis Keller’s other two 2009 vintage Pinots – without sacrificing Riesling-like clarity – leaves little doubt that this approach has succeeded. Incidentally, Keller is contemplating grafting-over to the Pinot selection massale that informs this Frauenberg bottling some old, deeply-rooted Riesling vines he has been eyeing in Morstein.

219,Keller,Dalshemer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2008 Dalsheimer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs represents the contents of six barriques, one of which was new. Griotte, pistachio extract, and peat inform the nose and a delightfully slender, succulently juicy, glossy-textured palate. There is uncanny buoyancy and refreshment for a Pinot of such seamless, subtly sweet and seductive ripeness. That we’ve dropped half a degree in alcohol (to 13%) vis-a-vis Keller’s “S” bottling is hardly coincidental, because his principles of site selection and vine management are virtually the same for Pinot as for Riesling, namely to enhance ripeness while retarding sugar-accretion. Subtle notes of cherry pit, char, and chalk add to the stimulation of a lusciously lingering finish. Expect this refined Pinot to be worth following for at least 6-8 years, and probably longer.  (Keller’s evolution as a Pinot Noir grower has been too rapid for a relevant track record in bottle to have accumulated.)

Sappy, juicy, and (even at 13.5% alcohol) metaphorically coolly-fruited as well as herb-tinged and chalk-inflected, this finishes with refreshing persistence such as one would imagine, even expect, from a great Riesling-growing grower and region ? would, that is, if one had not tasted so many inelegant, over-blown, over-oaked, and underwhelming German Pinots. “What I really want to accomplish with Pinot,” opines Keller just seconds after I commit the above thoughts to tape, “is a red Riesling.” “Done,” I’d say.

221,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2008 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs – for considerable detail on whose terroir and history, consult my report in issue 185 – smells mysteriously musky in its evocation of narcissus, orchids, nut oils, and white truffle, which are accompanied by more predictable – even prosaic – but nonetheless lovely scents of pit fruits and citrus. Succulent, creamy, richly nutty and pit-fruited on the palate, it is saturated with the sort of diverse and in part ineffable intimations of things mineral as were encountered in the Hubacker. At the same time, there are tension and a sense of interplay as well as a sheer juicy generosity here reminiscent of the Kirchspiel. The finish is not only lusciously loaded with ripe white peach and piquant cardamom, white pepper, toasted almond, and lemon zest, but also as lip-smackingly saline as you are likely to encounter in any Riesling. Here is a union of intensity and elegance that I predict will stand the test of 12-15 years in bottle. Keller refers to the pristine transparency of a great Mosel Kabinett as “like glacial water,” and the same metaphor occurred to be in swallowing my first sip of 2008 Abtserde and of a very long day. 

""Two thousand eight is my vintage,"" proclaimed a delighted Klaus-Peter Keller, by which he meant a vintage designed to enhance the virtues of finesse, interplay Spiel, and elegance of which he has become an increasingly vocal partisan in recent years. The extra measure of refinement, flavor-delineation, and transparency as well as consistently lower alcohol that Keller is lately achieving in his dry Rieslings clearly point toward his enormous respect for the wines of Donnhoff and Schonleber on the Nahe, just as his Pinots – whose quality would shock most French or American tasters into a sudden recognition of Germany’s red wine potential – owe much to the inspiration of Chambolle’s Frederic Mugnier. (Keller regularly visits Burgundy to taste, study, and trade wines with growers. For more about his recent Pinots, see my report in issue 185.) When it comes to sweet wines – where he sets sights by the low-alcohol, feather-light, and uncannily-balanced results at Prum and Schaefer; Muller and Zilliken – Keller is certainly out of step with most of his neighbors and VDP Rhine compatriots, and in my experience has further to travel to reach his ideal. Whether his sites rather than he are a limitation in that genre – they could certainly not be much more different than steep, slate slopes – remains to be seen. But judging by the unfortunately few from among the latest crop of sweet wines that I tasted, these appear to represent a steady advance in quality similar to that perceived in the latest dry Rieslings and Pinots. (I also did not get to the estate’s non-Riesling whites this year.) Keller is not one to rest on received opinion, even when it comes to the widespread reverence among top-notch Riesling vintners for low yields and rigorous selection for maximally homogeneous grapes. “It’s meant well,” he insists, “but in my opinion can easily lead to wines that are too powerful, too concentrated, too one-dimensional, and no longer authentic: little Riesling monsters so hefty that they can no longer walk under their own steam.” There is no need to worry about the agility with which Keller’s wines walk his talk! Indeed, “dance” is the ideal word for what the best of these 2008s do on your palate. “When you tasted the grapes,” remarks Keller by way of explaining his harvest approach, “you realized that you just had to wait.

222,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The Keller 2008 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs smells exotically floral – like a walk through a tropical greenhouse – as well as of ripe peach, raw almond, and citrus. With almost dramatic purity of fruit and transparency to floral and saline, chalky, and crystalline mineral nuances, this sacrifices a bit of the richness and low tones of the Kirchspiel for the sake of delicacy. Almond cream and spirit-like inner-mouth aromatic suggestions – essence of cherry, white peach, and apricot, with subtly cyanic suggestions of their pits – add allure. This site reveals the strongest difference in character from 2007 – when its exemplification had strikingly tactile presence and grip – yet both vintages share inscrutable mineral mystery and the promise of enormous fascination as they evolve over the next decade or more.  

Two thousand eight is my vintage, proclaimed a delighted Klaus-Peter Keller, by which he meant a vintage designed to enhance the virtues of finesse, interplay Spiel, and elegance of which he has become an increasingly vocal partisan in recent years. The extra measure of refinement, flavor-delineation, and transparency as well as consistently lower alcohol that Keller is lately achieving in his dry Rieslings clearly point toward his enormous respect for the wines of Donnhoff and Schonleber on the Nahe, just as his Pinots – whose quality would shock most French or American tasters into a sudden recognition of Germany’s red wine potential – owe much to the inspiration of Chambolle’s Frederic Mugnier. (Keller regularly visits Burgundy to taste, study, and trade wines with growers. For more about his recent Pinots, see my report in issue 185.) When it comes to sweet wines – where he sets sights by the low-alcohol, feather-light, and uncannily-balanced results at Prum and Schaefer; Muller and Zilliken – Keller is certainly out of step with most of his neighbors and VDP Rhine compatriots, and in my experience has further to travel to reach his ideal. Whether his sites rather than he are a limitation in that genre – they could certainly not be much more different than steep, slate slopes – remains to be seen. But judging by the unfortunately few from among the latest crop of sweet wines that I tasted, these appear to represent a steady advance in quality similar to that perceived in the latest dry Rieslings and Pinots. (I also did not get to the estate’s non-Riesling whites this year.) Keller is not one to rest on received opinion, even when it comes to the widespread reverence among top-notch Riesling vintners for low yields and rigorous selection for maximally homogeneous grapes. “It’s meant well,” he insists, “but in my opinion can easily lead to wines that are too powerful, too concentrated, too one-dimensional, and no longer authentic: little Riesling monsters so hefty that they can no longer walk under their own steam.” There is no need to worry about the agility with which Keller’s wines walk his talk! Indeed, “dance” is the ideal word for what the best of these 2008s do on your palate. “When you tasted the grapes,” remarks Keller by way of explaining his harvest approach, “you realized that you just had to wait. By mid-November, you had a completely different set of aromas and flavors than before.”

223,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Auslese,"The 2008 Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Auslese smells of ripe honeydew and musk melon along with a Chartreuse-like intensity of herbal and floral essences. The palate impression is correspondingly elixir-like in its richness; its spirit-like, high-toned inner-mouth aromas; and its sheer intensity. Suggestions of vanilla cream add allure, while an impressive saline savor checks the sweetness, invigorates, and draws saliva. This displays sappy, juicy persistence that go beyond those exhibited in the corresponding gold capsule Spatlese (even though you might expect things to be the other way around), and ginger and white pepper add to the finishing stimulation.

224,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"Based more on air-drying of fruit than on a large share of botrytis grapes, he reports, Keller’s 2008 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese is fascinating, even curious, in its combination of strong caramelization and creaminess of texture with bright lemon, pineapple, and yellow plum character as well lightness and lift. This boasts (if that’s the right word!) an Eiswein-like near-17 grams of acidity yet doesn’t seer the palate or finish with any sense of shrillness. I suspect more complexity my emerge as this ages over the next decade – alluring and intriguing spice already become evident in the exceptionally long finish as it takes on air – and the springs for a dynamic two or more decades seem to be coiled to sufficient tension.

225,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Yellow plum with its pits, pungent parsnip, and grapefruit with pungent bitter-sweetness of zest mark the nose of Keller’s 2008 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs, and then come to the palate juicy and invigorating yet texturally rich and silken; suffused with nut oils, crushed stone and savory salinity; and displaying lift and refreshment that would have caused me to guess 12% alcohol, a full percent less than this Riesling in fact harbors. This epitomizes the poise and near-delicacy as well as dynamic interplay of fruit and mineral that 2008 can deliver, but at the same time the sheer richness it can attain. I suspect this will be worth following for a dozen or more years.

226,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Evocations of char and smoke, along with apricot and its kernels, on the nose of Keller’s 2008 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs lead to an expansive palate seemingly saturated with crushed stone; glycerin-rich and plush, yet shot through with efficacious citricity; and finishing with a cling of citrus oils, ginger, chalk dust, cocoa powder, and peat. “It’s that sticky clay component at the heart of the Morstein and the mother rock beneath that you’re tasting,” suggests Keller evocatively if perhaps controversially. The “little” Morstein (a.k.a. Westhofener Riesling) is more refreshing and no less dense, but certainly cannot pretend to the same depth or complexity as this. Like other current Keller Grosse Gewachse, I would plan to follow this over the coming 10-12 years, although one’s experience in that regard is necessarily limited to the much smaller number of – and different approach to – dry Rieslings at this estate during the 1990s. Incidentally, there are around 6,000 bottles of this year’s Kirchspiel and Hubacker Grosse Gewachse, whereas thanks to its restriction to old vines, there are only around 2,000 of this Morstein.

Suggestions of honey and nut brittle give the finish a confectionary aspect, yet the sweetness is still satisfactorily balanced, and saline, stony mineral nuances are discernable, even if the wine lacks the transparency of the best dry releases at this address. It should be most interesting to follow over the next 15 or more years.

The trick Keller is now accomplishing is clearly illustrated here: achieving generosity and charm in these chalky sites while avoiding severity or austerity. This should be a delight to follow over the next 6-8 years.

Here is one of those exceptional values in generic Riesling that can still be found at some of Germany’s most prestigious addresses, and it should remain delightful for at least 3-4 years.  Asked about his low price, Keller says “We need to make this affordable for students to drink at their parties. How else will we get the word out to new young drinkers?”

230,Keller,Riesling Von Der Fels,"From younger vines in the Kirchspiel and (in lesser proportions) Hubacker and Morstein, Keller’s 2008 Riesling trocken Von der Fels is scented and succulently brimming with ripe honeydew melon and fresh lime. Medium-bodied (at 12.5% alcohol) and mouth-coating, but with the lift as well as the transparency to chalky mineral nuances characteristic for the best wines of its vintage, this should remain gorgeous for at least 5-7 years.  Hints of apple pit synergize with mineral notes to enhance the sense of invigoration without engendering more than a pleasant hint of bitterness. Whether on account of its variety of soils (albeit from ostensibly lesser sites) or simply its more youthfully generous intentions, I find Keller’s basic generic Riesling both more interesting and fun for current consumption than is this admirable Von der Fels.

But judging by the unfortunately few from among the latest crop of sweet wines that I tasted, these appear to represent a steady advance in quality similar to that perceived in the latest dry Rieslings and Pinots. (I also did not get to the estate’s non-Riesling whites this year.) Keller is not one to rest on received opinion, even when it comes to the widespread reverence among top-notch Riesling vintners for low yields and rigorous selection for maximally homogeneous grapes. “It’s meant well,” he insists, “but in my opinion can easily lead to wines that are too powerful, too concentrated, too one-dimensional, and no longer authentic: little Riesling monsters so hefty that they can no longer walk under their own steam.” There is no need to worry about the agility with which Keller’s wines walk his talk! Indeed, “dance” is the ideal word for what the best of these 2008s do on your palate. “When you tasted the grapes,” remarks Keller by way of explaining his harvest approach, “you realized that you just had to wait. By mid-November, you had a completely different set of aromas and flavors than before.”

232,Keller,Riesling,"The Keller generic 2008 Riesling is very similar in vineyard sources to, but lacks the complexity of its trocken counterpart and (at 14 grams residual sugar) is halbtrocken in all but name. Luscious honeydew melon and herbs are suffused with a sensation of chalk and pit fruit and fruit pit chew and bitterness subtly add interest to a satisfyingly refreshing finish. In certain circumstances, the difference in residual sugar would prove to make quite a difference in culinary compatibility, and this bottling should prove versatile over the next 3-4 years.  

""Two thousand eight is my vintage,"" proclaimed a delighted Klaus-Peter Keller, by which he meant a vintage designed to enhance the virtues of finesse, interplay Spiel, and elegance of which he has become an increasingly vocal partisan in recent years. The extra measure of refinement, flavor-delineation, and transparency as well as consistently lower alcohol that Keller is lately achieving in his dry Rieslings clearly point toward his enormous respect for the wines of Donnhoff and Schonleber on the Nahe, just as his Pinots – whose quality would shock most French or American tasters into a sudden recognition of Germany’s red wine potential – owe much to the inspiration of Chambolle’s Frederic Mugnier. (Keller regularly visits Burgundy to taste, study, and trade wines with growers. For more about his recent Pinots, see my report in issue 185.) When it comes to sweet wines – where he sets sights by the low-alcohol, feather-light, and uncannily-balanced results at Prum and Schaefer; Muller and Zilliken – Keller is certainly out of step with most of his neighbors and VDP Rhine compatriots, and in my experience has further to travel to reach his ideal.

233,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The 2007 Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs smells of narcissus; a Chenin-like alliance of quince and snuffed candle wick; iodine and salts, along with other, ineffable mineral and animal elements. Fresh lime, tomatilla, and apricot on the palate are zesty, piquant, yet refreshing, and the finish here is at once invigorating yet cool and refined, not to mention shimmering in its elusively but strikingly mineral way. For elegance, clarity, interplay, and sheer mystery, this is hard to beat.  I would plan to follow this over the coming 12-15 years. 

Klaus-Peter Keller has acquired in time for the 2009 vintage a piece of Nierstein’s famous red Rhine shore slopes, but while he is obviously excited by the prospects he is anxious to remind me that “in the 15th Century, the bishops in Worms were not drinking wine from the Red Slope, but rather an aptes erden” – an allusion to the Abtserde vineyard, from which he began rendering dedicated Riesling in 2006 – “and they were certainly very savvy.” Keller considers 2007 “the most successful vintage in Germany for dry wine in a long while,” and when pressed admits he means an unprecedented vintage, since in his opinion he and his colleagues have been on a steep learning curve and were less well-positioned to take full advantage of past vintages that might have been theoretically ideally suited to Riesling trocken. Today, he says, he aims to “achieve slimness and elegance as well as ripeness.” Keller’s relentless pursuit of quality is encompassing longer cask maturation and later release of his best dry wines as well as experimentation in both red and sweet wine methodology. (Note that for all of the Keller 2007s I have tasted, there are also Auslesen from Hubacker and Morstein; a T.B.A. from Hubacker; and several other wines that I did not have chance to experience.) Judging by Keller’s three Pinots – tasted from barrel, and then from bottle – for him, at least, this is a vintage of exceptional potential in red as well.

234,Keller,Westhofener Apts Er de Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule,"The Keller 2007 Westhofener Abts.er.de Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese Gold Capsule (an auction lot) is even denser as well as sweeter than this year’s Kirchspiel T.B.A., but also displays more of the musky, carnal, exotically spicy side of botrytis to go with its honey, white raisin, quince and apricot preserves, malt, and caramel. Prodigious length and kaleidoscopic complexity as well as efficacious citricity render the sheer sweetness of the finish less over-riding than in Keller’s other botrytis super-concentrates of the vintage, as well as lending this an uncanny sense of buoyancy. That said, it is a wine strictly for those with patience and a longer life ahead of them than mine (or heirs who cherish great wine).

235,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2007 Riesling Abts.er.de Grosses Gewachs is labeled with the odd periods to thwart the authorities non-recognition of the Abtserde, a high-elevation, high active lime site officially part of the “single vineyard” Brunnenhauschen. (And, in fact, if you go do www.abtser.de – albeit with a period differently placed –you will find an informative site that intrepid German retail merchant and good friend of Keller’s Tino Seiwert erected.) If you thought there could not be more concentration or piquancy, nor a more pronounced minerality than already experienced with the Keller 2007 Grosse Gewachse, then you did not figure on what is in this glass! Zesty, smoky, faintly bitter intensity of grapefruit and pit fruits with their pits; pumpkin and winter squash with their toasted seeds; an almost ashen but also saline, savory, nutty expression of mineral extract:  all inform a Riesling of formidable finishing intensity, if not for now quite the clarity of interplay exhibited by the corresponding Morstein. This may just need longer to really strut its stuff; in any case, anyone lucky enough to latch onto some bottles should visit them at most sparingly during their first decade!

236,Keller,Dalsheimer Fr Spatburgunder,"The 2007 Spatburgunder FRauenberg – of which this year there are two barriques – originates from a vine selection Keller brought back from Burgundy in 1993, in the high, adamantly chalky Pinot parcel about which he is most enthusiastic. (The wine became “FR” because for a time the vineyard could not be named on the label.) High-toned cherry, cassis, almond, and praline aromas; a silken, glycerin-rich texture and invigoratingly tart edge to compliment the dark fruit’s fundamental sweetness; haunting, phernomic inner-mouth perfume; and a depth of marrow-like carnal, as well as chalky, alkaline mineral elements, make for one of the most promising young German Pinots I have tasted. (That stated, I am the first to confess my relative ignorance of recent developments outside of the predominantly Riesling-growing regions of the country). This builds to remarkable intensity, and will surely be worth following with keen interest for a decade or more.

237,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2007 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs smells flinty, pungent, and smoky – in short (and among other things) slightly reductive –  and needs time in the air to open up. Zesty grapefruit and juicy lime and peach mingle with alkaline, chalky, and smoky mineral elements on a dynamic palate which however lacks the singular combination of creaminess and energy exhibited by the Kirchspiel. The striking thing about this Hubacker is its sheer grip, not so much a savory as rather a sheer tactile intensity of finish which, however, never crosses to the unpleasant side of bitterness. Anticipate more than a dozen years of fascination, and make no assumptions as to whether this or the Kirchspiel will ultimately prove more complex or satisfying as that will in any event depend on the occasion and one’s predilections, not to mention their as yet inscrutable stages of evolution.

238,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The Keller 2007 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Grosses Gewachs combines a cool restraint of melon-like fruit and overtly chalky, saline, savory mineral tones with an only nominally contradictory conjunction of creaminess and tactile impingement of tart berry skin and herbal pungency. The nose on its own is Burgundian in its aura of crushed stone, toasted hazelnuts, citrus oil, and milled grain, but the echoes of these elements on the palate are accompanied by a lusciousness of fruit and almost subliminal sense of electric charge that definitely spell “Riesling.” This may not be more fun to drink right now than the “von der Fels” bottling – which is as Keller intended – but what a length there is here! Plan to follow this beauty for at least the next 12-15 years.

Impressively creamy in texture; seamlessly and single-mindedly ripe, it comes off as something like a hypothetical cross between un-oaked Barsac and a Mosel Beerenauslese. There is in theory more than enough acidity here – both on paper and palpably – but somehow for now I do not sense the dynamic that would take this wine to the next level and I find it calls quite a bit of attention to its own sweetness. It certainly gives every indication though of being a wine that will last for three decades, and obviously it could show many faces not to mention considerable evolution of character over such a long period. Still, I wouldn’t personally wouldn’t year to revisit it for more than a decade.

White raisin, marzipan, honey, peach preserves, lemon candy, and caramel saturate the palate in a nearly syrupy display that certainly points toward the wine’s improbably high dry extract as well as its high residual sugar. In respect to its analysis as well as to the dominance of very pure, dry botrytis, Keller compares this with the estate’s TBAs of 1990 and 1995. Once again, we have a wine that is memorably long, but highly confectionary, one that I would not want to revisit it for more than a decade, while counting on it’s being stable for 30 or more years.

241,Keller,Spatburgunder Trocken S,"The 2007 Spatburgunder trocken S combines freshness of red fruits with chocolate, fennel and leather. Like his other reds, it displays the sort of mysteriously musky, phernomic, and floral perfume as well as the silkiness of texture that make Pinot so alluring, and which I too seldom find in German examples. Cocoa powder, toasted nuts, and spices in the finish are deliciously counterpoised with invigorating tart berry skin and saline, chalky mineral notes. This lovely wine – in another class from its vintage predecessor – should be worth following for at least 6-8 years.

Gardenia, orange blossom, lime, and quince, as well as toasted almond and pistachio fill the nose; lusciously juicy fruit, inner-mouth floral perfume, and piquant nuttiness fill the palate; and a seemingly incongruous yet in practice not at all inharmonious alternation of nut cream and mocha with invigorating tart berry skin and citrus fill out a finish marked also by chalky and saline mineral suggestions.

(Note that for all of the Keller 2007s I have tasted, there are also Auslesen from Hubacker and Morstein; a T.B.A. from Hubacker; and several other wines that I did not have chance to experience.) Judging by Keller’s three Pinots – tasted from barrel, and then from bottle – for him, at least, this is a vintage of exceptional potential in red as well.

244,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese,"Harvested November 2 and, Keller insists, with only around 20% botrytis, the 2007 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese smells of black tea, heliotrope, quince jelly, white raisin, and over-ripe pear. Finer-grained and with more lift and primary juiciness than the corresponding gold capsule Spatlese, this introduces notes of quinine, tea, and chalk in the finish that help offset its sweetness. It should be worth following for two decades.

245,Keller,Riesling Rr,"The 2007 Riesling RR represents a 3,000 bottle lot from the most iron-rich portion of the chalky Kirchspiel that happened to finish with 12 grams residual sugar. While this is not the first time for a wine of this name and officially halbtrocken balance, Keller insists that he is not in principle unwilling to bottle as one of this top vineyard-designated wines something that transcends the legal sugar limit for trocken, should nature and his own sensitivity to balance point in that direction. And in fact, this year there is another, smaller cask of non-trocken Kirchspiel – whose contents I haven’t yet tasted – that Keller intends not to release until 2011 or 2012!  In the present instance, there is a lovely richness of peach and citrus, with well-integrated zest, palpable minerality, and hints of moth-ball and smoke. I (as a staunch defender of the idea “halbtrocken”) admit that there is not quite either the clarity or sheer length here that are displayed by the Kirchspiel Grosses Gewachs. But it should be fascinating to follow the evolution of this bitter-sweet finishing wine over the next 12-15 years.

246,Keller,Dalshemer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs,"Aged in six used barriques (all of outstanding provenance), Keller’s 2007 Dalsheimer Burgel Spatburgunder Grosses Gewachs – part of which was fermented in upright demi-muid – displays aromas ripe cherry with cocoa powder and coconut overtones from the barrel. There is a sweetness and purity of fruit as well as a plush of texture and depth of nutty and meaty character that reflect 35 year old vines (of diverse German clonal origin) planted in fossil mussel-chalk, with pleasant contrasting tartness of fruit skin and pungent spice. I slightly miss the sheer juiciness and at the same time haunting perfume and mineral dimensions more evident in the ostensibly lesser “S” bottling. Still, this too should be well worth watching for at least 6-8 years.

It displays more brightness – thanks to efficacious grapefruit citricity – than the corresponding B.A., but still treads very close to the syrupy, finish with both enormous length and sheer sweetness. That it will keep for decades I have little doubt.

248,Keller,Westhoferer Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese,"Smelling of pink grapefruit and blackcurrant and mint candies, Keller’s 2007 Westhofener Morstein Scheurebe Beerenauslese surprises – given the tendency of so many of the nobly sweet wines at this address – with a luscious grapefruit juiciness on a palate of considerable verve. Creamy and subtly oily, with an intense finish akin to sucking on sage, mint, and blackcurrant lozenges and on pink grapefruit zest, this nonetheless evinces a sense of refreshment. It would make a stunning – if no doubt very expensive – accompaniment for certain deserts, as well as making old bones in your cellar, a quarter century or more from now. Keller agrees that “fresh-fruited-ness” is an important aim, even in a concentrated nobly sweet wine, and here he has managed to retain an efficacious measure of it.

White raisin notes again underline the sense of sheer ripeness here. I just don’t see this as capturing the intended Mosel dance of fruit and acidity let alone the near disappearance of sweetness as an element in an intricate equation involving fruit and mineral. But about this Abtserde’s purity and sheer length there is no question, and I would not be surprised to see it flourish for the better part of two decades.

A finishing hint of white raisin underscores this wine’s sheer ripeness and suggests a flirtation with botrytis. A passionate and prodigiously knowledgeable devotee of Mosel Riesling, Keller is convinced of the ability to achieve the same sort of balance and expressiveness in his own sites, but I miss here the exuberant juiciness, transparency to mineral nuance, and uncanny irrelevance of high residual sugar that are among the hallmarks of great sweet Mosel Riesling. Certainly, though, this undeniably impressive wine will eventually diminish in its impression of sheer sweetness, and might surprise me in its expressivity, if given a decade or more in bottle.

A striking and intense nose of pink grapefruit, poached peach, honey, and brown spices leads to a palate in which the concentration of acidity is deployed to much more refreshing and invigorating effect, further enhanced by a saline note, all of which helps balance the wine’s finishing sweetness. Refined and pure – free of any smudgy fungal fingerprints – and with more oiliness and ethereal floral-honeyed sheer botrytis character than the results of the previous day’s picking (the “regular” BA), this amazing wine should be worth following for a quarter century.

Nectarine, yellow cherry, orange blossom, and honey inform the nose and a creamy, delicate palate. With wonderful lushness yet lightness, and a fascinating interplay of floral, citrus and pit fruit flavors, this displays precisely the sort of refinement, clarity, and flavor dynamic that a Riesling of such high residual sugar and positively dripping with ripe fruit and sweetly-perfumed flowers needs to achieve in order not to seem over-the-top.

259,Keller,Westhofener Abtserde Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"From parcels of tiny-berried vines he acquired a decade ago, Keller now presents his inaugural 2006 Westhofener Riesling Abtserde Grosses Gewachs, a wine which was sold only at auction. (“Abtserde” designates the highest in elevation, active lime, and historical renown of the acres that officially constitute the “single vineyard” Brunnenhauschen). Grapefruit laced with wood smoke, peach kernel, and white pepper and chalk give this Riesling brightness, piquancy, and almost sizzling mineral cast that results in a formidable finishing demonstration of sheer grip. A faint bit of gum-numbing phenolics is in evidence but the sheer intensity and strikingly aggressive personality of this wine do not make it seem out of place. It will be fascinating to follow this for at least 2-3 years, and if the pattern set by top dry Keller Riesling holds, it may prove worth holding for longer.

260,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Auslese 3 star Gold Capsule,"A 2006 Westhofener Moorstein Riesling Auslese gold capsule represents an early picking and the virginal harvest from a parcel of young vines whose fruit had all shriveled. Musk melon, honey, and brown spices inform a strikingly glossy, glycerin-rich, creamy-textured, very sweet but equally delicate and somewhat clearer Riesling than the corresponding Kirchspiel. It really clings with musky, spicy, honeyed richness and should be a candidate for at least 7-9 years aging.

261,Keller,Westhofener Morstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"The  2006 Westhofener Moorstein Riesling Grosses Gewachs fermented and aged in a 1,200 liter cask that Keller particularly likes, but for which his volume of Moorstein in many years is insufficient. It seems indeed as though the barrel accentuates in a positive way the saline, smoky natural tendencies of Riesling in this site, which along with notes of nutmeg accent the ripe pear fruit. Quite opulent and full on the palate, this then slims down to a refined, predominantly mineral (smoky, saline, stony) finish. Along with the aforementioned Grosses Gewachs bottlings, I would follow this over the coming 3-5 years.

262,Keller,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese,"The 2006 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese perfectly demonstrates the proclivity of this grape for shriveling and for retaining acidity, particularly considering Keller had only a few days prior to harvest planned to vinify a Spatlese! Grilled pineapple, grapefruit, wood smoke, cinnamon, coconut, and honey are laced with a slightly fungal aura of botrytis. A clear, pure, palate impression of dried apricots macerated in lemon, pineapple juice, and honey leads into a finish of almost overwhelming sweetness and yet rapier penetration. This will need at least half a dozen years in the cellar and has potential for twice as long a positive evolution.

263,Keller,Dalsheimer Fr Spatburgunder,"The two barrique’s worth of 2006 Dalsheimer FR Spatburgunder originated in a high, chalky parcel which Keller thinks may reflect ideal circumstances for Pinot Noir in the future, even if historically Riesling – forget Pinot – wouldn’t always ripen. A deep meaty richness and overt chalkiness suggest a more interesting glimpse at Pinot’s mysteries than the overt fruitiness of Keller’s other two bottlings.

264,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Auslese 3 star Gold Capsule,"When he picked it, Keller imagined that what would become his 2006 Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Auslese gold capsule was going to be a “normal” Auslese, but he had far underestimated the shriveled concentration of berries in the clusters. Over-ripe pear, marzipan, and a faintly horseradish-like note in the nose set the scene for a palate of candied sweetness though also remarkable creaminess of texture and near weightlessness. Pure and intense but overwhelmingly sweet in finish, this will need years to come into better balance.

265,Keller,Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Grosses Gewachs,"Keller’s 2006 Dalsheimer Hubacher Riesling Grosses Gewachs is scented with raw almond, honey, and peach kernel. It offers a correspondingly bitter-sweet and piquant as well as creamy-textured palate impression and finish, its enhanced body and honeyed richness as well as bitterness reflecting the presence of botrytis by the time it was harvested – as the last of this year’s dry wines.

266,Keller,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese 3 star Gold Capsule,"Keller’s “three star” 2006 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Auslese gold capsule represents a later picking of Kirchspiel that totaled a mere 300 half bottles. Ethereal honeyed and floral manifestations of pure botrytis are mingled with nippy, horseradish like pungency in the nose. Opulent, sweet, honeyed, and peachy, this doesn’t seem to know where or how to hide so much residual sugar, although its combination of opulent texture and delicate near-weightlessness are impressive. It requires extended cellaring to begin to achieve a more balanced sweetness.

269,Keller,Riesling R R Trocken,"The 2006 Riesling R.R. trocken comes from young vines in lower portions of the Kirchspiel that are high in iron content and thus red in color. Unlike Keller’s two less-expensive dry Riesling, this is vinified in cask. Fresh red raspberry, sweetly-perfumed flowers, and salted pistachio dominate this piquant, pungently smoky, mineral, and impressively concentrated Riesling. Hints of resin and lanolin from the large but youthful barrel make themselves evident in the finish, and this lacks quite the clarity or lip-smacking juiciness of the von der Fels bottling.

Fashioned in a nation known for its single varietal wines, this is a blend of Scheurebe (the majority of the blend according to the estate), Rieslaner, and Huxelrebe (the exact blend was not revealed and the winemaker expects to change it year to year). It reveals a strange blend of passion fruit (Scheurebe) and creamed herbal tea (ripe Rieslaner) aromas that are followed by a medium-bodied, exotic personality. Papaya, passion fruit, apricots, white peaches, and yellow plums make up this soft, satin-textured effort’s flavor profile. It should be drunk over the next 8-9 years.

In Germany, considerable criticism has been aimed at The Wine Advocate, other US wine publications, as well as American consumers and importers that Germany’s dry (trocken) wines do not receive the respect, attention, and reviews that they deserve. In short, if one listens to the commentary, it would appear that we are wearing blinders, believing that the entire wine world is capable of producing great dry wines except Germany, relegating Deutschland to the crafting of off-dry and sweet wines. In my estimation, this misses three key points: 1) Germany’s finest terroirs are typically dedicated to the production of wines with some residual sugar; 2) there is a magical sweet/tart juxtaposition married with purity that exists in this nation’s finest off-dry and sweet Rieslings that no other region on Earth has been able to reproduce; and 3) the overwhelming majority of trockens are lean, mean, dusty, and tart.

287,Domaine Leroy,Silvaner Trocken S,"Keller’s 2007 Silvaner trocken S grew in a former quarry (from which the site takes its name, Steingrube) and there indeed seems to be a palpable sense of chalk and stone about what is in the glass, along with fresh apple, cherry (with piquant pips and pits); a glossy, rich texture that steers clear of fat; and a long, satisfyingly refreshing and intriguingly mineral finish. This fine value should prove highly versatile at least through 2011.   

Klaus-Peter Keller has acquired in time for the 2009 vintage a piece of Nierstein’s famous red Rhine shore slopes, but while he is obviously excited by the prospects he is anxious to remind me that “in the 15th Century, the bishops in Worms were not drinking wine from the Red Slope, but rather an aptes erden” – an allusion to the Abtserde vineyard, from which he began rendering dedicated Riesling in 2006 – “and they were certainly very savvy.” Keller considers 2007 “the most successful vintage in Germany for dry wine in a long while,” and when pressed admits he means an unprecedented vintage, since in his opinion he and his colleagues have been on a steep learning curve and were less well-positioned to take full advantage of past vintages that might have been theoretically ideally suited to Riesling trocken. Today, he says, he aims to “achieve slimness and elegance as well as ripeness.” Keller’s relentless pursuit of quality is encompassing longer cask maturation and later release of his best dry wines as well as experimentation in both red and sweet wine methodology. (Note that for all of the Keller 2007s I have tasted, there are also Auslesen from Hubacker and Morstein; a T.B.A. from Hubacker; and several other wines that I did not have chance to experience.) Judging by Keller’s three Pinots – tasted from barrel, and then from bottle – for him, at least, this is a vintage of exceptional potential in red as well.

White raisin notes again underline the sense of sheer ripeness here. I just don’t see this as capturing the intended Mosel dance of fruit and acidity let alone the near disappearance of sweetness as an element in an intricate equation involving fruit and mineral. But about this Abtserde’s purity and sheer length there is no question, and I would not be surprised to see it flourish for the better part of two decades.

289,Domaine Leroy,Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese Gold Capsule,"The Keller 2007 Westhofener Kirchspiel Riesling Spatlese is redolent of maracuja and pineapple; opulently ripe to the edge of syrupy; and (not surprisingly, given its mere 7.5% alcohol) delicate. A finishing hint of white raisin underscores this wine’s sheer ripeness and suggests a flirtation with botrytis. A passionate and prodigiously knowledgeable devotee of Mosel Riesling, Keller is convinced of the ability to achieve the same sort of balance and expressiveness in his own sites, but I miss here the exuberant juiciness, transparency to mineral nuance, and uncanny irrelevance of high residual sugar that are among the hallmarks of great sweet Mosel Riesling. Certainly, though, this undeniably impressive wine will eventually diminish in its impression of sheer sweetness, and might surprise me in its expressivity, if given a decade or more in bottle.

291,Domaine Leroy,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese Gold Capsule,"The 2006 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese gold capsule was picked a day later than the “regular” Beerenauslese and destined for auction. A striking and intense nose of pink grapefruit, poached peach, honey, and brown spices leads to a palate in which the concentration of acidity is deployed to much more refreshing and invigorating effect, further enhanced by a saline note, all of which helps balance the wine’s finishing sweetness. Refined and pure – free of any smudgy fungal fingerprints – and with more oiliness and ethereal floral-honeyed sheer botrytis character than the results of the previous day’s picking (the “regular” BA), this amazing wine should be worth following for a quarter century.

Klaus-Peter Keller says his grapes weren’t soft yet when the August rain hit, and he harvested late by local standards – from 6th-26th of October – by which time the nights were cool, which in his opinion preserved the aromas, warded-off botrytis, and allowed him to achieve normal crop levels, expressive ripeness and dry wines in the 11.9-13% alcohol range.

With a fruitcake-like aromatic melange of white raisin, fig, brown spices, and marzipan, mingled with a faintly fungal manifestation of botrytis, this overwhelmingly opulent yet remarkably pure, clear, and refined elixir pours on honey and peach nectar through a long finish, while retaining the spice, dried fruits, and almond paste promised on the nose and adding a note of lemon candy. Hold it for ten years, and expect it to then evolve positively for at least a further decade. Keller’s dedication to Rieslaner dates from his Pfalz apprenticeship with Hans-Gunter Schwarz.

Nectarine, yellow cherry, orange blossom, and honey inform the nose and a creamy, delicate palate. With wonderful lushness yet lightness, and a fascinating interplay of floral, citrus and pit fruit flavors, this displays precisely the sort of refinement, clarity, and flavor dynamic that a Riesling of such high residual sugar and positively dripping with ripe fruit and sweetly-perfumed flowers needs to achieve in order not to seem over-the-top.

(“Abtserde” designates the highest in elevation, active lime, and historical renown of the acres that officially constitute the “single vineyard” Brunnenhauschen). Grapefruit laced with wood smoke, peach kernel, and white pepper and chalk give this Riesling brightness, piquancy, and almost sizzling mineral cast that results in a formidable finishing demonstration of sheer grip. A faint bit of gum-numbing phenolics is in evidence but the sheer intensity and strikingly aggressive personality of this wine do not make it seem out of place. It will be fascinating to follow this for at least 2-3 years, and if the pattern set by top dry Keller Riesling holds, it may prove worth holding for longer.

Musk melon, honey, and brown spices inform a strikingly glossy, glycerin-rich, creamy-textured, very sweet but equally delicate and somewhat clearer Riesling than the corresponding Kirchspiel. It really clings with musky, spicy, honeyed richness and should be a candidate for at least 7-9 years aging.

It seems indeed as though the barrel accentuates in a positive way the saline, smoky natural tendencies of Riesling in this site, which along with notes of nutmeg accent the ripe pear fruit. Quite opulent and full on the palate, this then slims down to a refined, predominantly mineral (smoky, saline, stony) finish. Along with the aforementioned Grosses Gewachs bottlings, I would follow this over the coming 3-5 years.

299,Domaine Leroy,Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese,"The 2006 Monsheimer Silberberg Rieslaner Beerenauslese perfectly demonstrates the proclivity of this grape for shriveling and for retaining acidity, particularly considering Keller had only a few days prior to harvest planned to vinify a Spatlese! Grilled pineapple, grapefruit, wood smoke, cinnamon, coconut, and honey are laced with a slightly fungal aura of botrytis. A clear, pure, palate impression of dried apricots macerated in lemon, pineapple juice, and honey leads into a finish of almost overwhelming sweetness and yet rapier penetration. This will need at least half a dozen years in the cellar and has potential for twice as long a positive evolution.

Over-ripe pear, marzipan, and a faintly horseradish-like note in the nose set the scene for a palate of candied sweetness though also remarkable creaminess of texture and near weightlessness.

308,Domaine Leroy,Weisser Burgunder Trocken S,"Keller’s 2006 Weisser Burgunder trocken S – vinified and matured in casks of varying size and age – displays some of the classic Pinot Blanc virtues: apply fruit, hazelnut richness and a creamy texture, yet juiciness and refinement, with a clear, pure, if faintly bitter finish.

309,Domaine Leroy,Spatburgunder Trocken S,"Keller is entranced with Burgundy – where he often visits and tastes – and very serious about his own potential with Pinot Noir, as witness (from cask) a 2006 Spatburugnder trocken S that exhibits a concentrated core of cassis and cooked red raspberry fruit, pungent spice, but also a rather blatant youthful overlay of toasty, lanolin- and caramel-tinged oak. Time will tell, and I shall report in further detail on Keller’s Pinot progress at a later date.

312,Domaine Leroy,Beerenauslese Pius,"The 2003 Beerenauslese Pius is fascinating. Fashioned in a nation known for its single varietal wines, this is a blend of Scheurebe (the majority of the blend according to the estate), Rieslaner, and Huxelrebe (the exact blend was not revealed and the winemaker expects to change it year to year). It reveals a strange blend of passion fruit (Scheurebe) and creamed herbal tea (ripe Rieslaner) aromas that are followed by a medium-bodied, exotic personality. Papaya, passion fruit, apricots, white peaches, and yellow plums make up this soft, satin-textured effort’s flavor profile. It should be drunk over the next 8-9 years.

313,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Gold-colored and revealing a nose of passion fruit, orange zest, and spices, the 2002 Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese (gold capsule) is a viscous, hugely thick wine. Reminiscent of Alois Kracher’s super-rich TBAs from Austria, this medium to full-bodied effort has massive power, excellent balance, and loads of sweet apricot, passion fruit, and honey flavors. Projected maturity: 2015-2040+.  

In Germany, considerable criticism has been aimed at The Wine Advocate, other US wine publications, as well as American consumers and importers that Germany’s dry (trocken) wines do not receive the respect, attention, and reviews that they deserve. In short, if one listens to the commentary, it would appear that we are wearing blinders, believing that the entire wine world is capable of producing great dry wines except Germany, relegating Deutschland to the crafting of off-dry and sweet wines. In my estimation, this misses three key points: 1) Germany’s finest terroirs are typically dedicated to the production of wines with some residual sugar; 2) there is a magical sweet/tart juxtaposition married with purity that exists in this nation’s finest off-dry and sweet Rieslings that no other region on Earth has been able to reproduce; and 3) the overwhelming majority of trockens are lean, mean, dusty, and tart.

314,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Approaching maturity, Leroy's 1993 Chambertin Grand Cru is a magical wine, wafting from the glass with complex aromas of dark berry fruit, peonies and wilted rose petals, mingled with hints of musk, sweet soil tones and orange rind. Full-bodied, deep and layered, it's still tightly wound, with a racy spine of acidity and fine, powdery tannins framing its core of intensely concentrated fruit. Concluding with a long, perfumed finish, it comes across as a somewhat more brooding, austere stylistic cousin to the stunning 2001 Chambertin—another year when Leroy crafted some of the wines of the vintage.",1993 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 88

Full-bodied and deep, it's layered and concentrated, with a seamless, multidimensional profile, bright animating acids and ripe, powdery tannins. Long and resonant, this is an incipiently dramatic but youthfully tightly wound Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will reward extended bottle age with remarkable aromatic range and textural sumptuousness.

This, too, has turned out very well, though this year I'm inclined to prefer the Beaux Monts.",2017 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 94
355,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is showing especially well this year, bursting with notes of raspberries, cherries, woodsmoke, grilled squab and rose petals. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with succulent acids, powdery tannins and an ample core of sapid fruit, concluding with a long and precise finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 94
356,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Bursting with scents of rose petals, raspberries, cassis, spices and sweet soil tones, the 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes once again lives up to its name this year, its rounded and enveloping attack segueing into a medium to full-bodied palate that's supple and layered, its fine structuring tannins entirely cloaked in succulent, sapid fruit.",2017 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 94
357,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is superb, and—as is often the case—I would argue that this is the finest of Domaine Leroy's communal bottlings this year. Opening in the glass with exquisite aromas of rose hips, raspberries, warm spices and sweet red fruits, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with racy acids and a long, mineral-driven finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 94
358,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Aromas of cassis and plums mingle with notions of pencil lead, woodsmoke and rich soil tones, introducing the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu, a medium to full-bodied, velvety and succulent wine, with good depth at the core and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long finish. This is a comparatively giving, expressive rendition of Santenots, a cuvée that can often be a little introverted in its youth—indeed, I sometimes think it as the Clos Vougeot of the Côte de Beaune chez Leroy—though it still possesses plenty of upside.",2017 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 94
359,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Exquisite aromas of wild berry fruit, smoked duck, exotic spices, peonies and loamy soil preface the 2017 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine with supple and powdery tannins, succulent balancing acids and a long, perfumed finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP 94
360,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berry fruit, spices and sweet soil tones that are discretely framed by a deft touch of new oak, Leroy's 2017 Pommard Les Vignots is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with powdery tannins, lively acids and good concentration at the core, concluding with a long and delicately carnal finish. This high-altitude, south-facing site always produces an ethereal, precise wine that's worlds away from Pommard's stereotype.",2017 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 94
361,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Once again, Bize-Leroy opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges. The wine is showing well, opening up to reveal notes of cassis, grilled squab, rose hips and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, layered and attractively concentrated, energetic palate structured around fine and powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid.",2017 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 94
362,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chambertin Grand Cru is a monument for the ages. Wafting from the glass with aromas of dark berries, orange rind, grilled meats, licorice and peony, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and immensely concentrated, with huge volume and amplitude, deep and multi-dimensional at the core, yet all the while remaining precise, vibrant and ineffably complete. Both the inevitable power and the essential elegance of Chambertin are fully realized in this timeless bottle. Whether this or the 2015 rendition is superior will be the subject for a debate that could last the better part of a century, yet the 2016's obvious stylistic affinity is with the 2010 vintage.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
363,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"One of the high points of the vintage, the 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru captivates the olfactory senses with its striking bouquet of rose petals, citrus rind, cassis, raspberries, dark chocolate and sweet Asian spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, utterly complete and multidimensional, with satiny structuring tannins, immense concentration without the weight and a long, electric and perfumed finish. This is a magisterial achievement and a benchmark against which other wines may be measured.",2016 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 94
364,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru is one of the more reticent wines in the cellar, reluctantly unfurling in the glass to reveal a profound bouquet of wild berries, rose petal, blood orange and ineffable savory nuances. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, incredibly deep and multidimensional, with extraordinary density without the weight and incredibly fine-grained tannins—but while this Musigny displays no structural asperity, so much is patently held in reserve that it's hard to read today. With bottle age, it's easy to imagine that this might end up being the finest of the Domaine Leroy's otherworldly 2016s, but over a decade's patience will be required.",2016 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 94
365,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The extraordinary 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru soars from the glass with an irresistible bouquet of sweet dark fruits, baking chocolate, rose petals and exotic spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with incredible depth and volume at the core. Velvety and textural on the attack, the wine's powdery tannins are cloaked in a gourmand core of fruit, yet the lavish, expansive finish is beautifully controlled and precise for all its drama. Only in a range as exalted as this could Leroy's 2016 Richebourg receive so parsimonious a score.",2016 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 94
366,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is brilliant, and one of the high points both of the portfolio and this great Côte de Nuits vintage. The wine unfurls in the glass with a captivating but youthfully reserved bouquet of rose petals, violets, blood orange, cherries and cassis, with only hints of the savory forest floor and spice to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and immensely concentrated, with an animating line of acidity that is classic Latricières, framed by exceptionally fine, powdery tannins, its finish long and unerringly precise.",2016 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
367,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is one of the most exciting wines in the portfolio this year, unfurling in the glass with a beautifully defined bouquet of pomegranate, rose petal, raspberries, red plums and sweet spices, with only hints at the savory nuances to come. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and searingly intense, with a deep, layered mid-palate that's both more multidimensional and more structured than the Chambolle Fremières—a feat that had scarcely seemed possible. The finish is long, fine-grained and intensely chalky. In this frost-ravaged vintage, Bize-Leroy has produced a wine that tastes like the distilled essence of Chambolle Charmes.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 94
368,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is just as stunning as the Brûlées, but more reserved and serious, unfurling in the glass with a less extravagant bouquet of cassis, plums, dark chocolate, grilled squab, subtle spices and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with striking amplitude and dimension, displaying a deep, searingly concentrated core that's framed by fine, powdery tannins. And if the Beaux Monts' finish isn't as expansive as the Brûlées', it's even longer and more penetrating. What's clear is that although the domaine's two Vosne premier crus touch, the wines themselves could hardly be more distinct.",2016 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
369,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is striking, bursting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, grilled game, dark chocolate, cinnamon and violets. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and searingly concentrated, with a bottomless core of fruit, rich but supple structuring tannins, and a long, muscular finish. Above all, however, this wine is thrillingly vibrant, endowed with energy that evokes the 2010 rendition. It will need time, certainly, and it remains one of the more structural wines in the portfolio; but, if anything, it's less tight-knit than the 2015.",2016 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 94
370,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru offers up a rich, brooding bouquet of cassis, wild berries, dark chocolate, incense and pencil shavings that are still quite youthfully reserved. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and layered, with immense concentration at the core, a rich chassis of structuring tannins and a long, powerful finish. Beautifully complete, this Clos Vougeot is predictably backward and tight-knit, and I suspect it will require more patience than any other wine in the cellar this year.",2016 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 94
371,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a wine that speaks to the senses more than the intellect, soaring from the glass with aromas of ripe cassis, cherries and blackberries that mingle with lifted top-notes of rose petal and exotic spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and gourmand, cascading over the tongue with wave after wave of succulent, satiny fruit that entirely cloaks its satiny tannins, before concluding with a lavish, expansive but unerringly precise finish. I confess to a decided weakness for this Vosne-Romanée premier cru, a wine that's among the most viscerally thrilling in the Leroy portfolio.",2016 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 94
372,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of citrus oil, beeswax, smoky pear, toasted nuts and an exotic top-note of candied angelica introduce the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, searingly concentrated wine that's structured around chewy dry extract more reminiscent of red wine, than white wine. Deep, concentrated and tight-knit, this is a stunning Corton-Charlemagne but it will require extended bottle age to attain its true plenitude of expression.",2016 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 94
373,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"More reserved than the Vignerondes, the 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots unfurls in the glass with a brooding bouquet of wild berries, rich soil tones, Asian spices, dark chocolate and grilled game. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and broad, with considerable reserves of concentration and extract, framed by a large-scaled chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the long, stony finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 94
374,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a particular success, unwinding with a captivating bouquet of rose petal, raspberries, orange rind and rich spices that are beautifully defined and multifaceted. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and fleshy, with satiny tannins that lend it a more than usually seductive aspect, though still underpinned by the bright line of acidity that always lend this wine is structure, concluding with a long and pure finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
375,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is deep and brooding, unwinding in the glass with notes of wild blueberries, pencil lead, burning embers, cassis and grilled meat. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a broad-shouldered and firm but fine-grained chassis of structuring tannin fleshed out with deep reserves of fruit and savory nuance. The finish is long and sapid. As usual, this is one of the less immediate wines in the range and will need some time.",2016 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 95
376,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is glorious, soaring from the glass in a blaze of red cherries, plums, rose petals and spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with incredible concentration without weight, rich but satiny structuring tannin and a long, vibrant finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 95
377,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes bursts from the glass with expressive aromas of rose petals, berries and plums, complemented by savory hints of grilled meats. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and open-knit, with supple, fine-grained structuring tannins, a succulent core of fruit, and a long, expansive finish. This is an elegant and giving Combottes that's very true to type.",2016 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 95
378,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"This year, Bize-Leroy once again opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the wine is incredible, unfurling in the glass with aromas of dark berries, pencil lead, dried flowers, rose hip and rich soil tones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, immensely concentrated and intense, with a deep, multidimensional core, vibrant acids and a long, resonant finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 95
379,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"There are two barrels of the other-worldly 2016 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a wine that wafts from the glass with a stunning bouquet of raspberries, plums, smoked duck, spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and layered, with stunning concentration, powdery tannins and a long, pungently perfumed finish. It's a village wine that surpasses plenty of lesser producers' grands crus.",2016 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP 95
380,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Bursting from the glass with an arresting bouquet of rose petals, raspberries, dried flowers and dark chocolate, the 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is medium to full-bodied, satiny and immensely concentrated, its fine tannins are entirely hidden in a deep core of fruit, its finish long, pure and unmistakably mineral. It's quintessentially Chambolle, but this singular vintage is unusually intense, even by Leroy's standards.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 95
381,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes offers up aromas of wild berries, spices, dried flowers and sweet soil tones, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional palate, its delicately chalky tannins cloaked in a fleshy core of fruit that lives up to the climat's name, concluding with a long and perfumed finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 95
382,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Aromas of spicy wild berries, grilled meat and forest floor introduce the superb 2016 Pommard Les Vignots, a medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated wine with a deep, tight-knit core, powerful structuring tannins and a lovely line of animating acidity. More reserved than the gourmand 2015 rendition, this will be less approachable out of the gates and is more obviously defined by its high-altitude site.",2016 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 95
383,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2010 Chambertin Grand Cru is spectacular, bursting from the glass with a youthful bouquet of rich red and black fruits, burning embers, rose petal and licorice, subtly framed by a discreet application of new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with satiny tannins, a concentrated core of fruit and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Of all Leroy's 2010s, this demands the most additional cellaring, and I suspect it will also prove to be the longest lived. This monumental wine is a reminder that Chambertin is not the greatest of the commune's grands crus by virtue of its power but rather thanks to its ineffable completeness and elegance.",2010 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
384,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2010 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is spectacular, unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of wild red berries, potpourri, smoked duck and exotic spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with utterly suave structuring tannins and a superb line of acidity that lends the wine immense length and focus—in contrast to the broader, more expansive and gourmand Richebourg served alongside it. This is a real highlight of the 2010 portfolio and I suspect it is holding a great deal in reserve to be revealed over the coming decade and beyond.",2010 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
385,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Notes of lemon oil, nutmeg and sesame mingle with lime zest and white truffle in a complex mélange, introducing the 2010 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firmly structured, with immense concentration, tension and substance. Like the whites from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it, this Corton-Charlemagne exhibits a phenolic frame that wouldn't be out of place in a red wine, and it requires the best part of another decade of cellaring.",2010 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
386,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Notes of smoked duck, rich black fruits and Asian spices introduce the 2010 Richebourg Grand Cru, an ample, full-bodied wine with a gourmand core of fruit that largely conceals its satiny tannins, underpinned by tangy balancing acids. The finish is long and sapid. The Richebourg is more dramatic and expansive than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, but it isn't quite as focused and elegant.",2010 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
387,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2010 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is already comparatively expressive today, wafting from the glass with aromas of red berries, cassis, incense and musk, with bass notes of sweet grilled meat emerging with time in the glass. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and bright, built around a beautiful line of racy acidity and framed by fine-grained, delicately chalky tannins. It's very intense and long.",2010 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
388,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is very special, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of raw cocoa, Asian spices, ripe plums, rose petal and potpourri. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and perfumed, with a gourmand, layered mid-palate, melting tannins and a long, beautifully delineated finish. In recent vintages, I've tended to prefer the Domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant to its Richebourg, but in 1999 it's the latter that has the edge.",1999 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
389,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 1999 Chambertin Grand Cru is a rich, dramatic wine, bursting with aromas of sweet cassis, rich soil, cedary new oak and incense. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and textural, with a firm chassis of structuring tannins and a long, stony finish. This Chambertin isn't as seamless or weightlessly intense as more recent vintages from Domaine Leroy, but it's a very exciting wine.",1999 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
390,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"A rich, dramatic wine, the 1999 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru bursts with aromas of caramelized citrus, pear, verbena flowers and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and powerful, with chewy extract and structure, displaying immense concentration and stony depth. It's still shockingly youthful, so I may be underestimating it, but I didn't find it quite as complete or profound as the two 1999s from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it.",1999 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
391,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 1999 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru was the one wine in the range that seemed a little fatigued, offering up aromas of dried red berries, candied peel, sweet spices and camphor, with a light framing of new oak still in evidence. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, firm and chalky, without the multidimensional completeness and seamless integration that the domaine so routinely attains.",1999 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
392,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is one of the most magical wines to be found in Burgundy in this vintage, soaring from the glass with a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, featuring notes of rose petal, blood orange, potpourri and bright berry fruit, with only hints of the savory complexity to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is deep, full-bodied and extraordinarily multifaceted, with immense concentration, incredible energy and a long, resonating finish. Both more elegant and more reserved than the gloriously dramatic Richebourg that followed it, this is a profound Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",2015 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
393,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Chambertin Grand Cru soars from the glass with a profound bouquet of cassis, cherry, raspberry, rose hip, grilled meat, spice and cedar. On the palate, the full extent of this wine's stunning amplitude and depth—and the reserves of energy that lie behind them—defy description. That a wine of such scale and concentration should be so seamless and complete is hard to fathom. The ecstatic commentary scribbled in my notebook concludes with the phrase ""essence of wine.""",2015 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
394,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The utterly profound 2015 Musigny Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy, the crowning achievement to an extraordinary portfolio and a wine that brought tears to my eyes, wafts from the glass with a deep bouquet of black raspberry, cherry, rose petal and spice. On the palate, the wine is bottomless and multidimensional, with satiny tannins and fruit of crystalline purity, so utterly harmonious and structurally complete as to border on the ineffable—and certainly to exhaust any tired superlatives. The finish is incredibly penetrating and persistent.",2015 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 95
395,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is an extraordinary wine that captures all the lavishness and power of this great grand cru, soaring from the glass with a deep bouquet of ripe black fruits, exotic spice, licorice and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is huge and multidimensional, with extraordinary concentration and mid-palate depth, vibrant and full of energy despite its imposing scale. Such is the intensity of its finish that neither swallowing nor expectoration have any immediate impact: it's as if the wine's still there. While this will never have the complexity or elegance of the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, it represents the essence of Richebourg.",2015 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
396,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is one of the highlights in Domaine Leroy's formidable portfolio, soaring from the glass with an extroverted but almost ineffably complex bouquet of ripe blackberry, peony, game bird and wood smoke. On the palate, the wine is extraordinarily velvety and grand, with a lavish attack, a layered and multidimensional mid-palate and a long, saline finish—scintillatingly energetic despite the ripe, dramatic profile so typical of this climat. If there were ever any doubts about whether Aux Brûlées is one of Vosne-Romanée's finest premier crus, this bottle will dispel them. For now, the wine hasn't shut down, and I expect it to offer a very broad drinking window.",2015 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 95
397,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is spectacular, wafting from the glass with notes of rose petal, black cherry, cassis, rich spices and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is silky, elegant and multidimensional—a world away from the assertive structure of its near-neighbor Clos de la Roche—with silky tannins, superb concentration and a vibrant, saline finish. For all its intensity of flavor, this Latricières is a delicate, transparent wine that fully realizes this grand cru's potential.",2015 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
398,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a wine for the ages, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of incense, smoky black fruits, red cherry and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firm at the core, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins, excellent concentration and a firm, structural finish. Of all the Domaine Leroy 2015s, this—along with the Clos de la Roche—will demand the most extended cellaring.",2015 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 95
399,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Like the Clos de Vougeot, the 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is built for the ages, opening in the glass with a bouquet of red-black berries, cherries, wood smoke, pencil shavings and incipient suggestions of soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and firm, with an ample and assertive chassis of chalky tannins, formidable power and concentration, with a long, grippy finish. This is cut from very different cloth than the Musigny that preceded it in our tasting, but it is taut rather than hard: the only missing ingredient is time.",2015 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 95
400,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is spellbindingly wonderful, wafting from the glass with notes of cherry, raspberry, red plum, peony, lapsang tea and sweet spice.

Of all Leroy's premier crus, this wine is the hardest to describe, since it's defined above all by its grace and harmony.",2015 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 95
401,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots from Lalou Bize-Leroy is an extraordinary rendition of this great vineyard, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of sweet spices, dark fruit—plum, cherry—and rose petal that's both more exotic and less savory than this year's Vignerondes. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with grand cru depth and dimension, its authoritative chassis of fine-grained tannin only asserting itself on the firm, saline finish. In contrast to the giving Vignerondes, this Boudots is decidedly more brooding and structurally reserved, and it will need a decade in the cellar and benefit from longer.",2015 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 95
402,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes offers up a deep-pitched bouquet of wild berries, spice, orange peel and grilled meat. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and multidimensional, with a fine-grained chassis of tannin that's more assertive than the structuring elements of the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes or the Vosne Aux Brulées and which nods to the authority of Clos de la Roche in its profile. The finish is long, ripe and sapid.",2015 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 95
403,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy offers up a pretty nose of red cherry, raspberry, lapsang tea and rose hip, with none of the more feral aromas that sometimes seem to earn this climat its soubriquet. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and concentrated, built around a chalky chassis of tannin and a bright, vertical line of acidity. This will need some time in the cellar, but it should emerge as a beautifully elegant example of Corton.",2015 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
404,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy opens in the glass with a bright bouquet of apple, lemon oil, wheat toast and smoke, framed by light reduction. On the palate, the wine is incredibly concentrated and intense, with a formidable structure and chalky extract that would be more familiar in a red wine and has a long, intense, almost searing finish. This was cropped at a mere 15 hectoliters per hectare, but while Chardonnay at yields like this can become overbearing, this Corton-Charlemagne—even in this sunny vintage—avoids any excess of weight or any trace of corpulence. It's built for the long haul.",2015 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
405,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons bursts from the glass with a deep bouquet of plums, red berries, grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is broad and velvety, its tannins entirely hidden in a sapid core of fruit, its underpinning acids bright and vibrant and its finish long. This Savigny's structural finesse is as striking as its marriage of bright fruit with kaleidoscopic savory nuance.",2015 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 95
406,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu from Domaine Leroy is one of the more brooding, reserved wines in the portfolio this year, opening in the glass with notes of plums, inky dark berries and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and powerful, with immense concentration and a velvety but firm chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the chalky, authoritative finish. This will take time to realize all its potential, but at maturity this score is likely to look conservative.",2015 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 95
407,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes from Domaine Leroy is a wonderful wine, offering up an expressive bouquet of cassis, game bird, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is more structurally giving than the Boudots from further north along the slope, with silky tannins, a deep core of concentrated fruit and an incredibly long, saline finish. This was cropped at a mere 13.95 hectoliters per hectare, but—as with all the Domaine Leroy wines—that translates into intensity but never heaviness.",2015 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 95
408,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2015 Pommard Les Vignots is fabulous, soaring from the glass with a complex bouquet of peony, sweet plum, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a deep core of crunchy fruit, racy acids and a wonderful sense of completeness. In Leroy's hands, this cool lieu-dit high on the slope above the village of Pommard has really excelled in this vintage.",2015 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 95
409,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"The 2008 Nuits-Saint-Georges Villages from Domaine Leroy is beginning to drink very well, bursting from the glass with a complex bouquet of cinnamon, blood orange, peony, cassis, blackberry and raw cocoa. On the palate, the wine is sappy, expansive and medium-full, with an ample mid-palate, fine-grained tannins and a penetrating, saline finish—weightless but intense. In this vintage Bize-Leroy opted to combine the Nuits lieux-dits that she usually bottles separately: Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières.",2008 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 95
410,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 1999 Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Allots from Leroy was still very powerful on the nose with ""thickset"" red berry fruit, a hint of blue fruit and a struck match scent that did not quite fit in. The palate is again powerful and dense, in my opinion my reflective of the 1999 growing season rather than the terroir, a village cru straining to flex its muscles and be treated as a premier cru. You admire that ambition, and yet it never quite achieves the nuance and complexity on the finish that would convince you of that. It is undeniably a delicious Aux Allots but one that did not trigger an intellectual or emotional response. Tasted January 2017.",1999 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP 95
411,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1988 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy was, of course, the debut vintage released under Lalou Bize-Leroy's name. Now at 28 years of age, it is probably beginning its descent from its peak in the 1990s although it continues to give drinking pleasure. Deep in color for the vintage, it offers pleasant cranberry, undergrowth, crushed violet petal and clove aromas that feel a little ""dimmed"" by the passing years. The palate is a little chunky compared to more recent vintages that I have tasted, quite tart in the mouth and conveying an almost Bordeaux-like structure on the finish that now feels a little short. Any bottles should be consumed in the near future because it is in gentle decline, albeit from a high peak. Tasted September 2016.",1988 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
412,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"It has been almost 15 years since I last tasted the 1989 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts. This was an impressive showing for a 27-year-old wine that comes from one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's earliest vintages of her domaine. It has a beautiful pixelated bouquet with strawberry preserve, sous-bois, morels and autumn leaves. This is sleek and sensual. The palate is medium-bodied with pitch-perfect acidity, still surprisingly youthful, long and quite plush in the mouth with plenty of vigour on the refined finish. It appears to be maturing at a glacial pace. This is a supremely well-crafted wine from what was a hit and miss Burgundy vintage. Tasted February 2016.",1989 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
413,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2002 Richebourg Grand Cru must surely be Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest wine of the vintage. It has more class than the 2002 Latricières-Chambertin--pure wild strawberry and black truffle on the nose that gathers momentum with each ticking hand of the clock as if to say: ""You want more?"" Of course you do. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin. There is great depth here as one expects from a Richebourg, not a powerful grand cru because this vintage was all about the nuance and delicacy, but it fans out wondrously on the finish with crushed strawberry and hints of cured meats. Very long, very elegant, very Leroy. This is an absolute treat. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
414,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2002 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts displayed a tensile, energetic bouquet that appeared to possess more focus than a 1989 Beaux Monts from Lalou that I had tasted a few days earlier. The aromatics are heavenly--mulberry, maraschino cherry, tobacco and a hint of seaweed, all beautifully defined and still surprisingly youthful. The palate is sensual, refined and backward. There is real vibrancy to this Beaux Monts, notes of raspberry coulis, red cherries and a touch of cola. It gently fans out on the finish, caressing in texture, refined and pure. I wonder whether this will actually improve with further bottle age? I suspect it has reached its plateau, but will continue giving drinking pleasure for many years.",2002 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
415,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2002 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is a very fine contribution to the vintage courtesy of Lalou Bize-Leroy. It has a tensile bouquet with edgy black cherry, dark chocolate and undergrowth notes, holding something back at first but then getting into its stride with a few minutes in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly brittle tannin (something that I occasionally find in this grand cru.) Yes, it is a touch foursquare, ""correct"" compared the more sensual 2002 Vosne Beaux Monts, but the energy and focus win you over. Drink now, but don't be afraid to cellar this for another 15 to 20 years. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
416,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2002 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes has a lucid color. The nose sprints from the blocks with lively bing cherry, mulberry and black truffle scents, perhaps a little more loose-knit than I expected yet still exuding charm. The palate is very well balanced, quite evolved compared to Lalou Bize-Leroy's other 2002s with a gravel-tinged, slightly ferrous nose . While it does not possess the complexity of its peers, this is simply a delicious, warm-hearted Chambolle-Musigny to drink now and over the next 5-10 years. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 95
417,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1997 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Leroy is a decent white Burgundy, but its intrinsic quality did not size up to its reputation on this occasion. The nose is slightly reduced, but felt a little straightforward with citrus lemon and flinty aromas. It was just missing a little ""fatness"" you seek from this grand cru. The palate is balanced with a keen line of acidity, though it never soars, remaining a little broody and sultry. It opens with time in the glass, but I noticed a touch of warmth on the back of the throat and so I would drink this in the near future. Tasted January 2016.",1997 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
418,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru is more backward than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment (the opposite to Hudelot-Noëllat the previous day when it was the other way round). Here, there is a very subtle marine/seaweed influence that tinctures that dark berry fruit. The palate is defined by its very fine tannin, the focus and tension interwoven through every atom of this Richebourg; the finish is surfeit with nervosité and tension so that is slips down the throat (guilty!) with so much ease. Wonderful -- one of the wines of the vintage.",2014 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
419,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée St Vivant Grand Cru has a pure bouquet as you would expect, an equal mixture of red and black fruit, but infused with cold stone, wet limestone scents. This is beautifully focused. The palate is very well balanced with superb density, almost Richebourg-like in style, here veering towards dark red fruit -- cranberry, wild strawberry and a touch of brown spice towards the supremely focused and long finish. Sophisticated and precise, this is a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will rivet you to your seat.",2014 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
420,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Unlike last year, there are three barrels of the 2014 Musigny Grand Cru this year instead of two, not that it is going to make it any easier to find and somehow, I'm not expecting a massive reduction in price. It has a very complex bouquet with dark red fruit, limestone, a hint of hickory and wild hedgerow, quite mercurial in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, silkier than the Clos de Vougeot, harmonious with a killer thread of spice that bursts out towards the finish. Very complex and sophisticated, this Musigny deserves several years in bottle before even thinking about it.",2014 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 95
421,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has just a faint reduction on the nose, but behind that lies very intense dark cherry, cranberry jus and mineral scents that seem to gain intensity with every swirl of the glass. The palate is stunning: filigree tannin, almost overwhelming intensity with great power and detail on the silky-smooth finish. This could turn out to be one of the domaine's finest 2014s given this showing, certainly one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest premier crus.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
422,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a focused, slightly more introspective bouquet at the moment: dark red fruit, a little briary and cold stone scents. The palate is where it is all happening...filigree tannin, tensile and full of nervosité, unapologetically linear and focused, a Gevrey that demands to be taken seriously with an intense, slightly saline, wonderfully detailed finish that lingers long in the mouth. Superb.",2014 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 95
423,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Grand Cru has a backward nose, much more so than the Latricières at the moment, though one can tell that is very well defined and full of tension. The palate is structured right from the entry, arching tannins here, beautifully focused with perfect acidity, gently flowing towards a very poised and tender finish that has so much tension. This is a regal Chambertin.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
424,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Boudots 1er Cru has an open, complex nose, here a melange of red and black fruit infused with cold stone, almost flinty scents that impart great focus into this premier cru. The palate is extremely focused, symmetrical, with superb salinity and tension on the finish that lingers for a long time in the mouth. Deep and serious, this is a quite enthralling Nuits-Saint-Georges.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP (93-95)
425,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was showing a little more reduction than the other Grand Crus this year, the shopfront closed. The palate is more expressive with supple tannin, a touch of white pepper on the entry, very cohesive but linear for a Clos de la Roche that keeps a tight control on the finish. But the aftertaste is extraordinarily long, leaving the mouth tingling a minute after the wine has departed. One comes away with the impression that this is keeping something up its sleeve after bottling.",2014 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
426,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes was showing just a little reduction, but behind lies voluminous mulberry and blackcurrant fruit, here edging more towards the dark side of the fruit spectrum. The palate is quite dense, full in the mouth with a gentle grip, some salinity towards the finish, although it is yet to discover is ""flow"" on the finish that at the moment just feels a little static. That will develop once it is in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP (93-95)
427,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny les Fremières 1er Cru has a conservative nose, one that does not want to come out to play at first, although it gradually unfurls in the glass. The palate is very smooth and silky, almost like a Vosne-Romanée, furnished with fine tannin and a keen acidic thread interwoven through what feels like a dense finish. It is linear at the moment, but it will fan out once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP (93-95)
428,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Renardes Grand Cru already has an intriguing bouquet that is forming in barrel, a little more open at the moment with dark berry fruit, a touch of Earl Grey and bay leaf. It is nicely defined, somehow effortless. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, nice and saline in the mouth, very harmonious and silky smooth, so much so that you might think this was Côtes de Nuits. Lovely.",2014 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
429,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Latricières Chambertin Grand Cru was more open and transparent than the other grand crus this year, with black fruit more than red, a touch of earthiness and a hint of wild mushroom. The palate is quite saline on the entry, typically rather foursquare and correct, the acidity extremely well judged with a controlled -- you could almost say -- conservative finish.",2014 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
430,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Aux Allots has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath lie some fine, clean and pure black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. There is plenty of energy and animation here, an almost sorbet-like freshness, slightly candied towards the bright and lucid finish. Among Lalou Bize-Leroy's village cru, this might actually be my pick.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP (93-95)
431,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is packed full of dark red berry fruit on the nose, just a hint of bay leaf and Earl Grey tea in the background. It is very precise. The palate is fresh and crisp, founded upon edgy tannin, very tensile and brooding especially on the finish that clams up a little, finished in tight-lipped and taciturn fashion.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP (93-95)
432,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Aux Genaivrières was a wine that was showing some reduction on the nose, but some rigorous exchange from glass to glass reveals some gorgeous, ebullient raspberry coulis and blueberry scents. The palate is structured and ""solid"" in the mouth, quite dense for a village cru, with plenty of substance on the mulberry and strawberry finish. Give it longer than necessary once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP (93-95)
433,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Vignerondes 1er Cru was a little reduced on the nose, but the palate is very promising with bright red cherry and strawberry fruit, as well as a keen line of acidity. This is a more feminine 2014 with a finessed, beautifully poised finish. Maybe earlier drinking than its peers, yet there is palpable energy here that should see it age for 10 or more years.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP (93-95)
434,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru had the unenviable task of following the spellbinding Richebourg and I feel that it does not quite deliver the same degree of complexity and profundity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, just a touch of meatiness on the more savory finish that is long and tender. Fine, if not quite at the level of Lalou's other grand crus this year.",2014 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot,RP (93-95)
435,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu has a perfumed and quite floral bouquet with pressed rose petal infusing the red berry fruit. It is tight at the moment and will need several years once in bottle. The palate is well balanced, some hardness on the mid-palate, masculine and rigid at the moment, and yet to develop the roundness of this vineyard. But clearly very focused and perhaps a Volnay for the long term.",2014 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (93-95)
436,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"When broaching the 2014 Savigny lès Beaune les Narbantons, Lalou quipped that it was her ""Petit Corton."" It has a complex nose of red berry fruit, dried orange peel and even a distant scent of fresh fig. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, plenty of freshness and vitality here, a little hardness toward the finish and a light spicy aftertaste. Very fine.",2014 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP (93-95)
437,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Lavieres has bright raspberry and cranberry fruit on the nose, more stoniness coming through compared to the Aux Allots. The palate is very refined, supple in the mouth, fleshing out nicely towards the finish with hints of brown spice and tart red cherries lining the appealing finish. Just lovely.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,RP (93-95)
438,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Au Bas de Combe, of which there are just two barrels this year, had a  reduced nose when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is lined with darker red fruit than the Lavières, nicely structured, perhaps more masculine, more rustic in style but with plenty of substance. Give it 2-3 years at least after bottling.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,RP (93-95)
439,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2014 Pommard les Vignots has a very elegant bouquet, very pure and self-contained with bright red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and acidity, red cherry and a touch of spice on the structured, slightly brittle finish. Very fine.",2014 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP (93-95)
440,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Romanée-Saint-Vivant 1996 from Domaine Leroy was actually a last minute substitute donated by a generous guest following a string of corked wines. It is an absolutely stunning wine that transfixed everyone before we knew its identity (and here, I must confess that I suggested it was Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.) It's actually better than that. It has a heavenly bouquet  of black cherries, cold limestone and wilted flower petals that you could just sit back and inhale all day. The palate is exquisitely balanced with filigree tannin, extremely pure and refined with astonishing tension and precision from start to finish. It's the vinous equivalent of watching ""Swan Lake.""",1996 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
441,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a more floral bouquet compared to the Romanee Saint Vivant, at least at the moment. It is very complex: black fruit rather than red, with hints of wilted violet petals and damp moss aromas developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with enormous structure and dimension. It is extremely complex, to the point where I found it difficult to find the right words! It just has a sense of authority and an incredible length that gently grips the mouth and stays there for two minutes after this ineffable wine has departed. Magnificent.",2013 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
442,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"It seems banal to state that the 2013 Musigny Grand Cru has a very “Musigny” like nose, but that is to say it articulates the terroir extremely well on the nose with black plum and boysenberry fruit, minerals, hints of truffle just in the background. The palate is very refined and pure, lithe, with filigree tannins and persuasive blackberry and bilberry fruit toward the finish inflected with hints of juniper and thyme. This is a Musigny that forces you to pause and reflect.",2013 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
443,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru has a more expressive bouquet vis-a-vis when I tasted the 2012 last year. Here, one finds touches of maraschino cherries, wild strawberry and undergrowth all beautifully defined, vivacious and ebullient. The palate is supremely focused and symmetrical, the tannin lacy and the texture so silky you might well mistake it for, say, a Romanee Saint Vivant. This is one of the finest Latricieres-Chambertins that I have tasted from Leroy.",2013 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
444,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant has enthralling transparency and clarity on the nose with perfumed black cherry, bilberry and cold stone scents, perhaps almost like Richebourg in style! The palate is medium-bodied with saturated, silky smooth tannins, luscious red cherry and pomegranate fruit with great purity on the long and tender finish. This is very tempting and sensual. Put a padlock and key on this for several years.",2013 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
445,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"After the outstanding Latricieres-Chambertin ’13, the 2013 Chambertin appeared sultrier and introspective, difficult to read at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, perhaps more backbone than the Latricieres but at the same time, its seriousness is quite arresting after the flamboyance of its “sister” Grand Cru. It is a Chambertin that does not quite want to get to know you at this absurdly premature juncture and it will require 8-10 years in bottle.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
446,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de la Roche has an airy and transparent nose that prioritizes the mineral-nature of the vineyard over the fruit at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, lithe in the mouth rather than fleshy, with very good weight, linear, but very harmonious and tender. This is a more understated Clos de la Roche in 2013, nevertheless a beautiful wine that I suspect might drink earlier than the other Grand Crus and yet will last just as long. ",2013 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
447,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has great clarity on the nose, here veering more toward red fruit than the les Brulées, with subtle wet limestone and granitic scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied, very “gourmand” in the mouth, the kind of wine you don’t know whether to drink or eat (not in terms of texture but the flavors). There is a lovely meaty note that surfaces on the long finish. Tres bon vin!",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP (93-95)
448,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a very complex bouquet with scents of wet limestone and sea spray infusing the red and black fruit. This is almost pixilated. The palate is quite masculine and linear at the moment, very well defined, impressive structure and presence with a very persistent finish that stays in the mouth a minute after the wine has departed. Divine.",2013 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP (93-95)
449,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Brulées has a very intense bouquet, a little more floral than I was anticipating, with wilted violets scents chaperoning the black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate is linear and poised, with tensile tannin: strict at first, but that latent concentration fans out gloriously on the tender finish that belies the structure. Sublime.",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP (93-95)
450,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Hail damage means that there is only a single barrel of the 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu possesses a very elegant wild strawberry and mineral-scented bouquet that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, strawberry pastille and subtle cassis notes towards the suave finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (93-95)
451,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Au Bas de Combe veers toward more red fruit than black, compared to the NSG Les Lavieres. The palate is very poised and surfeit with minerality. I detected a little more brightness and verve compared to the Les Lavieres with a prickle of white pepper toward the composed finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,RP (93-95)
452,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes seemed more closed, broodier on the nose, compared to the other 2013s from Lalou at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied, fleshy and tender in the mouth, the red fruit moving to black toward the finish furnished with white pepper, rosemary and spice. Quite a mercurial Chambolle, I would afford this at least five or six years in bottle.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP (93-95)
453,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"There is something slightly more ""confit"" on the nose of the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Les Lavieres compared to the Aux Allot. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine minerality and precision, structured and aloof on the end but extremely well focused. Give this 2 or 3 years after bottling.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,RP (93-95)
454,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Fremieres has a pastille-like purity on the nose adorned with perfumed strawberry and Morello scents, hints of rose petal just behind. The palate is medium-bodied, quite masculine and reserved at first, tertiary/forest floor notes towards the elegant, “classic” Chambolle finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP (93-95)
455,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges les Vignerondes has a rounded and even at this early stage, generous bouquet with dark plum and mulberry scents, wild hedgerow and a touch of mushroom. The palate is soft on the entry, plenty of ""rondeur"" here with a sensual, caressing dark plum and wild strawberry finish that lingers long in the mouth.

456,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée les Genevrieres has a broody, introspective, sea spray-tinged bouquet that opens beautifully in the glass, but there is something saturnine here, aromatics indifferent to getting to know you. The palate is medium-bodied with a ""confit"" entry, gently grippy tannin structure and an effortless mineral-rich finish, if not quite the length of a top vintage.",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP (93-95)
457,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is more subdued on the nose compared to Lalou's other '13s, at least on the morning that I tasted it from barrel. It just feels a little conservative. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly angular tannins yet plenty of freshness with a likeable red cherry and cassis-tinged finish that feels silky in the mouth, albeit without the persistence of a great vintage.",2013 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
458,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"There are just two barrels of the 2013 Savigny-les-Beaunes les Narbantons this year, instead of the usual six. It has a very expressive bouquet with light rose petal and forest-floor notes infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins: crisp acidity and an enthralling brightness toward the finish. This is the kind of Savigny you would slug back with abandon (if you had not seen the producer’s name.)",2013 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP (93-95)
459,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Aux Allots has a taut, reserved and quite tertiary bouquet that takes time to unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannins, a little savory in the mouth with a harmonious, spicy finish. This constitutes one of Lalou's more approachable earlier-drinking 2013s.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP (93-95)
460,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"There was just a little hail damage that affected the 2013 Pommard les Vignots this year. It has a light blackcurrant and briary-scented bouquet that needs a little more vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannins. It feels quite masculine in the mouth, perhaps more austere than the 2012 although the smudge of iodine is welcome.",2013 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP (93-95)
461,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"No, not the cheapest wine on the planet, but probably worth it. This 1998 Vosne Romanee les Beaux-Monts has a fabulous bouquet with wonderful delineation, hints of bay leaf and rose-petals infusing the mulberry and wild strawberry fruit, developing a fabulous ferrous note with aeration. The palate is fresh and wonderfully poised, the acidity perfectly judged, utterly harmonious with a cashmere texture from start to finish. There is a slight hickory note developing and enhancing the finish that is amazingly detailed, concluding what must be one of the most divine 1998 Côte de Nuits wines at the moment.",1998 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP (93-95)
462,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the otherworldly 2012 Musigny Grand Cru this year. Despite just a hint of reduction, the intensity on this grand cru is palpable and it unfurls in the moments it has in the glass, revealing dark plum and truffle scents that infuse the black and red fruit. The palate is defies all expectations: perfect acidity, utterly refined tannins, silky texture, a sense of harmony and completeness that it seems to stop the world. To put it candidly, this is a contender for one of the greatest wines that I have ever tasted from barrel…and I have tasted quite a few. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

463,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru was showing more reduction than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant at time of tasting and so I allowed longer for the wine just to try and shake off a little free sulfur. There is wonderful mineralite here – supreme delineation but it is tightly wound, more laconic than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant. The palate is symmetrical, refined and yet intense with life-affirming mineralite on the haunting finish. There is perhaps just a little more persistency than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant, a touch more masculinity also. Wonderful.

464,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru has an entrancing, extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve and wild strawberry intermingling with minerals, cold stone. The palate is so refined and effortless: filigree tannins, perfect acidity allied with a sense of effortlessness contrary to the effort that went into its creation. So silky and weightless on the cashmere finish, this is a wine that you will tell your children about if you are ever blessed to drink a bottle.

465,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"To be honest, the 2012 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has an unenviable job following the transcendental Musigny, but it is still a gorgeous wine, offering incense and blackcurrants infused with minerals on the nose. The palate is structured with a slightly chalky texture, adorned with a lovely sour lemon note that counterbalanced with broody black fruit that builds in the mouth to a very focused, linear finish. Sheer class.

466,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chambertin Grand Cru already boasts a sophisticated bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit, broody at first but opening with a few swirls of the glass. There are hints of maraschino cherry emerging, light touches of mulberry and pomegranate. The palate is medium-bodied with a sterner character than the Latricieres. This is an aristocratic Chambertin in the making, serious and obdurate, underpinned by firm tannins that support the intense, broody black fruit. It has wonderful persistency in the mouth, allied with freshness and race. As epic as Arcade Fire’s “Reflektor”!

It is adorned with a very intense bouquet with dark plum, wild strawberry and forest floor scents, the mineralite emerging with time. The palate has exquisite delineation – it seems to just glide across the mouth, with energetic sorbet-fresh red fruit laced with blood orange and spice, the finish offering hints of cumin and black pepper. This is very complex, intellectual Combottes for long-term aging.

It needed two or three minutes to shake off some sulfur. Underneath one can find intense phenolic aromas, pithy pear, nectarine and honeysuckle aromas that are just a little muffled at the moment. The palate is fresh and refined on the entry with apricot and white peach notes, hints of shaved ginger and a light, beautifully balanced finish that seems as fresh as a daisy. Lovely.

473,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru is more open on the nose compared to Lalou’s other grand crus with plenty of rich, generous blackberry and mulberry fruit with hints of wild mushroom just lurking underneath. The palate is lively and precise on the entry. The acidity is very keen here; lending nervosite and freshness, informing the tense citrus-fresh finish that is more like a Vosne-Romanee! This is entrancing and in my opinion it is better than the 2011. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons.

474,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is more open and generous on the nose at this moment, with lascivious redcurrant, dark plum and mulberry scents that are beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, succulent tannins offset by a silver thread of acidity. This contains wonderful focus and precision with enthralling nervosite and focus on the shimmering finish.

475,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2012 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a slightly ferrous bouquet with superb definition, hints of sous-bois underlying the black fruit. The palate is silky smooth and supple on the entry. There is fine weight in the mouth, fleshy and generous towards the finish that builds and builds, yet maintains fine delineation and focus. This is one of Lalou’s most charming 2012s.

476,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Again, there is but one solitary piece of the 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Vignerondes. It has a broody raspberry and wild strawberry-scented bouquet infused with touches of undergrowth and forest floor. The palate is where it is all happening at this prenatal stage: “killer” tannins, nigh on perfect acidity and a sense of purity that is already quite enthralling. It will need several years once in bottle, but this has enormous potential.

477,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Fremieres contains a mixture of red and black fruit on the nose, that mineralite surfacing with several swirls of the glass. The palate is very pure, almost viscous on the entry with a huge amount of concentration. Blueberry and raspberry jam on the entry segue into mulberry and even fresh prune. It displays divine concentration on the elegant, refined finish. Bon vin!

It has a fragrant, floral bouquet with broody dark fruit that take a while to open up.

The palate is very pure with filigree tannins on the entry. The acidity is interwoven right the way through this Savigny; lending energy and tension towards the finish that remains linear and perhaps aloof. This is a superb Savigny for long-term ageing.

483,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanee-St-Vivant Grand Cru is blessed with a quintessential, floral bouquet that has beguiling complexity. Just allowing it to open over two or three minutes reveals hidden facets: limestone cave, dried herbs, jasmine tea and bay leaf that are all exquisitely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine grip on the entry. There is plenty of concentration here, but it is brilliantly channeled and the finish fans out gloriously on the spice-tinged, animated finish. This is a sensational wine. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

484,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Chambertin Grand Cru demonstrates more complexity and nuance than the Latricieres. The minerality here is immediately evident and the oak seamlessly integrated. The palate is very well-defined with fine tannins, some unresolved oak here to be subsumed, but very focused and intense toward the finish. There is a sense of confidence and brio here that was missing in the Latricieres. What a fabulous wine.

Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

485,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Lavieres has a nose born of the sky more than the earth: airy, lifted and feminine. Touches of cold limestone emerge with time that are entrancing. The palate is vibrant and vital on the entry with a silver thread of acidity, a gradual build in the mouth with shimmering dark cherry and bergamot, then a gentle grip on the tense and teasing Vosne-like finish. Superb. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy).

486,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The rara avis that is the 2011 Musigny Grand Cru has a haunting bouquet that, once again, deserves time to unfurl with blackberry, pomegranate, mineral, cedar and oyster shell notes that are exquisitely defined. The palate is underpinned by filigree tannins. It feels so lithe in the mouth, spicy right from the start that sets the mouth tingling and then a crescendo toward the dark plum and bergamot-tinged finish. This is very complex and simply seamless in the mouth.

487,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Brulee has another striking bouquet, quintessential Vosne-like breeding and sophistication with very pure, mineral-rich red and black fruit marrying beautifully together. It gains intensity in just two or three minutes. The palate is vibrant and quite spicy, almost exotic in terms of richness on the entry, perhaps one of Lalou’s more extravagant 2011s with a scintillating, silky smooth finish that fans across the mouth with hints of raspberry and pomegranate. There is enormous length and intensity present here – a superb Pinot Noir brimming over with vivacity and charm. The parcel of vines within Les Beaux Monts is basically a continuation of Aux Brulees.

The palate is structured with firm tannins, foursquare at first but fanning out wonderfully on the second half. There is a gentle grip here with layers of pure black fruit laced with minerals and an extraordinarily long aftertaste.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins, a denser framework than the RSV with a powerful, almost burly finish, though perhaps the Romanee-Sain-Vivant has a little more finesse and tension. Still, a magnificent wine, though.

The 2011 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru has a bewitching floral bouquet, perhaps not quite as complex as the Clos de la Roche but beautifully defined, perhaps haunting being the most appropriate word. The palate leans more toward a red fruit profile with succulent ripe tannins; gentle grip and a multi-layered, white pepper-tinged finish that revivifies the senses, leaving it tingling long after the wine has departed.

The palate is medium-bodied with a heavenly satin-like entry. The acidity is perfectly pitched, this Nuits building in the mouth toward a complete, harmonious, almost Romanee-Saint-Vivant like finish that caresses the mouth and exudes wonderful mineralite.

It has an understated, refined, focused bouquet that builds with aeration: blackberry, a touch of bay leaf, minerals and a distant trace of Provencal herbs. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe tannins and a silky smooth texture; layers of black and red fruit suffused with minerals and just a touch of spice-box toward the long, intense finish.

So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

494,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"There is just one barrel of the 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Bas de Combe that has the most straight-laced bouquet of the three Nuits-St-Georges 2011s: a little rounded on the nose with hints of mulberry infusing the black fruit. The palate is the most structured, the tannins forming a fine chassis for the pure black cherry, dark plum and spicy fruit, a clever dash of white pepper sprinkled over the finish when nobody was looking. Superb.

495,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2011 Nuits St.Georges Les Allots has a striking bouquet, more immediate than the Pommard with lifted mineralite, beautifully defined and focused. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, waves of black currant and raspberry fruit underlined by superb tension and poise. Everything is reined in toward the finish that is very composed with a long aftertaste and spicy coda. Excllent.

496,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2011 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots-les-Milieu comes from a parcel that Lalou’s family had been buying since 1949. It has an extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve, wild strawberry, cold stone and cheeky touch of marmalade. The palate is structured on the entry: a little more masculine than her other crus with a tightly wound finish. A little more closed than say, Dominique Lafon’s 2011, encountered the previous day, and probably deserving two or three years in bottle.

497,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges 1er Cru Aux Vignerondes has a pretty bouquet that is initially taciturn, opening with blackberry, cola, a touch of broom and wilted rose petals. The palate is rounded and lithe in the mouth, the oak a little more pronounced at the moment although that will be subsumed with the passing of time. There is a gradual build toward a complete, caressing black cherry and black olive finish, a spicy note on the aftertaste so that you do not forget it in a hurry.

The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy, almost corpulent entry. It has very fine volume in the mouth, fanning out on the broad dark plum and mulberry infused finish. This is one of the most approachable of Lalou’s 2011s and can just be summed up in the word, delicious.

The palate is full in the mouth: a Chambolle with fine volume, just a touch of graininess with hints of cooked meat infused the red fruit profile that lends it a savory feel. There is lovely length here. The finish is understated, leaving just a touch of soy lingering at the back of the mouth.

It offers a broody bouquet with dark fruit: blackberry and Dorset plum, but it will offer more in the future.

The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

502,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee Les Genaivrieres, which lies in close proximity to Lalou’s maison in Vosne, shows a touch of reduction on the nose with primal red rather than black fruit. It comes across as a little conservative after the wonderful Nuits 2011s. The palate is silky smooth on the entry, very refined with supple, lithe tannins. There are plenty of pure dark cherry and raspberry preserve notes to enjoy with a sedate, comfy finish that has a lovely caressing texture. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee.

503,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"This is the third time that I have tasted the Corton-Charlemagne from Lalou-Bize Leroy. Here, the nose is a little more reticent than the last bottle in early 2012, but it opens immediately to reveal that rich, almost honeyed aroma, though here I notice a slight kerosene-like tincture. The palate is medium-bodied, powerful and very well-balanced with that core of spicy, honeyed fruit and a touch of glycerin on the weight finish. It is a sensual Corton-Charlemagne, but as I have commented before, it does not express the terroir with the clarity of others Leroy wines that I have tasted.

504,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the clear highlights of the vintage, the 2010 Musigny is simply magnificent. It possesses stunning depth and richness in all directions, with seemingly endless nuances that open up in the glass. A spherical, totally stratospheric wine, the Musigny is deeply resonant yet weightless. It is a standout in this flight of grand crus from Lalou Bize-Leroy. This is the purest essence of Musigny.

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable.

The 2010 boasts stunning depth and richness, with seemingly endless persistence on the huge, imposing finish. Once again, the comparison with Brulees is instructive.

Today the Brulees is much more open than it was a few months ago, but its potential is the same, which is to say, the wine is simply magnificent. In 2010, the Brulees is pure seduction. Rich, dense, yet light on its feet, the Brulees is marvelously complex, but in the end, it is the sheer texture of the wine that delights the intellectual and hedonistic senses most of all. The seductive, ethereal finish leaves a lasting impression. Tasted next to Beaux Monts, which this parcel is adjacent to, the Brulees is intensely floral and precise, with more of a dark red fruit profile.

519,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2010 Volnay Santenots du Milieu is one of the most overt, ripe wines in this lineup of 2010s from Leroy. Waves of sumptuous dark fruit saturate the palate in this decidedly ripe, flashy Burgundy. Today, the Santenots is a bit oaky, while the style is on the edge of being over the top, neither of which was evident from barrel. The 2010 will appeal most to readers who like big, dramatic Burgundies. It is the only 2010 here (and at D’Auvenay) that came in at the lower end of my barrel scores. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable.

520,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2010 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres captures the essence of Chambolle in its silky, sensual personality. Layers of radiant red fruit flow effortlessly to the articulate, harmonious finish. Soft tannins and refreshing elements of salinity make it impossible to resist a second taste. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.  

This is a knock out set of wines from Lalou Bize-Leroy. Cold weather during the flowering reduced her already minuscule yields even further. As in many domaines, the most dramatic proof of the low yields was in the skimpy number of barrels to be seen in the cellars. There are a number of totally transcendental wines in this lineup. As always the wines were made with 100% stems and aged in 100% new barrels. The 2010s are notable for so many reasons, most importantly of all, though, they provide a window to the essential qualities of many of Burgundy’s top sights as seen through the lens of one of the region’s most brilliant and inspired vigneronnes.

521,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2009 Chambertin is one of the wines of the vintage. It is also the least obvious of the 2009 grand crus. This isn’t an immediate wine, rather it is a Burgundy that challenges all of the senses with sublime understated personality. Time spent with the wine is immensely rewarding, as the Chambertin is constantly changing in the glass, challenging the taster to keep up with its sheer pedigree. This is all nuance and class. I also tasted the 2010 from barrel, and it was beyond profound. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.

540,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2009 Nuits St. Georges Aux Vignerondes comes across as quite shy and introspective. Dark plums, cherries and spices are some of the notes that take shape in the glass. this is a decidedly delicate style for Nuits and today it doesn’t appear the Vignerondes has quite the stuffing to handle the 100% new oak. It is still a beautiful wine, though, and most growers (or consumers!) would be thrilled to have a wine like this in their cellars. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.  

This was my first opportunity to taste the 2009s from Domaine Leroy in bottle. Lalou Bize-Leroy was among the first, if not the first, to bottle her 2009s, so she naturally wanted to give the wines some time to recover before showing them. The wines are stunning. Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top?

Crushed flowers, spices and sweet red berries sit on a core of silky tannins. This is an especially refined, textured Burgundy of immensely early appeal, even if it lacks the sheer excitement of the finest 2009s here.

543,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The classic scents of rose petal and licorice, allied to game, cassis, and dark cherry along with ethereal, penetrating distilled herbs and berries make for a heady aromatic display in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Chambertin, then exhibit themselves on a palate that combines richness and vivacity, textural allure with firm underlying structure, and above all density with uncanny levity. The incursion of salted red meat juices lends another layer of complexity while tugging relentlessly at your salivary glands, whereas fruit pit piquancy and chalky minerality in no way deflect the purity of this Chambertin’s inexorable fountain of fruit. This is one of those instances were a wine is so arresting it takes control of you. I felt enervated and afterward exhausted. For the few lucky enough to acquire three bottles of this, perhaps one per decade would be the proper measure. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates.

544,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The remarkably maritime mingling of salt spray, alkali, kelp, iodine, and crustacean present in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Romanee-St.-Vivant could, I think, only have come from this amazing site. Bright red raspberry and pungent ginger and black pepper, add to the invigorating and enticingly savory salinity on a buoyant palate at once subtly creamy and bright. Ocean meets forest as brooding, decadent notes of underbrush and other woodsy organic remains emerge; while musky narcissus and bitter-sweet gentian add enchanting inner-mouth perfume. All the while, there is a keenly kinetic interaction of all these elements. The finishing sense of shrimp and lobster shell reduction allied to persistently bright, downright refreshing red fruits is as uncanny as it is irresistibly coercive of the next sip. And if this wine doesn’t leave you salivating helplessly, I suspect you have glandular medical issues. My Leroy vintage tasting had reached a point where I was caught between the anticipation of those inevitably great wines that lay ahead, and a desire to simply cancel the rest of my work day and spend it sipping and contemplating this Romanee-St.-Vivant. But I still had inter alia eight Leroy grand crus to go – which signals something interesting. Madame Bize-Leroy served this ahead of all her grand crus save the Corton, perhaps because this is ultimately more delicate. It’s also less dark in color than its siblings. This should offer profound and dazzling complexity for 25 or 30 years provided you can uphold your end of the deal.

545,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"If I was expecting density and formidable tanninity from Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Clos Vougeot – and I guess that, relatively speaking, I was – it surprised me with its remarkable sense of buoyancy and transparency. The extract and the tannic underpinnings are there, but felt in the background – or like the ground you walk on and whose support you don’t think about. Through a deep pool of grenadine, cherry and red meat juices are glimpsed heliotrope and narcissus perfume; rose hip, black tea and licorice; salt and crushed stone. An invigoratingly tart kick of berry skin and rhubarb adds to the kinetic intensity of an exhilarating finish. In 25 years I suspect this will still have sap and energy in reserve. It is a Clos Vougeot like no other I can recall.

546,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, jasmine, peat, charred red meat, and fresh dark berries scent and saturate the firm but expansive palate of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Latricieres Chambertin. Much of the same “blood of the stones” sense of mineral saturation emerges here as on the corresponding 2007, but this wine’s dark family of flavors is allied to almost blazing brightness of fresh fruit acidity in a manner that – along with its underlying firmness – calls to mind 2005. What’s more, for all of this wine’s full-court-press of flavor, dark depth, and bedrock-firm structure, it reveals an uncanny sense of sheer levity that presages future elegance. My palate just can’t shake loose its array of flavors. I’m guessing that 25 years from now this great wine and its 2005 counterpart will still seem like remarkable twins separated at birth. (Please don’t imagine them in a ring together, though, duking it out to determine a winner.)

547,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Hints of game and animal fur as well as musky perfume of peony and narcissus all contribute funk to the aromatic complexity of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Aux Brulees, whose sweet side is represented by ripe black fruits, garlanded in heliotrope and fading lily. A marine alliance of alkalinity and mouthwateringly salinity joins peat, chalk, black tea, and forest underbrush and detritus on a silken, strikingly buoyant palate that really takes one on a tour of the dark, decadent mansion of Vosne-Romanee. This finishes darkly, deeply, envelopingly – and yet, the vivacious impingement of fresh berries, piquancy of tea and fruit pit, and invigorating pungency of mineral salts offer quickening 2008 typicity as well as a striking sense of counterpoint. This fits the Burgundian saying about Pinot offering a glass of night before you go into your own long night, and I hope to meet this sinisterly profound Vosne once more before The Reaper calls me. This wine harbors 20-25 years of vigor. (About myself, I’m a little less sure.)

548,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2008 Musigny is firm in texture and initially relatively reticent in aroma. Roasted red meat richness and decadently game-like elements put me a bit in mind of what I had expected from the corresponding Vougeot, but a blooming profusion of musky floral perfume bespeaks Musigny. There is a subtle oiliness of texture coating the tannins here and a tiny-berry concentration of diverse red fruits is shadowed by their ethereal distilled counterparts as well as by Chartreuse-like high-toned herbal evocations. This Musigny’s sheer sappy concentration, formidable structure, and carnal depth preclude its being charming or seductive in the unforgettable manner of its 2007 predecessor. But that doesn’t mean the finish here isn’t spellbinding or that the wine won’t bewitch you. Here, I suspect, is another candidate for a quarter-century’s enthralling evolution.

549,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons is one in a long line of amazing demonstrations that this site can deliver profound complexity and pleasure, but I doubt that there has been – and certainly I haven’t tasted – a more impressive instance, or indeed any more impressive young Savigny. Site-typical carnal elements in the nose are especially clean rather than gamy, and allied to suggestions of red fruit distillates, ocean spray, and forest floor. An infectiously mouthwatering savor of tiny red fruits (lingonberry, red currant, fraise du bois); red filet-mignon juices; rich beef marrow; mineral salts; leather; and brown spices floods and invigorates the texturally seamless, incipiently satiny palate in a show of palpable density and gripping persistence that somehow also leaves room for tenderness. Tea like smokiness and tannin that suffuse this Savigny similarly do not preclude a vintage-typical sense of vivacity. A vibratory, kaleidoscopic finish caps this thrilling effort that ought to be worth following for a quarter century.

550,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Wood smoke, smoked meat, game, and alkaline mineral notes pungently scent the Leroy 2008 Richebourg, then mingle with bright red fruits on a plate that shows stronger tannins – albeit fine-grained ones – than any other wine in the present collection. The invigorating, saliva-inducing salinity here mounts along with the fruit intensity on a trumpet-like finish. It’s easy at this address to become inured to complexity, but I think it’s fair to say that this Richebourg does not quite reach the level in that department of the very finest Leroy 2008s. Perhaps that will come. What is amazing for now is above all this wine’s clarion intensity and sheer palate persistence. It should be given at least 8-10 years in cellar with the confidence that it will thereafter perform brilliantly for at least an equal interval.

551,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"After the amazing performance of its 2007 predecessor, I was especially keen to see what the Leroy 2008 Clos De La Roche held in store, especially given the energetic proclivities of its vintage. Cedar, quarry dust, and aromas of clean raw red meat ally themselves with intensely ripe cherry and black raspberry, which acquire a liqueur-like richness on a palate whose texture is as seamless as is the uncanny welding of distilled and confitured fruits, chalk and subtly oaky elements it manages to achieve. Here’s an instance, though, where 2007 beats 2008 at its own high-energy game. Still, this hauntingly-long 2008 is remarkable in its way, and doubtless poised to reveal further complexity to accompany its amazing richness over the next two decades.

This manages to be palpably extract-rich yet buoyant, tannic yet polished and inextinguishably juicy. The long, lip-licking finish here seems entirely open and brightly illuminated, in contrast with the darkness, mystery, or seduction of this collection’s Vosne Brulees or Chambolle Charmes.

Beneath the layer of satin one senses a fine-grained structure as formidable as are this wine’s sense of somehow tasteable chalky mother rock and the vino-electric power dammed up behind it. This is a model of rectitude and its finish of pure, unwavering penetration. It’s also more latent than actualized. To follow its evolution over the next 20 or more years would be thrilling.

Tart-edged, tiny red currant and black berry along with concentrated, saline smoked meat stock on the palate are the perfect foil for all of the wine’s spiciness, zest, as well as a dark piquancy of fruit pits and smokiness of black tea that take on increasing prominence en route to a staining and invigorating finish.

Neither the mysterious low tones and minerality nor the vivacity of the corresponding Brulees are present here, but there is an almost implosive, sap-like sense of tiny-berry concentration mingled with resin and meat stock reduction that you simply can’t get off of your palate.

559,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The Leroy 2008 Pommard Les Vignots displays a vivacity throughout that is quite vintage-typical but in my experience rare at this address. Smoked meat and rich marrow lend a strikingly carnal cast. Cherry pit and marine minerality lead to a dynamic finishing interchange of invigorating bitterness and salinity against a refined, transparent, and downright refreshing layering of red berry and meat. This ought to be worth following for at least the next dozen years.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards.

560,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Sweetly ripe cherry and raspberry in Leroy’s 2008 Volnay Santenots du Milieu, are overlain with sweet, smoky, machine oil-like pungency as well as decadently floral and faintly fecal notes that suggest brettanomyces, and will render this wine controversial. A bright burst of vintage-typical fresh red raspberry and cherry juiciness emerges at mid-palate, where an uncanny balance of incipient creaminess and brightness is also suggested, but there is a very slight tendency toward dryness in an otherwise pungently-persistent and sweetly-ripe finish. Having a chance to taste these wines but once, I shall only voice as a suspicion that this is one Leroy Pinot liable to stray from the straight and narrow.

561,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Musigny presents in many respects a more profound and concentrated variation on her superb Chambolle Charmes of the vintage. Its tear-jerking brightness of cherry and raspberry fruit and their distilled essences, decadent florality, and saliva-inducing maritime depth are extraordinary. The carnality here is akin to foie gras and the umami-rich crustacean aspect akin to sea urchin roe and lobster shell reduction. Hints of blond tobacco, peat, iris, fruit pit, and a hit of caramel add further, bittersweet nuance to an already multidimensional experience. Richly and tenderly-fruited and –textured, yet vivacious and penetrating, this should continue to perform astonishingly over the next two decades if not beyond. 

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

562,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, rose petal, and dark cherry in the site-typical nose of Leroy’s 2007 Chambertin lead to a sumptuous, silken, sweetly-fruited palate that for all of its richness displays lift and elegance, and for all of its sucrosity harbors irresistible saline and carnal savor, rendering a saliva-inducing, tongue-titillating finish. As with the corresponding Clos Vougeot, it’s almost hopeless to try to dissect this further with flailing descriptors. Suffice it to say that yes, it is regal and suggests that a benign monarch might make for the best form of red Burgundy, a hypothesis that I suspect will withstand two decades or more of testing.

563,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Kirsch, rose hip, and soy intensely scent the Leroy 2007 Clos De La Roche, which reveals brightness and finesse as well as a saline savor unusual for its appellation. To be sure, notes of leather and crushed stone as well as smoked and roasted meats contribute further and perhaps more site-typical complexity. But it’s the sheer finesse, buoyancy, and vibratory energy on display that most amaze, leaving your tongue and gums a quiver and your salivary glands pumping helplessly. There is also a faint hint of heat, but its effect is negligible given what’s going on around you when you swallow (or, in my case, spit). Look for 20 or more years of excitement.

Dark berries and dark, mossy, humus-rich forest floor; saline, crustacean-reduction, and oyster flesh mineral-animal savor; sweetly ripe raspberry, all follow from the nose across a sumptuously rich palate, and into a prodigious, saliva-inducing finish. A trace of warmth (rare in the present collection) doesn’t detract noticeably from what is an extraordinary performance. Follow it over the next 20 years.

565,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Clos Vougeot issues from three parcels at different elevations of the clos, and the belief (in which she is hardly alone) that such a range of parcels better expresses the essence of this cru is lent credibility in the glass. Ripe plum, cherry and their pits; roasted meats; salt and crushed stone are all prominent in a Pinot of formidable aromatic and gustatory intensity; abundant but refined tannin; and a reverberative finish that rings changes on your palate. The depth of rich meatiness; succulence of dark fruits; and formidable minerality are difficult to break down into further descriptive details, but taking a sip of this is like turning your palate and imagination over to auto-pilot, and if you cellar some, I suspect it will still be capable of holding you hostage and challenging the prowess of its 2005 counterpart two decades from now.

567,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2006 Latricieres Chambertin smells of peat, soy, game, and bloody meat juices, which figure on a palate of compressed intensity. Talk about “blood of the stones” – this seems to epitomize that phrase, although some of the iron-rich, corpuscular, animal variety is flowing through its veins as well. The presence of tart red berry concentrate seems almost incidental in the present context. A sort of sepulchral depth and stony fundament lend this severely palate-staining Pinot an aura of mystery. But it isn’t a charmer, and in its present state one imagines a vampire would find it more enticing than would a normal pinotphile. The sense of awed anticipation – of what this might become in 10-20 years – is its greatest attraction, in which respect, too, it is singular among 2007s.

568,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Its forward, succulent sweetness of red raspberry and purple plum fruit accompanied by blond tobacco and smoked meat set Leroy’s 2007 Richebourg apart from its Romanee-St.-Vivant sibling, whose utterly contrasting personality may convey more alluring mystery and complexity, but cannot compete with the sheer sappy concentration and particular energy and exuberance on display. There is a meaty savor, smoky tang, and brightness of berry fruit that truly stains the palate. I expect this is another Leroy wine that will defy its vintage by retaining stamina for two or more decades, and in the process will almost certainly reveal further facets.

The sense of marine mineral depth reminds me of this year’s Beaux Monts, but allied to a more intense and fresher fruit. Mace and ginger add to the enticements of which this wine already offers so many, and the finish leaves me invigorated and delightedly licking the salt from my lips.

This is one of those red Burgundies that prompts you to wonder how such flavors could come from grapes, but that at the same time seems uncannily at home mingling with saliva in human mouths. It also perfectly exemplifies the iron-first-in-velvet-glove metaphor with a chain mail-like sense of fine-grained resilience that in no way detracts from textural allure. Bize-Leroy compares this (like several in Savigny) under-rated site with Corton, and the analogy is especially apt in such an instance of grand cru aspirations fulfilled. I would anticipate at least the better part of two decades’ fascination.

573,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Leroy’s 2007 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremiers smells complexly: black tea, hawthorn, wild rose, cherry, blackberry, and sea breeze. Plush and creamy yet buoyant and fresh-fruited, it opens up on the palate a subtle expanse of velvety, mossy forest floor as well as deep stock-like meatiness, finishing with long, intertwined mineral, carnal, floral, ripe black fruit, and arboreal strands. It will merit attention for at least a dozen years.

574,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Haunting aromas of violet, morellos, kirsch and sea spray mark Leroy’s 2007 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes, leading to a palate impression of refreshment and striking transparency to saline, chalky, crustacean, kelp-like, and meat stock elements. This is as tenderly-fruited, finesseful, buoyant, and downright refreshing a Pinot as I can imagine issuing from Nuits-St.-Georges, even if it lacks the sort of profound richness that more often characterizes the best wines from this domaine. I suspect it will remain well worth re-visiting for a dozen or more years, but (on the counterfactual assumption that I could both locate and afford some of this) I would not want to miss out on experiencing its youthful charms as well.

Expansive and overtly ripely fruited, yet firm, and more restrained in the finish than its aromas and initial palate impression led me to expect, here is a Vosne whose deep layers can almost certainly be mined only over a period of 10-15 years. Still, I allow for the possibility that this was in part simply having an inexpressive day or month.

Tender in fruit and silken in texture, this holds an irresistible immediate appeal, yet in addition to its sense of carnality it exhibits chalk, salt, iodine, and peat in its long, savory, saliva-inducing finish.

Satiny in texture and richly-ripe, at the same time this maintains a keen edge and offers a lovely sense of sheer refreshment.

Less refined in texture or refreshing (despite a tart fruit skin edge) than most Pinots in the present collection, it finishes with decisive chalkiness and persistent ripe fruit, but it isn’t clear to me that its faintly gum-numbing sense of tannic firmness will translate into longevity. Here’s one Leroy 2007 I would approach the same way as so many others of its vintage, namely to cellar for at most a few years, watchfully and recognizing that the wine might of course make a fool of me.

Smoky, faintly bitter black tea is emphasized along with leather in a finish satisfyingly persistent if not refined or polished. This might well become more focused and shed its slight rusticity with time in bottle. In any case, I foresee no problem with following it over at least the next 5-7 years.

The opaque sense of richness here is at odds with the norm among Leroy 2007s and is literally reflected in the glass by the wine’s turbidity. For now, the finishing fruit has to work hard to overcome gum- and lip-numbing tannin of a sort that I do not think is merely being temporarily accentuated and that I am not convinced – Leroy’s obvious belief to the contrary notwithstanding – conduces to long-term cellaring. That said, I would, of course, be delighted if she and this wine – neither of which I challenge lightly – made me look foolish a dozen years hence.

583,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Initially a bit reduced, the Leroy 2006 Musigny responded to a shaking, blossoming into a wealth of floral perfumes, ripe fresh red fruits, citrus oils, and marine breeze. Strikingly vivacious and buoyant on the palate as well as silken in texture, this at the same time reveals a deeply meaty and stony undertone. The finish dynamically weaves its berry-intense, carnal, mineral, and floral strands into a long, colorful braid. And in the empty glass you realize that the spell of reduction is now completely broken and an eruption of floral perfume and of spirituous as well as fresh red fruit essences ensues. This is another great 2006 representative of its site in the making, as well as another demonstration of how beautifully suited the vintage is to expressing this site's virtues and vice-versa.

As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest. Despite their winsomeness, they have long life expectancies. Since, however, I have very little experience of their predecessors as they have matured, I have confined my prognostication to a few isolated and very general comments in the tasting notes that follow.

There is a shimmering interchange of fruit, flowers, and subtly saline mineral and carnal savor here that will keep you transfixed, your tongue trembling, and your salivary glands out of control.

586,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Haunting rose petal, anise, and ripe cherry in the nose of Bize-Leroy's 2006 Chambertin signal a classic of its appellation, and the texturally-caressing, mouth-coating impression that follows tells you that this will be singularly 2006 in its tenderness and youthful approachability. Like the corresponding Latricieres, you have to look hard to find this Chambertin's abundance of fine tannin, as the flavors seem almost to hover over the palate, and its long finish practically dissolves into sheer inner-mouth perfume. The suggestions of carnal and mineral nuance here are extremely subtle – though almost sure to grow with time – and it is the wine's remarkably ethereal yet intense presence of sweetness and perfume that render it already unforgettable.

Creamy, gently soothing, and generously broad and sweetly-fruited in a manner one doesn't anticipate from its site, this Pinot's mineral and animal dimensions only strongly reassert themselves in the long, strikingly buoyant finish, along with black tea, distilled essences of red berries, and peat.

588,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Given the many extraordinary examples of Corton in this vintage, I was inevitably full of anticipation in approaching the Leroy 2006 Corton Renardes, and it did not disappoint. Ripe purple plum and quarry dust scent the nose. On the palate, the rich fruit here seems to oscillate in counterpoint with mineral nuances for a vibratory expression of vinous energy and complexity, and while the texture is velvet-like there is both a sense of primary juiciness and of lift that make for elegance, refreshment, and youthful accessibility one wouldn't ordinarily encounter in great Corton. The underlying structure is present for long aging, to be sure, but is almost undetectably woven into the wine's fabric. As this opened to the air, animal notes added to the intriguing mineral dimensions, and finish really took flight.

589,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Smoky pungency mingles with dark berry concentrates and bitter-sweet floral essences on the nose of the Leroy 2006 Richebourg. This Pinot strides magisterially onto the palate, with obvious firmness and depth of tannic tread, but at the same time a plush wealth of sweet black fruits that overrides the tannins and makes for a surprisingly soothing impression. Crushed stone and roasted meats add authority to a long finish in which rather obvious tannins returned. Somehow, the character of the vintage seems to suit the Romanee-St.-Vivant better than it does this Richebourg. But it's early days, especially for a wine of such sweetness of fruit, muscularity, and sheer extract as this. Furthermore, it's hard for me to discount the possibility that the unexpected and slightly awkward reappearance of tannins in the finish here might be a function of temporary perturbation or Burgundian Pinot moodiness.

This is truly like liquid silk, yet refreshing at the same time; intensely fruited (seemingly supported by a couple of grams of residual sugar) yet with plenty of Chambolle-typical carnality and minerality.

Smoky, saline, and pungently herbal notes mingle with the carnal and berry-rich elements in a long finish of mouth-watering savor and invigoratingly pungent smokiness.

600,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The Leroy 2006 Vosne-Romanee Aux Genaivrieres smells darkly of blackberry, mossy forest floor, roasted meat, and decadent floral perfume. In terms of fruit freshness, though, this is bright, while also displaying a hint of tannic grit. Its lingering finish returns to the dark side, with intriguing intimations of future complexity, though only time, I think, will reveal how this wine's tannins are resolved. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s.

601,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Smoked meat and fresh dark cherry in the nose of Leroy's 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes lead to a broad, sweetly-fruited palate enhanced by savory carnality and salinity. Compared with most of the wines here today, this lacks a bit of finishing refinement and lift, and there is a faint gum numbness after the fruit has faded. That said, we are still in the realm of concentration, sumptuousness, and healthy ripeness – indeed, near over-ripeness – that cannot help but impress.

602,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"I had to draw a deep breath in anticipation of what would rise from my glass of Leroy 2005 Musigny, and in that moment Madame Leroy trenchantly observed that “it’s another world” down in there. Tea, ginger, tangerine rind, myriad sweet flowers, cherry distillate, truffles, and fraise des bois preserves are among the scents that pour forth. Bloody fresh meat and implacable chalk join the medley of fruit, floral and spice concentrates on a palate whose texture “polish,” “refinement,” or “velvet” are pitifully inadequate to describe. For all of its amazing richness, this displays more of a confident inner sweetness than a superficial sucrosity, and there is no lack of sheer energetic brightness of fruit and drive. Indeed, seatbelts would be advised before attempting to swallow this elixir, such is the phenomenal thrust of its finish.

603,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Chambertin (like her Musigny and Clos Vougeot, from three parcels) leads with a knockout punch of super-concentrated, liqueur-like black raspberry, cassis, and licorce, rose petal (no, make that the whole rose garden!), and deep, roasted meatiness. Monumentally dense, yet vibrant and energetic, this builds momentum on the palate as it adds black pepper, tactile cinnamon spice, and distilled fruit and herb concentration. I have seldom experienced such a literal (not to mention phenomenally long) finish: it simply wiped the floor with your humble critic. If I were ever to encounter this wine in the ring again, I pray that it won’t be for at least a decade (and that it spots me 98 points).

604,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Romanee-St.-Vivant is improbably dark and deep in color even by her standards, and darkness and depth characterize its personality as well. Clove, cumin, cocoa powder, lily, and black pepper complement a nose of distinctly liqueur-like black fruits. In the mouth, this is liquid velvet. Chocolate-covered black cherries, plum preserves, and truffles are laced with creme de cassis and soy, underlain by a decidedly stony, chalky minerality and a fine but firm web of tannin. By now one realizes that 2005 is an exceptional vintage for this site in and of itself, but one would never confuse the D.R.C. or Potel renditions with this flamboyant, extravagantly-rich version from Leroy.

605,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"A dizzying and seductive bouquet incorporating licorice, spice cake, cherry preserves, and humus announces the arrival of a 2005 Latricieres-Chambertin that takes the smooth, silken-creamy texture of so many of these Leroy 2005s to a new level. Interestingly, this is a bit less deep in color than the rest of today’s grand cru company, and is visibly unfiltered. Explosively intense yet clear as a bell in its finish of licorice and cherry, and with ferocious animal intensity and a veritable smelting of ore-like minerals (could these be Latriciere’s notorious iron asserting itself?), this marks the point at which true geeks will get out their stopwatches and start timing. It comes off as almost spare in the context of Leroy other 2005s, and it won’t be everyone’s cup of Pinot, but I would dearly love to revisit it in 8-10 years.

606,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The parcel that informs a 2005 Clos de la Roche touches Leroy’s Combottes. This wine smells of resin, tobacco, incense, roasted meats, wood smoke, wet stones, alongside stewed cherries and rhubarb. Roasted and stewy richness characterize the intimate meld of meat and fruit on the palate as well. For sheer density this is incredibly impressive, but it’s not at all lacking in the kinetic department, either. What is lacking is the perfume or pure clarity of fruit that the best of this collection display. Almost frighteningly gripping in the back (or on the way down, should you dare to swallow!) with an implosive display of meatiness and stony minerality, this will surely need years to reveal its full potential.

607,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Their 2005 Richebourg leads with black raspberry liqueur, crystalized ginger, coconut, and candied violets. In the mouth, a meaty element, enhanced spiciness and a tart yet stewy rhubarb note emerge. To state that the overall impression is fat, full and creamy seems unnecessarily repetitive. But there is much more obvious tannin and new wood (even though it is the same 100%) in evidence than with the wines that proceeded it, and perhaps partly in consequence the formidably long finish is dominated by roasted meats with a sort of dry-rubbed spiciness, the suggestions of fruit more spiritous than fleshy. Still, the sheer intensity displayed is itself remarkable. This would be an amazing wine to revisit, but probably not inside a decade.

608,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The Leroy 2005 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes smells enchantingly of bergamot, lily-of-the-valley, maraschino, framboise liqueur and crystallized ginger. Yet for all of this sweetness in the nose, the wine comes to the palate refreshingly free of superficial sucrosity. Cherry pit bitterness and bright, ripe fruit acids, plus scintillating inner-mouth florality contribute to an impression of great precision and “cut” (the last word I would have used in describing any of the preceding Leroy 2005s) and the taster is carried away on a wafting wealth of finishing fruit, flowers, spice, marrow and chalk essence-of-Chambolle. (The texture is silken and refined to a remarkable but, in the Leroy context, by now routine degree.)

609,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2005 Corton Renardes smells of red cherry, charred wood, vanilla, and lily, but comes onto the palate particularly juicy as well as satisfyingly rich and expansive. This is silky in texture but bright and insistent in its sense of primary fresh fruit. A superbly long finish unites cherry liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla, chalk dust, and a savory meatiness, and the empty glass is sweetly perfumed with sensational intensity. I have never tasted a youthful Corton remotely so forward, perfumed, silken, or superficially sweet.

610,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"Leroy’s 2005 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Boudots smells of black cherry, beet root and black chocolate. Polished and suave on the palate, with pure, sweet black cherry and raspberry fruit in both liqueur-like and fresh forms (as with so many of the wines in this collection), it also displays deep meat and mushroom stock and a singed, caramelized edge to the fruit. This epitomizes the concept “layered,” but on the other hand, it leaves no nooks or crannies for warts or quirky complexities to inhabit because it’s seamless.

Smoky, meaty aromas and a chalky density, smoky, salty meatiness along with black-fruited intensity on the palate are certainly in character for this appellation. This has girth and grip, a monumental structure and layering of meat, fruit, and mineral that lead one to anticipate formidable but glacial aging. There is not a lot of charm, no flattering high-toned perfume ... no, there is “just” a seamless meld of materials with massive yet superbly well-integrated tannic structure.

In the mouth, this exhibits real girth and grip, yet for all of the enveloping aspect of the fruit, there is plenty of bright freshness as well to carry into a finish with low-toned, up-welling of meat and minerals. This Nuits displays amazing richness, energy, and sheer intensity not to mention clarity of fruit.

Voluminous and luminous in the mouth, this exhibits a continuation of the Leroy alliance of liqueur-like and fresh fruit aspects, amazingly precocious and beguiling creaminess of texture, and deep meatiness, buried truffles, and soy-like savor. It may miss the mystery of a few of its predecessors, but like Leroy’s Santenots, this Beaux Monts is compellingly sweet, rich, seamless and pure. There is a sultry sense about it, but no real heat in the finish.

But while the liqueur-like expression of fruit persists throughout, a fresh, juicy invigorating fruit character comes to its aid to prevent the wine’s becoming cloying. This Pinot displays in spades the proclivity of some of the best 2005s to combine the maximum concentration and richness of fruit compatible with refreshing juiciness and elegance. The amazingly pure, luscious finish – tinged with vanilla and nutmeg notes from the barrel – goes on and on. I suppose there could (and may well with time) be more complexity here, but the purity of fruit, uncanny balance and sheer length are enough to wow me.

Lovely dark berries, black truffles, moss, subtle muskiness and animality mark its very ‘05 and very noir palate, like an expansive, magic forest of flavors. The wine finishes with remarkable refinement and delicacy of plum and cherry fruit and a continuation of myriad mysterious fungal, scrub and animal shadings. Flatteringly creamy, it, however, shows a more tender and less obviously rich, sweet personality than most of Leroy’s wines.

A distinctively wet stone cast inflects the black fruits on the very full, rounded palate, and this wine’s long, strong finish is dominated by yet more sweet black fruit, plus red licorice, with only a low-toned growl of wild animal. And indeed, at least today, the personality of this wine is itself dominated by its concentrated, seamless finish.

Rich and creamy in the mouth, it nevertheless registers a brightness of fruit and invigorating cast as it spreads its charm to all corners of the palate. Porcine, smoky meatiness is never far from the surface, though, nor is a wet stone, chalky mineral cast that segues into the wine’s fine underlying tannins. A finish of sweet black currant fruit accompanied by bitter-sweet herbal notes offers exemplary transparency to floral nuances and underlying minerals. As with the Genaivrieres, there is plenty of delicious mystery here over which to scratch one’s head.

With that usually goes plenty of structure, and the present example will disappoint no one in this regard, as there are abundant albeit fine tannins to chew on. Almost inevitably though, from stem to stern, this has the trademark Leroy sweetness and richness of in this case black cherry, and the plushness covering the tannins. It finishes with formidable cling of sweet fruit, tobacco, roasted meats, and wet stones.

Uncannily meaty in the mouth with persistent sweet fruit and doughy, velvety richness, this displays a lovely sweet juiciness of pure, clear fruit and flattering floral perfume and creaminess of texture in its finish.

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

660,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The excellent 2001 Volnay-Santenots stands as testimony to Bize-Leroy’s conscientious vineyard and cellar work. Given the hail storm that devastated Volnay’s premier crus in 2001, it is mind-boggling that a wine of this quality could be fashioned. Its blackberry aromas lead to a broad, medium-bodied character filled with plump dark fruits. It lacks the power, concentration, as well as punch of Leroy’s finest Santenots, and reveals some stemmy characteristics in the finish, yet this wine bastes the taster’s palate with impressive layers of blackberries. It should be consumed over the next 4 years.

""There is never any bleeding in my cellars,"" said Mme. Bize-Leroy just before I gouged myself with my corkscrew, proving her wrong. Of course, she was referring to the winemaking technique of increasing concentration by ""bleeding off"" the watery juice of a light pressing prior to fermentation, not the results of my battles with her recently bottled wines.

As wine lovers have come to expect with every new vintage from this domaine, the 1996 Leroys are extraordinary, benchmark setting wines. This is the only estate I visited whose 1996s were as concentrated as the 1995s, obviously due to the fact that Mme. Bize-Leroy kept her yields exceedingly low (below 25 hectoliters/hectare). These wines will reach their respective peaks sooner than their 1995 counterparts, however, due to their softer tannins and brighter, more forward fruit.

814,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  Her Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees is so sweet, seductive, opulent, unctuous, thick, and rich, yet never heavy or overbearing that it boggles the mind.  The taster truly senses the presence of something unreal.  One of the more forward of the Leroy 1993s, this wine can be drunk now or cellared for 20+ years.  When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

817,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  The Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts is less exotic and more classically structured than the Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees, with a more backward, tannic personality.  Splendidly concentrated, powerful, and pure, it is a compelling wine.
When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.

826,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The best value in Domaine Leroy's portfolio comes from the Cote de Beaune.  An exceptionally great wine produced by Bize-Leroy in 1992 is the Volnay Les Santenots.  Having tasted it several times from cask and twice from bottle, I can unequivocally state that the 1992 Volnay Les Santenots is a blockbuster, super-rich, authoritatively flavored yet wonderfully harmonious, elegant example of Volnay.  The color is a saturated dark ruby and the nose offers up super-intense, jammy scents of sweet black-cherry fruit intertwined with oak and floral notes.  It is a wine of extraordinary intensity, power, richness, and overall grace and harmony.  This is a winemaking tour de force!  Moreover, this must be the ""bargain"" wine of her portfolio.  It should drink well between 1998-2015.

I have said it so many times that it may seem redundant, but if you missed it in my 1990 tome, Burgundy, Lalou Bize-Leroy stands virtually alone at the top of Burgundy's quality hierarchy. Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.  Although not as phenomenally concentrated and extracted as her 1991s and 1990s, the 1992s are more closely aligned to her sumptuous 1989s.

Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.  Although not as phenomenally concentrated and extracted as her 1991s and 1990s, the 1992s are more closely aligned to her sumptuous 1989s.

828,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Possessing an extra measure of concentration, the superb 1992 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes is a classic example of a top notch wine from Chambolle-Musigny.  It combines rich, harmonious, ripe black and red fruits with a super elegance and finesse.  Supple, full-bodied, never heavy or tannic, this smooth-as-silk wine is so concentrated that some powerful tannin is nearly hidden by the wine's gorgeous richness.  It can be drunk now, but 2-3 years of cellaring is recommended.  It should keep for 20+ years.

The wine possesses great richness, full body, and layers of opulent fruit.  This terrific wine is one of Domaine Leroy's top successes.  It should drink well for 15-20 years.

830,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The exceptional 1992 Nuits St.-Georges Les Boudots is a terrific wine bursting with concentrated, jammy red and black fruits, and a succulent, lavishly rich, opulent character.  It is a decadent red Burgundy, with a sweet, toasty, vanillin nose complemented by generous quantities of jammy black-cherry and flower scents.  The wine displays great fruit, wonderful purity, a vibrant, full-bodied personality, and layers of rich fruit that fill the mouth.  It exhibits more tannin in the finish, and thus will be even better after 2-3 years of cellaring.  It is clearly a 20-year wine.

The 1992 Pommard Les Vignots would embarrass many of the sloppily made, over-cropped Pommards from supposedly top-notch domaines.  It is a big, rich, tannic, muscular wine with significant body and a backward personality.  Do not touch a bottle for 3-4 years; it is a 15-20-year wine.

834,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Lalou Bize-Leroy is assuming a stronger position in the village of Chambolle-Musigny and she has turned out a very fine 1992 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres.  The wine boasts an elegant, floral, vanillin, and cherry-scented nose, medium-bodied, concentrated flavors, a supple, velvety texture, and an easy-going, graceful, complex finish.  It should drink well for 12-15 years.  I did not have an opportunity to taste out of bottle Lalou's Musigny and Chambertin, but several cask tastings (she does not fine or filter) revealed that the 1992 Musigny looked to be the best wine in her entire portfolio.  It possessed that extra dimension of finesse as well as sensational concentration and a velvety-textured, sweet, ripe palate.  The 1992 Chambertin was also terrific, but perhaps less complex and impressive when compared to the Musigny.  If I get the chance to taste either or both of these wines from bottle on this side of the Atlantic, I will update readers with my opinions.

Once again, the remarkable Lalou Bize-Leroy and her gifted winemaker, Andre Porcheret, have made the wines of the vintage.  Of course, Ponsot's Chambertin, Clos St.-Denis, and Clos de la Roche offer worthy competition, but considering the numerous vineyards she possesses, and the remarkable success she has enjoyed with all of them, she gets the gold medal in 1991.  These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.

Picking a favorite is akin to splitting hairs, as they are all super-rich, densely colored, broadly built, expansive, full-bodied Pinot Noirs with superb complexity and richness.  The most opulent, hedonistic, and decadent of this trio of premier crus is the 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Boudots.  Its huge, exotic nose of smoke, ripe cassis fruit, herbs, minerals, and roasted nuts is a turn-on.  Low in acid, this blockbuster, massively concentrated, voluptuously-textured wine is a knock-out.

Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.

844,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 1991 Gevrey-Chambertin-Les Combottes is an outstanding premier cru.  This magnificent vineyard, sandwiched between such revered grand crus as Clos de la Roche and Latricieres-Chambertin, reaches heights in Leroy's cellars that do not exist elsewhere.  It offers a decadent nose of smoked duck, grilled meats, black fruits, spices, and truffle-like smells. Superb black-cherry fruit flavors are loaded with glycerin and extract.  This unctuously-textured, hedonistic wine is remarkably long, sweet, and velvety.  Tasting more like an unevolved barrel sample than a finished wine, it should be drunk between 1996-2012.

Picking a favorite is akin to splitting hairs, as they are all super-rich, densely colored, broadly built, expansive, full-bodied Pinot Noirs with superb complexity and richness.  The 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Vignerondes possesses a wonderful purity of character in its gorgeously ripe, expansive, perfumed nose of black-cherries and other black fruits such as plums.  Decadently rich, generous, and well-endowed, this medium to full-bodied wine reveals deep layers of flavor, soft tannins, low acidity, and a finish that lasts for more than 30 seconds.

The power, weight, and density are something to behold, but this is an infantile, backward wine that should be purchased only by consumers with cold cellars and plenty of patience.

The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 89
868,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"Domaine Leroy's greatest Nuits St.-Georges made in 1988 is the Nuits St.-Georges Les Boudots. The huge, roasted, plummy bouquet suggests sensational extract character and sur maturite. In the mouth, this wine has spectacular depth, richness, and layers of fruit. The acidity is sound, and the balance is virtually perfect. This rich, concentrated, lavishly endowed wine should drink beautifully over the next 15 or so years. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 89
869,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 1988 Pommard Les Vignots is a wine to search out. It is absolutely fabulous, and in style and character seems to resemble the 1985 more than any other vintage. It has a dazzling rich, highly-scented bouquet of black and red fruits, spicy new oak, and minerals. In the mouth, the wine has awesome concentration and an extremely full body with stunning levels of fruit extract, all handsomely packaged in a medium- to full-bodied format. This gorgeous wine should drink well for up to two decades.

870,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"This is a highly extracted, explosively scented, berry fruit flavored Clos Vougeot that is medium-bodied, supple, and lovely to drink. It is not profound by Lalou Bize-Leroy's standards, but it is an extremely concentrated, well-balanced bottle of wine that should evolve gracefully for 10-20 years. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 89
871,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Village,"I have never tasted a better Vosne-Romanee Villages than that made by the Domaine Leroy. Only 125 cases of this spectacular Vosne-Romanee were made from a vineyard planted in 1902. It is clearly indicative of what old vines and low yields can extract from a parcel that is not as well placed as the Premiers Crus or Grands Crus of Vosne-Romanee. Astonishingly deep, rich, and concentrated with gorgeous amounts of red and black fruits, this wine should drink well for another 10-15 years. Do not pass it up because it is only a Villages wine. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Village,RP 89
872,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy produces an elegant, ginger- and floral-scented Musigny that is quite aromatic, medium bodied, and all finesse and charm. I doubt that it will be that long lived, but it should certainly last 10-15 years. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 89
873,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"This wine is excellent, displaying fine ripeness, good tannins, sound acidity, and a concentrated, nicely textured feel on the palate. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 89
874,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"For pure, decadent, hedonistic levels of soft, silky, plum-like fruit, try the Nuits St.-Georges Les Vignes Rondes. This wine is already performing splendidly well, and given its precocious personality and charm, it should be consumed over the next 6-8 years. It is a delight to drink. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 88
875,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Savigny-Les-Beaune is a terribly underrated appellation. With a highly talented winemaker and low yields, the results are wines such as the Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons. It has strikingly deep, rich, berry fruit in evidence, medium to full body, a soft, voluptuous texture, and a super finish. It should drink beautifully for 10-12 years.

876,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"Les Lavieres is an elegant wine from Nuits St.-Georges. It has a deep ruby red color, a round, medium-bodied texture, and excellent ripe fruit. The overall impression is one of lightness and elegance in a more delicate style than Les Allots. The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,RP 88
877,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The Nuits St.-Georges Les Allots (one of four Premiers Crus that Bize-Leroy now makes wines from in Nuits St.-Georges) is ripe, with a smoky, deep, earthy fruitiness, medium body, and a soft, underlying texture. It is a very good rather than profound wine, ideal for drinking over the next 7-8 years.
