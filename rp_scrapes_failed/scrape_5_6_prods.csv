0,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"One of the great wines of the vintage, and one that can rival its 2022 counterpart, the 2023 La Conseillante wafts from the glass with a strikingly floral bouquet of violets, lilac, raspberries, exotic spices, candied orange, pipe tobacco and rose petals. Medium to full-bodied, supple and fleshy, its textural attack segues into a layered and enveloping core of pure, vibrant fruit framed by sweet tannins and concluding with a long, precise finish. It's a blend of 88% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc, some 30% of which is maturing in amphorae. Harvest began on September 7, lasting until October 2, block by block.",,RP (98-100)
1,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2021 La Conseillante unwinds in the glass with aromas of black raspberries and mulberries mingled with vine smoke, rose petals and spices, framed by a discreet touch of new oak. This is medium to full-bodied, suave and enveloping, with a velvety attack that segues into a layered, multidimensional palate that's framed by ultra-refined tannins and animated by ripe acids. Long and perfumed, this has turned out beautifully. It was bottled in June, seeing three rackings and a very light egg-white fining during élevage.",,RP (98-100)
2,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"The 2021 Duo de Conseillante is showing nicely, offering up aromas of raspberries and cherries, framed by a glossy sheen of new oak, followed by a medium-bodied, ample and enveloping palate that's suave, polished and charming. Give it a couple of years to integrate its élevage and then enjoy it without hesitation.",,RP (98-100)
3,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Served blind from magnum, I failed to identify the vintage of the 1945 La Conseillante by several decades, such was its youthful appearance. Offering up aromas of dark berries, truffles, vine smoke and iris, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a tightly wound core framed by chalky tannins and a finish that's long and savory.",,RP (98-100)
4,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2022 La Conseillante is a remarkable wine that has the potential to emerge as one of the wines of the vintage. A blend of 87% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc, it unfurls in the glass with deep aromas of black raspberries and mulberries mingled with notions of rose petals, violets, orange zest and mint. Medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, it's velvety and enveloping, with a textural attack that segues into a multidimensional mid-palate that's framed by sweet, powdery tannins, concluding with a long, saline finish. Checking in at a very healthy pH of 3.65 and 14% alcohol, it is a beautifully supple, suave wine that retains all this estate's signature elegance but in a slightly deeper-pitched and broader-shouldered format than the profound 2020. Congratulations to winemaker Marielle Cazaux, consulting enologist Thomas Duclos, the Nicolas family led by Jean-Valmy, and all the team at La Conseillante who have firmly established this estate at the very top of Pomerol's qualitative hierarchy in recent vintages.",,RP (98-100)
5,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"One of the wines of the vintage is the 2020 La Conseillante, a blend of 86% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Franc that wafts from the glass with inviting aromas of raspberries, red cherries and mulberries mingled with exotic spices, violets and rose petals. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and vibrant, it's a beautifully elegant, sensual wine with a deep core of fruit framed by powdery tannins, concluding with a long, extravagantly floral finish. This is a Pomerol of striking purity and sophistication. Congratulations to Marielle Cazaux and her team for surpassing even what they achieved in 2016 and 2019 with this brilliant 2020!",,RP (98-100)
6,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"One of the most sensual, viscerally appealing wines of the vintage is the 1982 La Conseillante, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping Pomerol that wafts from the glass with aromas of minty blackberries, raspberry liqueur, black truffle, sweet soils tones and spices. Supple and expansive, with melting tannins and a long, perfumed finish, it's one of my favorite 1982 Bordeaux today.",,RP (98-100)
7,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Drunk at home, the 1947 La Conseillante is a striking wine. Wafting from the glass with captivating aromas of sweet berries, pipe tobacco, red fruit preserves, vine smoke, black truffle and subtle hints of balsamic vinegar that show the vintage's signature, it's full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with a fleshy, textural attack and a layered, succulent mid-palate framed by melted tannins and mouthwatering acids. Concluding with a long, sapid finish, it's an irresistibly sensual Pomerol.",,RP (98-100)
8,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2019 La Conseillante is performing brilliantly and rivals the 2016 as Marielle Cazaux's finest vintage at this leading Pomerol estate to date. Wafting from the glass with striking aromas of raspberries, plums, violets, raw cocoa, sweet soil tones and licorice, framed by a deftly integrated touch of classy new oak, it's full-bodied, ample and enveloping, its broad attack segueing into a seamless, layered mid-palate that's vibrant and concentrated, framed by powdery tannins and lively acids, before concluding with a long, saline finish.",,RP (98-100)
9,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2018 La Conseillante is composed of 83% Merlot and 17% Cabernet Franc, with a 3.65 pH and 14% alcohol. Deep garnet-purple colored, it needs a lot of swirling and coaxing to lure out the youthfully shy, incredible perfume of black raspberries, boysenberries, ripe plums and cinnamon toast, leading to notions of lilacs, clove oil and forest floor, plus a waft of iron ore. The medium to full-bodied palate is a jaw-dropping exercise in finesse, slowly unfurling in the mouth to reveal layer upon layer of bright, crunchy red and black fruits, supported by a rock-solid frame of firm, fine-grained tannins and tons of freshness, finishing long and with an impressive mineral and exotic spice firework display. It's an incredible expression of Pomerol that cannot fail to inspire a resounding ""WOW"" from whoever is fortunate to drink it. Tempting to broach now (albeit with a lot of air), try to keep your hands off it for a good 5 years and then drink it over the next 30 years or more.",,RP (98-100)
10,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 Duo de Conseillante comes bounding out of the glass with open-knit notes of stewed black and red plums, blackberry preserves and mulberries, plus suggestions of pencil shavings, red roses, bouquet garni and dusty soil. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has lovely purity and freshness with a light chewiness to the tannins and a savory finish.",,RP (98-100)
11,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 La Conseillante sashays out of the glass with the most gorgeous notes of lilacs, Black Forest cake, kirsch and black raspberries plus nuances of cinnamon stick, dark chocolate and licorice. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a firm, finely grained texture with bags of perfumed black fruits and wonderful freshness, finishing very long and very fragrant.",,RP (98-100)
12,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Duo de Conseillante features enticing scents of baked black cherries, mulberries and wild blueberries with suggestions of violets and fallen leaves plus a waft of baking spices. Medium-bodied, the palate has wonderful elegance with soft tannins and understated fruit, finishing with a quiet intensity.",,RP (98-100)
13,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Deep garnet in color, the 2010 La Conseillante opens with notes of warm black plums, baked blackberries and blueberry preserves plus hints of dried rosemary, fragrant earth and cedar. Full-bodied, the palate is firm and chewy with a lively line cutting through the densely packed, savory layers, finishing a little warm and lifted.",,RP (98-100)
14,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The medium to deep garnet colored 2009 La Conseillante strides confidently out of the glass with very classy Black Forest cake, blueberry compote and kirsch scents plus suggestions of violets, liquid licorice, cardamom and bay leaves with a touch of eucalyptus. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is elegantly fruited with a firm, grainy frame and oodles of freshness, finishing long and minerally.",,RP (98-100)
15,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2016 La Conseillante is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc aged in 70% new and 30% one-year-old French oak for 17 months. Deep garnet-purple colored, it slips provocatively out of the glass with a lifted perfume of roses, candied violets and lavender over a core of warm red and black plums, chocolate box, unsmoked cigars and baked cherries with wafts of wild thyme and tilled soil. Medium-bodied, the palate exudes polish and sophistication with bags of fragrance, freshness and energy, sporting exquisitely fine-grained tannins and finishing very long and minerally. Around 3,808 cases produced.",,RP (98-100)
16,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Composed of 81% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc and aged for 18 months in 70% new and 30% one-year-old French oak, the medium garnet-purple colored 2015 La Conseillante opens with reticent, earthy notes of dusty soil, garrigue, forest floor and iron ore with a core of warm plums, cassis, cigar boxes, star anise and dark chocolate plus a hint of violets. Medium to full-bodied with decadent fruit and a gorgeous plushness to the texture, the palate features impeccable poise and compelling depth, finishing on a lingering mineral note.",,RP (98-100)
17,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"The 2015 Duo de Conseillante is garnet-purple in color with a nose of warm cherries, black raspberries and baking spices with hints of dried lavender and tobacco plus a waft of dusty soil. Medium to full-bodied, rich and spicy with a plush frame and lovely line of freshness, it finishes long.",,RP (98-100)
18,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted at BI Wine & Spirits' 10-Years-On tasting, the 2007 La Conseillante has a very pretty bouquet with tarry black cherry fruit, black truffle and incense. I appreciate the focus and freshness on this Pomerol. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, a keen line of acidity, very focused with plenty of freshness and tension on the finish. Maybe the best bottle of this I have encountered, this La Conseillante is well worth hunting down. Tasted February 2017.",,RP (98-100)
19,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2014 La Conseillante has a well-defined bouquet with brambly red berry fruit, minerals, touches of seaweed and light incense aromas that develop fine intensity in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grained tannin. This Pomerol is very well poised with perfectly judged acidity. Whilst not a match for Titans like the 1989 or 2010, this La Conseillante possesses nuance and sophistication, a precision that does justice to the name. It should be earlier-drinking that other vintages that I have tasted, though given the terroir and track record, it would not surprise me if it gives 25 years of drinking pleasure. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",,RP (98-100)
20,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"The 2014 Duo de Conseillante has a light undergrowth-scented bouquet with light brambly red fruit, a light tobacco scent just in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannin, easygoing red fruit that just needs more complexity on what feels like a slightly monotone finish. Drink over the next two or three years.",,RP (98-100)
21,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted at the château, the 1986 La Conseillante has never really shone in previous encounters. Certainly there is conspicuous bricking on the rim, perhaps more so than other wines of the vintage. The nose is actually not too bad, loose-knit with iron filings, dried blood and leather, a little animally. The palate is medium-bodied and fully mature. There is good weight and body, but it is clearly at the end of its plateau with dried blood and ferrous notes on the soft finish. Drink any bottles sooner rather than later or head for superior vintages, such as the 1985 or 1989. Tasted July 2016.",,RP (98-100)
22,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2013 La Conseillante definitely has one of the better Pomerol aromatic profiles with light, clean and fresh black cherry and cranberry scents, a touch of potpourri developing behind. The palate is medium-bodied with bitter cherry and cranberry notes, the oak jutting out a little at present and drying the finish. Austere for the normally more succulent and fleshier La Conseillante, hopefully it will coalesce with 3 or 4 years in bottle.",,RP (98-100)
23,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted at the château, the 1996 La Conseillante has always been a good performer in what is a Left Bank vintage. Although there is noticeable bricking on the rim, there is plenty of freshness on the nose, quite floral with crushed strawberry, cranberry leaf and a touch of tomato vine, which after ten minutes turns into black truffle (typical trait in Pomerol). There is good vigor here for a 20-year-old Pomerol. The palate is medium-bodied and here you could argue that it is more advanced than the aromatics. Yes, there is good weight and balance, perhaps a little rustic compared to recent vintages, but there is plenty of enjoyable ferrous fruit, white pepper, sage, black truffle and spice notes liberally sprinkled over vestiges of red fruit. Clearly this is a La Conseillante that is à point and I would probably broach bottles over the next decade. Tasted July 2016.",,RP (98-100)
24,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted at the château, the 1976 La Conseillante is a wine that I have only tasted once before. Showing its 40 years of age with wide bricking on the rim, the nose is very light but with freshness, hints of gingerbread, clove and vestiges of red fruit. It is not as austere as the bottle shown at the vertical in 2011 and the warmth of that summer governs its softness and smoothness even after four decades. The fruit has departed a long time ago, rendering it a tactile rather than sensory wine, iron filings towards the finish deprived the substance of great vintages from this Pomerol estate. It is more interesting than a bottle that I would like to finish on my own. Tasted July 2016.",,RP (98-100)
25,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The only problem that the 1990 Château La Conseillante has faced is that it had to follow up the brilliant 1989. Here, tasted directly against the previous vintage, it seems more youthful in color than the 1989. The nose races out of the blocks, more precocious than I remember and yet never losing focus, offering kirsch, crushed violets and still that subtle marine influence. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly grainy tannin. It offers wonderful black truffle, morels and mulberry fruit, as powerful as the 1989, albeit not quite with the same precision on the finish. It is the purity of the La Conseillante that wins you over time and time again, and I would not hesitate in enjoying this Pomerol over the next decade. It will never quite match the 1989, but hey, don't hold that against this beauty. Tasted January 2016.",,RP (98-100)
26,Chateau La Conseillante,"Conseillante, La","Having tasted the 1989 Château La Conseillante on more than a dozen occasions, I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that it is one of my favourite Pomerols from the vintage. Although on its day, the 1989 Clinet can outplay La Conseillante, the fact of the matter is that the latter is the more consistent Pomerol. Here, it has that beguiling bouquet of melted black fruit, sage, undergrowth and hints of bacon fat, like a wagging finger inviting you inside. The palate is smooth and harmonious, a mixture of red and black fruit that seem to revel on the precocity of the growing season, even though it was now 27 years ago. It is a voluminous, mouth-filling Pomerol, but not extravagant, flamboyant for sure and yet never betraying its roots. It's just a wonderful La Conseillante, a thoroughbred Pomerol that puts a smile on your face. Tasted January 2016.",,RP (98-100)
27,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 1985 Château La Conseillante has long been one of my favorite vintages of this decade and this ex-château bottle, opened by co-proprietor Valmy Nicolas, did nothing to change that opinion. The nose is disarming with those gorgeous warm gravel scents infusing the melted red berry fruit. This is Pomerol through and through, fully mature yet still captivating. The palate is beautifully balanced with fine tannin, moderate depth, displaying that fleshiness and comeliness that the finest 1985 Pomerol wines possess. It is almost easy-drinking in nature, so much so that you almost miss its inherent complexity. At its peak now, if you own any bottles, enjoy them now, though larger formats will offer 10-15 years of pleasure. Tasted November 2015.",,RP (98-100)
28,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted at Bordeaux Index's annual 10-Year On tasting in London and then at the château. The 2006 Château La Conseillante had perhaps the most show-stopping bouquet out of all seventy-odd 2006s that I tasted at ten years. It explodes from the glass with raspberry coulis, kirsch, honey and marmalade, so much so that I am not sure if I would nail it as a Bordeaux, let alone a Pomerol! It is precocious and very attractive. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe red cherry and strawberry fruit, plenty of black truffle, fine tannin and well-judged acidity. This is an opulent, decadent La Conseillante that is atypical of the vintage and yet you totally fall for its charms. What it might lack in subtlety, it makes up for in sheer charm. Tasted January 2016.",,RP (98-100)
29,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Displaying spectacular aromatics of mulberry, blueberry and raspberry fruit, a dense ruby/purple color, and sweet floral notes, in the mouth the 2005 La Conseillante is not as broad and powerful as Petrus, Trotanoy, Hosanna or Lafleur, but it is gorgeously silky, elegant and stylish. This medium-bodied, savory wine is a graceful, provocative and compelling Pomerol to drink now and over the next 25 years.
",,RP (98-100)
30,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"An absolutely amazing wine from the Nicolas family, this is from another estate in Pomerol that is pushing the envelope to higher and higher quality. The final blend has moved to smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, now approximately 20%, with the balance 80% Merlot. Through crop-thinning, yields have been reduced to an average of 35 hectoliters per hectare. Inky bluish/purple color and stunning sweet tannins embrace a full-bodied opulent Pomerol with beautiful, floral-infused black raspberry, blueberry and cassis fruit. Full-bodied, yet elegant, this is a brilliant marriage between finesse and power. Stunningly pure, this wine can be drunk young or age magnificently for 20 or more years.
",,RP (98-100)
31,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"The spectacular quality of the 2012 Conseillante has also resulted in a good second wine. The dark ruby/purple 2012 Duo de Conseillante has loads of fruit, but less depth and ripeness than its bigger sibling. Nevertheless, it is well-made and best drunk over the next 7-8 years. 
",,RP (98-100)
32,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"This estate’s second wine, the 2013 Duo La Conseillante, is a light, pleasant, superficial, but fruity effort with no vegetal or astringent characteristics. It will offer uncritical quaffing for 5-6 years.  ",,RP (98-100)
33,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"La Conseillante’s 2003 is better than expected given the sandy, gravelly soils of this sector of Pomerol, which did not fare well in this vintage. Sweet raspberry fruit intermixed with licorice, incense and a touch of herbs are followed by a medium-bodied, fully mature, ripe wine to enjoy over the next 3-4 years. ",,RP (98-100)
34,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The quintessential elegant style of Pomerol, the 2011 La Conseillante offers copious aromas of raspberries, mulberries and spring flowers. Medium-bodied with pure fruit, seamlessly integrated tannin, acidity and wood, and a soft, velvety textured finish, this classic effort is ethereal in its elegance and precision. Drink it over the next 10-15 years. ",,RP (98-100)
35,Chateau La Conseillante,Duo de Conseillante,"The 2011 Duo de la Conseillante is a seductive, round, juicy second wine with plenty of raspberry and cherry fruit, light tannin and a pleasant, medium-bodied finish. Drink it over the next 5-6 years.  ",,RP (98-100)
36,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The beautiful 2008 exhibits a dark plum/ruby/purple color as well as jammy red and black fruit, crushed rock and floral notes. If this were a Burgundy, one might think of it as a grand cru Musigny. With excellent texture, medium to full body and stunning purity as well as nobility, this fascinating Pomerol should drink well for 15-20 years.",,RP (98-100)
37,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"La Conseillante made an excellent wine in 2001, another great one in 2005, and the estate hit home runs in both 2008 and, above all, in 2009. In fact, the latter vintage may well end up being the modern-day reference point for La Conseillante. Nevertheless, there’s a lot to be said for this 2000. An elegant, gentle style that is never a blockbuster, the 2000 La Conseillante has a deep ruby/plum/purple color and an unbelievably expressive nose of sweet kirsch liqueur intermixed with raspberries, incense, toast, and licorice. Full-bodied yet ethereal in the sense that it seems to combine power along with eloquence and delicacy, this is a beautifully pure wine that has just hit its plateau of full maturity, although ideally I think it would benefit strongly from another 4-5 years of bottle age and drink well for two to three decades. ",,RP (98-100)
38,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 2004 La Conseillante has put on weight since I tasted it from barrel. Made in an atypically structured, tight style, the deep ruby/blue-tinged 2004 offers up sweet mulberry, cassis, licorice, and roasted herb aromas as well as flavors. This medium-bodied, moderately tannic effort will benefit from 1-3 years of cellaring, and should keep for 12-15 years. It is somewhat reminiscent of the 1999. This is a very good wine, but the 2005 and 2006 blow it away – qualitatively speaking!",,RP (98-100)
39,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Austere, lean, light-bodied, and lacking concentration as well as depth, the 2002 is a pleasant, picnic-styled Pomerol to consume over the next 5-6 years.",,RP (98-100)
40,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Always a Burgundian, feminine style of wine, La Conseillante’s 2001 exhibits aromas of plum and raspberry fruit as well as noticeable new oak in a medium-bodied, dark ruby/plum-colored format with excellent ripeness, but hard tannin in the finish. Although disjointed, it reveals signs of precociousness as well as some edginess and unintegrated tannin (the reason for the question mark). There is a lot going on in this elegant 2001, but it is not nearly as profound as the 2000. Nevertheless, it is the type of wine that may fool early tasters as it does need 2-3 years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2016.",,RP (98-100)
41,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The dark ruby-colored 1999 is a beautifully complex, evolved, seductive style of La Conseillante.  The wine exhibits sweet black raspberry and cherry liqueur notes intermixed with cedar, toasty oak, licorice, new saddle leather, and dried herbs. It is medium-bodied with no hard edges, extremely pure, and almost sweet (from ripe fruit, not sugar). This is a lush, delicious La Conseillante that merits its reputation as ""a Burgundy from Bordeaux."" Anticipated maturity: now-2012.",,RP (98-100)
42,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"An evolved dark plum/garnet color is followed by captivating, sexy, raspberry, soy, Asian spice, kirsch liqueur, and toasty vanillin aromas. While not a blockbuster, this opulently-textured, medium-bodied effort is a model of elegance, harmony, finesse, and complexity. This wine's low acidity as well as wonderfully ripe fruit invite immediate consumption; it should last for 12-15 years.  ",,RP (98-100)
43,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Dark ruby-colored, with lavish, high quality toasty new oak intermixed with black raspberry fruit, this open-knit, medium-bodied, complex wine changes quickly in the glass, revealing smoky, mocha-infused notes. Although not massive, it is sexy, charming, and fruity -- in short, a typical La Conseillante. Consume it over the next 10-12 years.

This wine has put on considerable weight since it was tasted last year.",,RP (98-100)
44,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"It is tempting to give this wine an outstanding score because of its seductiveness. However, I do not think it possesses quite the level of extract and concentration to merit an exceptional rating. Nevertheless, it is an extremely pleasing style of claret. The deep ruby color is followed by an open-knit, black cherry, raspberry, and smoky, roasted herb-scented nose. There is round, lush, ripe fruit, medium body, exceptional elegance and purity, and a soft, velvety-textured finish. Think of it as liquid charm and silk. Anticipated maturity: 2000-2014.",,RP (98-100)
45,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"A success for the vintage, the 1984 La Conseillante has a fragrant bouquet of jammy raspberry fruit and spicy oak. On the palate, it is smooth, ripe, and medium bodied. Anticipated maturity: Now. Last tasted, 4/91.",,RP (98-100)
46,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"This wine has just begun its slide down the slippery slope. It was an outstanding La Conseillante that drank beautifully young. Once the baby fat began to fade in the mid-nineties, the wine was less enticing, although still an excellent, and perhaps outstanding if drunk from larger format bottles (i.e., magnum). The wine possesses a deep ruby color with some lightening at the edge. The toasty, cherry and raspberry-scented nose is followed by smoky, roasted herb, sweet cherry and raspberry flavors judiciously infused with spicy oak. The acidity is adequate, and the tannin and fat have faded away. Anticipated maturity: Now. Last tasted 11/97",,RP (98-100)
47,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Quite charming, fruity, and seductively easy to drink in 1976, the 1971 La Conseillante has now begun to fade, taking on more and more brown color and losing its fruit. It still offers a supple, round mouthful, but the prime of its life is but a fleeting memory. Anticipated maturity: Now-probably in serious decline.   Last tasted, 6/82.",,RP (98-100)
48,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Almost Medoc-like with a cedary, tobacco-scented bouquet, the 1966 La Conseillante has reached its apogee. However, it is unlikely to decline for several years because of the firmness and structure. Medium ruby with some amber color, this is a rather restrained La Conseillante, yet it is complex and interesting. Anticipated maturity: Now. Last tasted, 5/84.",,RP (98-100)
49,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"I had an excellent bottle of the 1964 La Conseillante in the late eighties that proved to be better than I indicated in my tasting notes in the first edition of this book. Medium ruby, with some amber at the edge, this wine has a sensational nose of smoky, almost buttery, nutty, superripe, plummy fruit and herbs. In the mouth, it is round, generous, even opulent, with a great deal of concentration, and a long, alcoholic finish. By the standards of the chateau, this is a larger-framed, more muscular wine than usual. Anticipated maturity: Now.   Last tasted, 11/89.",,RP (98-100)
50,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"One of Bordeaux's most compellingly seductive wines, La Conseillante's early charm can lead tasters to believe that the wine will not age. However, top vintages of La Conseillante can age for two decades, but they are often drunk immediately after bottling because of their expressive aromatics, velvety texture, and delicious fruit.  Dark ruby/garnet, with a backward, spicy, peppery, black fruit-scented nose (also truffles?), La Conseillante's tell-tale sweet, charming, alluring fruit is pushed to the background by the 1994's tannin and austerity. The wine reveals more weight than the 1993, but also more structure. There is good fruit under the tannin, but the 1994, atypically for La Conseillante, requires another 1-3 years of cellaring; it should keep for 10-12.",,RP 87
51,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"One of Bordeaux's most compellingly seductive wines, La Conseillante's early charm can lead tasters to believe that the wine will not age. However, top vintages of La Conseillante can age for two decades, but they are often drunk immediately after bottling because of their expressive aromatics, velvety texture, and delicious fruit.  A well-made wine for the vintage, La Conseillante's 1993 displays an attractive dark ruby color, a black-raspberry, sweet vanillin, alluring bouquet, pretty, low acid, fleshy, round flavors that caresse the palate, and finish with plenty of black fruit and glycerin. Already delicious and flattering, this moderately weighted wine should drink well for 7-8 years.",,RP 87
52,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"This was a stunning performance for this wine, which I had thought was ever so slightly beginning to decline. In this tasting, the 1970 La Conseillante exhibited the sweet, truffle, caramel, mocha, jammy black-cherry, and toasty nose of this renowned estate, as well as sweet, round, concentrated flavors, and a lush, velvety texture, with a heady, alcoholic, rich finish. This was my last bottle out of what was a glorious case of wine. While I may have drunk the other eleven too soon, every bottle was drained quickly after the cork was pulled. Owners are advised to drink it up. Those who may be fortunate enough to have larger format bottles have another 10+ years to enjoy this stunningly proportioned La Conseillante.",,RP 87
53,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Drinking extremely well (far better than I ever believed it would), the 1975 La Conseillante surprised me with its sweet, jammy, kirsch/black-cherry/flowery nose with vague scents of truffles.  Medium-bodied, sweet, and round, with hard tannin in the finish, this wine, which has often tasted disjointed and lacking depth, came through strongly in a January, 1996 tasting.  Fully mature, it is capable of lasting another 5-10 years.  The color reveals considerable rust and orange, suggesting more advanced maturity than the aromatics and flavors display.  Perhaps there is some bottle variation, but this was a stronger, more intense example of La Conseillante than I had previously tasted.",,RP 87
54,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"La Conseillante's 1961 appears to be dropping its fruit and drying out - ever so slightly.  It is more angular, with more amber/rust/orange in its color.  The tannin in the finish is also becoming aggressive, suggesting this wine has turned the corner and is in decline.  

The notes for this wine are taken from the description of Series III - Flight D of the 1995 tasting conducted in Munich by Helga and Hardy Rodenstock. Many years after the tasting from which this note derives allegations were made concerning the authenticity of old and rare bottles of wine sold by Hardy Rodenstock to collectors around the world.  The matter has been the subject of numerous articles, litigation and at least one book. Mr. Parker believes that the wines served to him at this tasting were authentic so this note and the others from that specific tasting continue to be posted on eRobertParker.com.",,RP 87
55,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 1992 La Conseillante displays light to medium body, an attractive but diluted raspberry and vanillin-scented nose, a supple texture, and a short, shallow, woody finish.  Given the wine's lack of concentration, it should be drunk over the next 3-4 years.   For one of the most elegant and stylish wines of Bordeaux (as well as a personal favorite), this is a disappointment.",,RP 87
56,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted Once

I must confess I never dreamed so many 1959 Pomerols would turn out so rich and concentrated.  La Conseillante's 1959 exhibits a fragrant bouquet of flowers, black-raspberries, and smoke, medium to full body, soft tannin, and wonderful, pure, sweet, expansive fruit.  It is a classic example of La Conseillante's ability to produce authoritatively rich wines of extraordinary elegance and complexity.

",,RP 87
57,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Tasted 6 Times With Consistent Notes

It has been several years since I had the 1949, but having gone through a half case I purchased in outstanding condition, I must say that every bottle was exceptional, with a gorgeously ripe, jammy nose of black fruits, sweet, expansive, medium-bodied flavors, and a silky texture.  It is interesting that La Conseillante, never the most tannic, muscular, or powerful wine, appears to be drinkable at a remarkably young age yet hold its fruit for decades.  A friend of the Nicolas family, the proprietor, told me he consumed several cases of the 1949 in the early fifties because it was so tasty - further proof that balance, not tannin, is often the key to a graceful evolution.  I have high hopes that the 1989 and 1990 will prove to be as awesome and ageworthy as the 1949.",,RP 87
58,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"La Conseillante's silky, soft, graceful style can be found in the light-bodied, delicate 1991.  The medium ruby color is followed by a perfumed nose of toasty, smoky, new oak and raspberry fruit.  Although the finish is short, there is some lovely fruit in the middle.  Drink it over the next 4-5 years.",,RP 87
59,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"The 1988 suffers in comparison to the 1989, but it is a light, charming, supple, medium-bodied wine for drinking over the next 5-7 years.  Tasty, yes, but where is the grip and depth?  Last tasted, 6/93. 
",,RP 87
60,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"Far superior to the 1988, the expansive, burgundian-styled, deliciously fruity, soft 1987 makes for a seductive, succulent drink.  No hard edges are present given the absence of tannin and the low acidity.  The ripe Merlot fruit is well-displayed in a medium-bodied format.  Drink this charmer over the next 3-4 years.  Last tasted, 8/93.
",,RP 87
61,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"This wine needs to be consumed as it is evolving at an advanced pace.  I have enjoyed it many times and it has been one of my favorite La Conseillantes for present consumption.  However, over the last year I have noticed that it is taking on more amber at the edge and is becoming more diffuse.  The color is a medium ruby/purple with noticeable orange at the edge.  The huge, smoky, herbal, licorice, and black-raspberry-scented nose is well-developed and alluring.  The flavors are soft and luscious in this medium-bodied, silky smooth wine.  However, having consumed it regularly, I sense a slight tough edge emerging, suggesting it may be just beginning to fade.  In magnums, this wine is probably even more stunningly perfumed and delicious, but if you have it in regular bottles, I would plan to drink it over the next 5 or so years.  Last tasted, 7/93.",,RP 87
62,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"This wine is in a serious decline.  The color is light ruby with orange tints, and the wine appears to have lost most of the fruit it once possessed.  A hollow, attenuated wine, it is clearly cracking up.  Last tasted, 7/93.",,RP 87
63,Chateau La Conseillante,La Conseillante,"I had not tasted this wine in some time and was concerned about its vitality.  Its washed-out ruby color with a brownish edge gave me even more reason to worry.  Although the 1978 La Conseillante still possesses some fruit, compared to the richer, more concentrated, more compelling La Conseillantes made since 1981, the 1978 is a lighter, meagerly endowed wine.  While there is some charm, this is a one-dimensional, diluted, compact wine that appears to be on the verge of fading.  Last tasted, 7/93.",,RP 87
64,Domaine des Lambrays,Cabernet Sauvignon Fortunate Son,"There are 600 cases of the 100% Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Fortunate Son. This wine only spends 24 months in cask, but shows terrific black and red currant fruit, licorice, forest floor and a touch of underbrush in a medium to full-bodied, supple, lush style that is probably the only Woodbridge wine best drunk in its first 15 or so years of life.",,RP 93
65,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinot Noir Cherry Pie Stanly Ranch,"Woodbridge’s Midas touch with Cabernet Sauvignon also extends to his Pinot Noirs. He makes three of them – two from the Sonoma Coast and one from the Southern Napa Valley site called Stanley Ranch that was often used by Berringer. The 2013s are all brilliantly packaged with a gorgeous picture of a cherry pie on the label. The 2013 Cherry Pie Pinot Noir Stanly Ranch is a hefty Pinot at 15+% natural alcohol, but exhibits delicious kirsch liqueur notes, roasted herbs, spice box and medium to full-bodied fleshy and succulent fruit and texture. It is a sexy, endearing style to drink over the next 5-7 years.",,RP 93
66,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinot Noir Rodgers Creek,"The 2013 Pinot Noir Rodgers Creek again offers up forest floor and more Northern Côte de Nuits-like notes of Asian plum sauce, mulberry and other fruits along the blacker fruit spectrum. It is a lovely, rich wine that should be drunk between 2016 and 2025.",,RP 93
67,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinto Noir Huckleberry Snodgrass,"A new cuvée, the 2013 Huckleberry Snodgrass Pinot Noir from Russian River looks stronger than the 2012 Carinalli, so perhaps Woodbridge has a new source of even better fruit. This wine shows terrific blueberry, black raspberry and floral notes, a medium to full-bodied mouthfeel, good acidity and excellent delineation and precision. Drink it over the next 4-5 years.",,RP 93
68,Domaine des Lambrays,Cabernet Sauvignon Fortunate Son,"As for the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines, there is the blend called Fortunate Son, and the 2012 edition is still in barrel. It displays opulence in its wonderfully sweet, pure blackberry and black currant fruit along with some earthiness, spice box, graphite and background oak. This is fleshy, rich, broad, and certainly capable of lasting another 10-15 years.",,RP 93
69,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinot Noir Rodgers Creek,"From the Sonoma Coast, the 2012 Pinot Noir Rodgers Creek (the Syrah from this parcel is certainly spectacular, as evidenced by my notes on David Ramey’s cuvées made from this fruit) is a much more Côte de Nuits-style of Pinot Noir, with notes of forest floor, autumnal, brooding, vegetative notes of loamy soil, but more black fruit than the Cherry Pie. It is another beauty, and more complex than the Cherry Pie, if that’s what you’re looking for. It should be drunk between now and 2018.",,RP 93
70,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinot Noir Cherry Pie Stanly Ranch,"The two vintages of Pinot Noir that I tasted started with his famous 2012 Cherry Pie Stanly Ranch. This is a completely destemmed, sexy, in-your-face style of Pinot Noir, much like Jayson Woodbridge himself. Terroiristes will probably get their panties in a twist arguing that it is too delicious, too yummy, but this is a beautiful wine with super black cherry/kirsch liqueur-like fruitiness, soft tannins, and a round, juicy, authentic Pinot Noir character. Drink it over the next 4-5 years.",,RP 93
71,Domaine des Lambrays,Pinot Noir Carinalli,"The third Pinot Noir I tasted is the 2012 Carinalli, which is the leanest, most earthy and spicy of the Pinot Noirs, with loads of underbrush as well as dusty, loamy soil scents, with the fruit pushed way to the background. Drink it over the next 5-6 years. In short, these are three completely different Pinot Noir styles.",,RP 93
72,Domaine des Lambrays,Cabernet Sauvignon Few and Far Between,"Another great success that escaped the insidious spread of botrytis on the valley floor is the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon Few and Far Between. One of the top wines of the vintage, the Cabernet Franc component gives the wine a multidimensional aromatic display of forest floor, blueberries, mulberries, black raspberries, plums, black currants and a wet rock-like minerality. The rich, full-bodied flavors seem almost an anomaly in this vintage given its extraordinary irregularity and frequent disappointments. This prodigious 2011 is a candidate for the wine of the vintage. 

Proprietor Jayson Woodbridge, one of the wine world’s most compelling, outspoken, irreverent, bigger-than-life personalities, can get away with just about anything he wants to say or do simply because year after year he proves what great wine is all about from his 15-acre Kayli Morgan Vineyard east of St. Helena, his 15-acre parcel on Howell Mountain, and another vineyard on the upslope of the Eisele Vineyard (recently acquired by Chateau Latour in Pauillac), called Few and Far Between. Woodbridge was recently profiled in a wonderful graphic wine magazine called “Loam Baby,” and may have set a Guiness Book World record for the number of times the word “F***” was used in that interview. I first met Woodbridge, who hales from Canada, when he released his first vintage, 2000, which is still going strong and showing more staying power than I would ever have imagined even though I loved the wine from the beginning. It remains a sensational wine at age 13. He currently has six cuvees of Cabernet Sauvignon, the Kayli Morgan Vineyard, the Arc Vineyard on Howell Mountain, the Few and Far Between Vineyard in Calistoga near the Eisele Vineyard, a wine called Deep Time which spends considerably more time in barrel than its siblings, a wine called Precious, and depending on his mood, another wine called Fortunate Son. He also makes a hedonistic, attractive Pinot Noir from the Stanly Vineyard called Cherry Pie, and he has had enormous success with the high quality yet bargain-basement priced selections from around the world called Layer Cake. The Few and Far Between Vineyard is a 5-acre parcel on what Woodbridge calls the “upside of the Eisele Vineyard.” The only blend in his portfolio, this cuvee includes 15% Cabernet Franc. The first vintage was 2008, and this is another exceptional wine, with the 2010 achieving perfection and the 2012 capable of doing so. I only tasted two vintages of the Precious cuvee made from Woodbridge’s favorite barrels. Normally he limits production to 100 or so cases, which would be four barrels. I only tasted one vintage of the Cabernet Sauvignon Deep Time because it spends up to 40 months in barrel and almost becomes like a great chef’s reduction sauce because of evaporation. It is normally a selection from the Kayli Morgan Vineyard. It is a remarkable wine, but very little is available.

73,Domaine des Lambrays,Cabernet Sauvignon Fortunate Son,"The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Fortunate Son, which is defined as selections from the cellar, is a beauty. Woodbridge considers this wine to be a completely separate project. It appears to be virtually all Cabernet Sauvignon in its aromatic and flavor profiles, offering a deep, full-bodied, intense, powerful style with the purity, richness and appeal that his other wines display. Of course, 2010 was a remarkable vintage in Napa, and this wine reflects that.

The 2010 is a gorgeous, exuberant Cherry Pie with great balance and overall harmony. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.

Seamless, rich and inviting, the 2009 is pure opulence and richness. Bittersweet chocolate, mocha, plums and spice box are some of the many notes that flow through to the rich, enveloping finish. A round, layered wine, the 2009 stands out for its depth and total plushness. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.  

Jayson Woodbridge is one of the most focused and determined people I have ever met in the Napa Valley, or anywhere, for that matter. A man of deeply held convictions, Woodbridge knows exactly what he wants to achieve and won’t let anyone get in the way. His inner drive and passion are both remarkable. I suppose surviving cancer at the age of 18 will do that to you. Hundred Acre fans will find much to admire in this set of new releases. The Hundred Acre Cabernet Sauvignons remain some of the most distinctive wines being made in Napa Valley today.

Proprietor Jayson Woodbridge makes some of the most unique, deeply personal wines in Napa Valley. Very late harvests and minimal intervention in the cellar, including no rackings until bottling, are just some of the choices that inform these wines. Woodbridge’s vineyards are in St. Helena (Kayli Morgan), the lower part of Howell Mountain (Ark) and Calistoga (Few and Far Between). Woodbridge is less reliant on outside consultants than many of his colleagues, so the wines bear very specific signatures that are unlike those of other wines being made in the Valley. The late harvests give the wines super-ripe fruit that can at times veer towards sweetness, but it is the extreme silkiness and finesse of the tannins that differentiates these wines. Woodbridge believes wines must be ready to go upon release and frowns upon decanting or advance aeration, which he doesn’t think should be necessary. As outstanding as these wines can be upon release, the reality is that the wines have also proven to age exceptionally well. I tasted a huge number of wines with Woodbridge and his team, but it was two wines with some bottle age (the 2000 and 2006 Kayli Morgan) that made the deepest impression. I hope Hundred Acre fans can find the discipline to put away a few bottles. The transformation of these wines in bottle is remarkable. These no-holds-barred Cabernets aren’t for everyone, but they are compelling and highly individualistic, just like Woodbridge himself.

From meticulous harvesting berry by berry rather than grape bunch by grape bunch, to an obsessive/compulsive barrel regime as well as winemaking, Hundred Acre is the Napa outpost of visionary and a genius – Jayson Woodbridge. In addition to his original 9-acre Kayli Morgan Vineyard east of St. Helena, he has added a 15-acre parcel on Howell Mountain, and another parcel near the Eisele Vineyard in the northeastern end of Napa Valley called Few and Far Between. Jayson Woodbridge, never content to just make one Cabernet Sauvignon, has added a few other cuvees, one called Deep Time, which is essentially his commitment to very long barrel-aged Cabernet Sauvignon, and Precious, a selection of primarily the best barrels in the cellar. There is even another project, called Fortunate Son, which is another long barrel-aged wine made from selections Woodbridge makes. Perhaps all this is too much for many people, as these are relatively limited selections. Yet, most importantly, these wines are characterized by extraordinarily silky tannins, and an opulence and voluptuous texture that are irresistible. Moreover, they are capable of lasting for two decades in top vintages, such as 2007 and 2008. All the 2007s except for the Deep Time and Fortunate Son are in bottle, and are living up to the high promise of this stunningly opulent, showy, complex vintage. 2008 is another super-strong vintage for most of Napa Valley’s top Cabernet producers. It is just a notch below 2007 for most producers although some have matched and even eclipsed their 2007 counterparts.

Most of these wines spend 38-40 months in barrel and as a result seem to be remarkably elegant and complex without showing any new oak. This cuvee is a selection from Kayli Morgan that has been aged longer. Notes of spice box, white chocolate, espresso and sweet black cherries and black currants tumble from the glass of this full-bodied, round, generously endowed wine that has no hard edges. It should continue to drink well for another 12-15+ years.

One of California’s (perhaps the world’s) most flamboyant, talented, contrarian wine producers is Napa Valley’s Jayson Woodbridge, the owner of Hundred Acre winery. Woodbridge has been running in high gear since his debut 2000. His 100% Cabernet Sauvignons are made primarily by him, with some consulting advice from Philippe Melka. His first effort was from his home vineyard, Kayli Morgan, which is situated east of St. Helena. That offering was followed by a Cabernet from the 15 acre Ark Vineyard on Howell Mountain. Woodbridge recently purchased a tiny, well-situated hillside parcel above the Eisele Vineyard, southeast of Calistoga. His special projects include the Cabernet Sauvignon Precious (in issue #174 I mistakenly called it “Previous”), a wine harvested grape by grape rather than bunch by bunch, and his Cabernet Sauvignon Deep Time, which sees extended oak aging (36-42 months). All things considered, this is an extraordinary group of wines. They are not easy to secure unless you are on Hundred Acre’s mailing list, but they are truly profound offerings that showcase a variety of Napa Valley terroirs as well as different harvesting and barrel aging techniques. The newest enterprise is the Dark Matter Zinfandel, a Zinfandel that is pushed to the limits of ripeness from the high elevations of Howell Mountain. The most common characteristic among all of the Hundred Acre Cabernet Sauvignons is their incredibly opulent, creamy textures. That character vindicates Woodbridge’s harvesting decisions as he seems to achieve extraordinarily sweet, noble tannins in all of his wines. There are approximately 250 cases of Jayson Woodbridge’s special projects, including the Precious and Deep Time cuvees

Displaying deep, earthy, pepper, black raspberry, cherry, and forest floor notes, it could be mistaken for a top-class Pinot Noir or red Burgundy. Extremely complex by Zinfandel standards, this medium to full-bodied effort reveals no evidence of oak aging, and it finishes with tremendous balance in spite of its substantial size and fruit. This wine is still in barrel!

83,Domaine des Lambrays,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret,"The 2018 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret is also showing very well, exhibiting notes of citrus oil, fresh pastry, crisp green orchard fruit and a subtle framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with racy acids, chalky structure and a beautifully defined finish.",,RP (93-95)
84,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"Aromas of cassis, sweet berry fruit, violets, spices and creamy new oak introduce the 2018 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups, a medium to full-bodied, lively wine that's built around fine-grained tannins and lively acids, concluding with a delicately oak-inflected finish.",,RP (93-95)
85,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"Bursting with aromas of ripe berry fruit, spices and a deft touch of creamy new oak, the 2018 Morey-Saint-Denis Village is medium-bodied, fleshy and open-knit, with a ripe core of fruit and youthfully chewy tannins. This will drink well with minimal bottle age.",,RP (93-95)
86,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"The 2017 Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru opens in the glass with expressive aromas of sweet berry fruit, plums and orange rind that mingle with nuances of forest floor, smoked meats, cedar and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, supple and open-knit, with succulent acids and moderate concentration, concluding with a nicely defined finish. I expect this to flesh out a little as it bounces back from bottling.",,RP (93-95)
87,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"A pretty, perfumed and impressively deep wine, the 2021 Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru wafts from the glass with aromas of dark plummy fruit mingled with rose petals, bergamot, cinnamon and cloves. Full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a fleshy core of fruit that's framed by powdery tannins and lively acids, it concludes with good persistence.",,RP (93-95)
88,Domaine des Lambrays,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru La Richemone,"Another new cuvée, including some very old vines planted in 1924, is the 2021 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru La Richemone, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and ample wine evocative of rose petals, wild berries, baking spices and dried herbs. With powdery tannins and succulent acids, it is quite strongly marked by the inclusion of some 70% whole clusters.",,RP (93-95)
89,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"Aromas of rose petals, sweet red berries, cinnamon and clove introduce the 2021 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups, a medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy wine that's supple and perfumed, structured around powdery tannins and concluding with a saline finish.",,RP (93-95)
90,Domaine des Lambrays,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret,"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Caillerets, from vines planted in 1947, has a very different nose to the Folatières with apple blossom, white peach and apricot scents. The palate is underpinned by a keen salinity, very structured with more mineral/limestone towards the finish. This is another superb white from Thierry, perhaps even more bewitching than the Folatières.",,RP (87-89)
91,Domaine des Lambrays,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Bottled four weeks previously, the 2014 Puligny Montrachet les Folatières 1er Cru (from vines between Château de Puligny-Montrachet and Chartron and over Paul Pernot) has a refined bouquet with touches of lime and orange cordial that gain intensity in the glass. The palate is tensile on the entry, fine mineralité, a touch of salinity here mixed with lemon rind and a crisp, focused finish that fans out with confidence. This is a very appealing, tensile Puligny from Thierry Brouin.",,RP (87-89)
92,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"The 2014 Morey St Denis Village, which sees one-third new oak and was completely destemmed, has a blackberry and cranberry-scented bouquet that is neatly entwined with the wood. There is a pastille-like purity at play here. The palate is taut and crisp, lively in the mouth with a citric thread interwoven through the blackcurrant fruit; it is quite sharp and just a little abrupt on the finish at the moment, but that will flesh out by the time of bottling.",,RP (87-89)
93,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"The 2014 Morey St Denis 1er Cru had been bottled one month previously and constitutes six barrels this year, as the young vines that once formed this cru are now elevated into the Grand Cru. It includes 50% whole bunch fruit. Here there is an equal mixture of red and black fruit that is very pure and perfumed, red cherries and crushed strawberry, nicely defined as usual. The palate is medium-bodied with angular tannin, quite pointed acidity and harmonious, but perhaps just missing the harmony of the Village Cru on the finish? There is just a nagging bitter note on the back palate at the moment.",,RP (87-89)
94,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"The bottle of Clos des Lambrays 1949 opened at La Trompette came from Ronald Avery's personal collection and is likely to have never been moved since its original purchase. It was an otherworldly wine blessed with an astonishing bouquet: Vervane tea, jasmine, autumn leaves, damp moss and elderflower all with brilliant clarity after 65 years. The palate rests on super-fine tannin. It is a weightless Clos des Lambrays, feminine and floral, so elegant that you almost miss its length. It has gone way beyond fruit descriptors, more a tactile sensation of harmony and serenity. That's what it tastes like...serenity!",,RP (87-89)
95,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"The 2013 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru has an attractive, slightly candied bouquet with hints of orange blossom infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is well balanced and fresh with a pleasant suppleness. The acidity is well judged at there is just a touch of spice filtering through on the finish. Easygoing, but nicely crafted, this improves all the time in glass and may merit a higher evaluation once in bottle.",,RP (87-89)
96,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"Although there was some reduction on my barrel sample, the 2013 Morey Saint Denis Village has decent mulberry fruit underneath, nice weight in the mouth with plenty of freshness on the rounded, straightforward finish. There is a breeziness to this Village Cru with commendable fruit concentration and I feel more harmony than the 2012. In fact, this is not that far behind the Morey Premier Cru this year.",,RP (87-89)
97,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"Quite pale in color for a grand cru, the Clos des Lambrays 2011 has a very spicy bouquet with touches of wild mint and damp woodland scents coming through with aeration. The palate is light and slightly fleshy: fresh strawberry and red cherry leading to a light, peppery finish. It does lacks some substance at the beginning, although aeration sees it gaining more intensity while retaining its delineation and focus.",,RP (87-89)
98,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"The 2011 Morey-Saint-Denis Village is imbued with a distinctive, sous-bois and cigar-box bouquet that has respectable definition and vigor. The palate has a pastille-like entry with slightly coarse tannins at the moment, a core of strawberry and pomegranate notes lending this light but agreeable Morey village some much-needed fleshiness on the finish. Drink 2015-2022.

99,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"The 2012 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru has a light, tertiary-scented bouquet with broody dark berry fruit that takes a bit of encouragement. The palate is medium-bodied with finer tannins than the village cru. This is quite a pretty wine, full of tension and grace, concluding with an unassuming, neat and linear finish that does not outstay its welcome. Fine. 

Thierry Brouin mourns his half empty ancient cellar that should be full of his 2012 and 2013. It is a sorrowful sight, like a crib without a baby. His wines were not spared the onslaught of disasters that beset the first half of the growing season, so that by the time he commenced the harvest on 20 September he was looking at 15 hectoliters per hectare. To put a couple of figures on that, his usual 15 barrels of Morey Saint Denis were reduced to just two barrels, the Puligny Les Folatieres and Caillerets were so measly they have been blended into a premier cru, whilst there is half the usual quantity of Clos des Lambrays. The style of Thierry’s wines can be uncompromising in their youth and his 2012s, what there remains, are no different. These wines always feel a little “raw” in their youth, quite stemmy and even green, though experience has shown not to draw too many conclusions from this, since they can age beautifully and that raw element ebbs away with time. It is interesting to note, as always, the different approaches between here and Clos de Tart, where Sylvain Pitiot commenced the main harvest eight days later on 28 September, resulting in a different style of wine. You take your pick which one you prefer.

100,Domaine des Lambrays,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru, which had already been bottled, has a fragrant, floral bouquet with ever such a slight “soapy” note that is a little distracting, although it dissipates with modest aeration. The palate is nice and fat on the entry with good matiere, waxy in texture with a creamy, slightly nutty finish that fans out nicely, hints of lime cordial lingering on the aftertaste.

It has a fine bouquet that errs towards black rather than red, with touches of dried herbs and forest floor developing with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied, quite juicy and fleshy on the entry with sour cherry and a touch of tealeaf on the pointed, angular finish. There are usually around 15 barrels of the premier cru, but this year there is all but two.

102,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"Thierry Brouin has crafted a sublime 2010 Clos des Lambrays that should age with grace and style. It has an intense bouquet of wild hedgerow, black cherries, crushed stone and dried flowers that demonstrates even greater delineation and focus than the impressive 2009. The palate has a core of fine tannins, plenty of fresh, red berry fruit and a delicate, focused, terroir-driven finish that has plenty of power and breadth, yet remains contained and never flashy. This is a beautiful Clos des Lambrays that deserves a decade in the cellar?if you can resist temptation! Tasted March 2013.",,RP (87-89)
103,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"The 2009 Clos des Lambrays continues to shine. The self-effacing Thierry Brouin has conjured an exquisite bouquet of wild strawberry, scorched earth, small red cherries and a touch of undergrowth. Brouin’s style is to keep everything contained, natural and unpretentious and so you get a comparatively conservative Clos des Lambrays that is underpinned by light, tensile tannins, with a veneer of red fruit, not great weight but rather weightlessness that is unusual for this vintage. It is in keeping with the domaine’s approach to Pinot Noir, one that I have learned to appreciate more and more with passing years. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (87-89)
104,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"It has been two or three years since I last tasted the Clos des Lambrays 2006 from Domaine des Lambrays. It continues to exhibit a refined bouquet of light red cherries and strawberry, hints of undergrowth and dried autumn leaves. The palate is not as complex as either the 2009 or 2010 tasted alongside, but there is plenty of natural red, leafy fruit and a light, approachable finish that just glides across the mouth with little interest in leaving a long lasting impression. Perhaps a more ephemeral Clos des Lambrays, I would nonetheless take pleasure in opening bottles over the next ten years. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (87-89)
105,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"The 2009 Morey St. Denis Les Loups blossoms onto the palate with generous dark red fruit, dried flowers, licorice and tobacco.

This is a terrific showing. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2022.  

Domaine des Lambrays’s 2010s are outstanding. Yields were down approximately 30% mostly because of the irregular flowering, recounts estate manager Thierry Brouin. The Morey villages was made from entirely destemmed fruit, while the Loups and Clos des Lambrays were vinified with 100% whole bunches. The wine saw approximately 15 days of cuvaison with 5-6 pigeages a day. The wines were chaptalized a little less than one degree.

109,Domaine des Lambrays,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"The 2008 Clos des Lambrays smells of resin, incense, sassafras, and myriad fresh red berries; comes to the palate with terrific brightness, lift, pungency, and verve; and finishes with vibrant spiciness, exuberant sheer juiciness, and admirable clarity. With abundant but fine tannins, I suspect it will justify at least a decade’s attention, during which perhaps mineral and carnal complexities will emerge that are for now at most merely hinted-at. 

Thierry Brouin claims that “extreme selectivity and 4,700 bottles of Bourgogne rose” (of which, however, he didn’t open one for me) was his “formula” for 2008 excellence. I last tasted the wines – some lots of which didn’t finish malo until December – assembled from tank just prior to their March bottling. The 2007s were bottled in that month as well, “proper” wines – notes Brouin – “rendered from fruit that didn’t look very good.”

There is an energetic grip and attack here that goes well beyond the village bottling, but not the latter’s charm or textural allure. Conservatively, I’d look for 6-8 years of interesting evolution.

It’s hard to top this relatively delicate bottling – largely from parcels above the Clos – for sheer charm, especially in the context of its vintage.

115,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"Assembled from the domaine's premier cru holdings in Le Village and La Riotte – below the winery and on the other side of the village from the Clos – the Lambrays 2006 Morey-St.-Denis Les Loups shares with its stable mates a distinctly resinous tone I associate with the inclusion of stems, as well as a vibrant, sappy, long-lasting intensity of ripe, spice-tinged, tartly-edged plum, cherry, and blackberry. Here, an elusive but haunting floral perfume wafts alluringly throughout, and along with the resinous notes, a hint of tar, and the fruit's lashing to a firm raft of tannin put me in mind a bit of really top-notch old-fashioned Barolo. The leanness here will not appeal to all pinotphiles, to be sure. But the invigoration and finishing energy drive a lovely sense of interactive complexity. This would do well to be permitted 2-3 years of bottle rest, and should be worth following for the better part of a decade.  

Thierry Brouin began harvesting ahead of the ban de vendange, yet felt that the stems were sufficiently ripe to retain, which – together with reliance on unbroken clusters – is his preferred means of controlling fermentative extraction. Brouin's haste, though, was also driven by a pressing concern. ""We don't do any spraying against botrytis,"" he explains, ""and in the beginning of September we had a lot of mild rain, and rot … whoosh! So we had to do a really strict selection and lost one-third of a normal yield."" In light of Brouin's explanations, I was not expected what appeared in the glass: wines that easily more than stand qualitative comparison with his 2005s, and furthermore are a lot more fun to drink.

This should be relished over the next 4-6 years.  As Brouin is quick to point out, the young vines, in the Clos are now 27 years old, and this cuvee is only 1,500 bottles.

117,Domaine des Lambrays,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups,"The 2005 Morey-St.-Denis Les Loups functions as the second label of the Clos de Lambrays, combining the fruit of young wines in the Clos with that of two small premier cru parcels near the winery. (So it is in fact 1er Cru in class.) Rhubarb and black cherry aromas usher in an expansive palate displaying smoked meat and bright fruit tinged with cedar, spruce, and brown spices. The abundant tannins are fine-grained and finely-distributed. There is something of a sweet - tart bifurcation on the palate that may resolve itself, and the long finish is invigoratingly savory, juicy, and saline. 

Thierry Brouin fermented largely whole clusters (“I’m a partisan of vendange entier,” he says, “provided the stems are ripe”) and engaged in a more active regimen of punch downs than was typical this year. The result is structure to spare, and wines that make no concessions to early flattery. Unlike the wines of most vintners, Brouin’s 2005s underwent malo-lactic fermentation on a “normal” schedule, i.e. Spring, 2006.

It displays black raspberry, plum, blackberry, and boldly spicy aromas. On the palate, this medium to full-bodied wine is ample, satin-textured, and reveals gorgeous depth as well as richness. Chocolate-covered blackberries are intermingled with spices, asphalt, and black raspberries in its ripe, structured, persistent character. Projected maturity: 2009-2017.

It is medium-bodied, with a well-made candle wax, blackberry, cassis, and hoisin sauce-flavored personality. This spicy, extroverted wine is velvety-textured and appealing. Grand crus of the Cote de Nuits were entitled to 46 hectoliters per hectare yields (including the PLC) and the Domaine des Lambrays produced 45.5 hectoliters per hectare. My impression is that they would have achieved a more concentrated, deeper, and longer finishing wine if their yields had been more moderate. Drink this wine over the course of the next 10-12 years.

Filled with flavors of creamy blackberries, mocha, milk chocolate and sweet red fruits, this delicious wine is made for the near term. It does not have the dry, dusty tannins so common in the '94s. Drink it over the next 6 years. This note is the result of tastings I did in Burgundy between January 7 and January 29. Ratings with a score in parentheses indicate the wine was tasted from cask, not bottle. Pinot Noir, a fragile varietal, reacts poorly to fining, filtration, and careless bottling techniques, I recommend caution when considering buying a red burgundy based on cask samples. I called them as I tasted them, and hope the bottled wine reflects the quality of the samples I was provided.

The raw materials are impressive, but this is one of the Jadot 2016s that will require some patience.",,RP 87
609,Louis Jadot,Côte de Nuits-Villages Le Vaucrain (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted from bottle, the 2016 Côte de Nuits-Villages Le Vaucrain (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing very well indeed, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of earthy cassis, wild plum and licorice. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a deep core of ripe but vibrant fruit, succulent acids and excellent concentration, framed by fine but chalky tannins that are classic Comblanchien. This parcel abuts Mugnier's Clos de la Maréchale, which is classified as a Nuits-Saint-Georges premier cru, and its superior location surely accounts for why this punches so far above its weight.",,RP 87
610,Louis Jadot,Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume (Maison Louis Jadot) is a success in this challenging vintage, unfurling in the glass with aromas of waxy Meyer lemon, iodine and smoke, with only subtle hints of the 2016 muskiness poking through on the upper register. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, bright and incisive, with brisk acids and a chalky finish.",,RP 87
611,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) wafts from the glass with a lovely bouquet of black raspberries, bergamot and potpourri, framed by a judicious application of toasty new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny, with a charmingly textural attack, tangy acids and a precise, mineral finish. It's a lithe, tensile Pernand that will reward some bottle age.",,RP 87
612,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Santenay Clos de Malte Rouge (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing well from bottle, bursting with aromas of ripe cherries, berries, raw cocoa and cinnamon, framed by a subtle touch of cedary new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and vibrant, with a lavishly textural attack, tangy acids and fine-grained but abundant structuring tannins that assert themselves on the finish. This will merit a bit of patience but is a fine value proposition in 2016.",,RP 87
613,Louis Jadot,Monthélie Sous Roches (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Monthélie Sous Roches (Domaine Gagey) is showing well from bottle, though it will require a little patience. Offering up aromas of cherries, cassis, coniferous forest floor and a deft touch of cedary new oak, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a tight-knit core of sappy fruit, fine but youthfully firm tannin and a long, nicely defined finish. Given the wine's substance and structure, I suspect that even as much as a decade's bottle age will bring considerable upside, though it can be enjoyed sooner.",,RP 87
614,Louis Jadot,Beaune Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"From younger vines in premier cru Bressandes, the 2016 Beaune Blanc (Domaine Gagey) exhibits pretty aromas of crisp yellow orchard fruit, almond paste and vanilla pod. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, racy and acid-driven, with a pure, incisive finish. While it's a little angular right now, I suspect it will surprise with three or four years in bottle.",,RP 87
615,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey),"Aromas of cherries, cassis, plums and raw cocoa preface the 2016 Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey), a medium to full-bodied, satiny but incisive red with melting tannins, tangy acids and a nicely concentrated core of fruit. Its vibrant, precise style and refined structure make it a lovely representation of the vintage.",,RP 87
616,Louis Jadot,Santenay (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Santenay (Maison Louis Jadot) is a definite success, bursting from the glass with aromas of juicy cherries, cassis, licorice and warm spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and fruit-driven, with velvety tannins, succulent acids and a flavorful finish. It isn't vinified by Jadot, but they clearly purchase this pleasure-bent and nicely balanced Santenay from a fine source.",,RP 87
617,Louis Jadot,Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of juicy cherries, earthy cassis and ripe plums introduce the 2016 Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied, fleshy wine with a generous core of fruit, succulent acids and a rich chassis of youthfully chewy tannin that asserts itself on a slightly rustic finish. This is a hearty, well-made Pommard, with plenty of fruit and structure, that conforms to the appellation's stereotype.",,RP 87
618,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"Tasted from bottle, the 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin Village (Maison Louis Jadot) offers up a rich bouquet of earthy black fruits, grilled meats and blood orange. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, ample and fleshy, with fine but youthfully chewy tannins, tangy acids and a sapid finish. It can't match the concentration or completeness of Jadot's domaine wines, but it's a creditable effort. While this cuvée is sometimes entirely vinified by Jadot, the 2016 contains some purchased wine.",,RP 87
619,Louis Jadot,Givry Rouge (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Givry Rouge (Maison Louis Jadot) bursts from the glass with aromas of juicy cherries and strawberries. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and melting, with a succulent core of fruit and delicate tannins. It isn't vinified by Jadot, but they evidently purchase from a competent source.",,RP 87
620,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of smoky cassis, espresso roast and rich soil introduce the 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges Village (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied wine with a fleshy core of fruit, tangy acids and chewy tannins. There's a slight touch of backend bitterness and a lack of structural integration that mark this out as a cuvée that was negatively affected by the 2016 frost.",,RP 87
621,Louis Jadot,Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey) offers up notes of apple blossom and citrus oil, followed by a medium-bodied, crisp and tangy palate that's pure and acid-driven. It's a simple but refreshing wine that may prove surprisingly long-lived.",,RP 87
622,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge is a hearty, rustic red that Jadot purchased as wine before completing the élevage and bottling. Offering up aromas of ripe berry fruit and herbs, it's medium to full-bodied with chewy structure and tangy acids. While it can't match the finesse of the wines Jadot vinify themselves, I suspect time will be kind to it.",,RP 87
623,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Clos du Roy (Domaine Gagey),"Marsannay was one of the hardest hit appellations in this vintage's defining frosts, and the rather firm, angular structural profile of the 2016 Marsannay Clos du Roy (Domaine Gagey) likely reflects grapes that ripened unevenly. Opening in the glass with high-toned aromas of red and black berry fruit, it's medium to full-bodied with tangy acids and fine but firm tannins that don't quite form a coherent whole. It's not a bad wine, but it falls short of the standard Jadot routinely attains with this climat.",,RP 87
624,Louis Jadot,Auxey-Duresses Rouge (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Auxey-Duresses Rouge (Maison Louis Jadot) offers up aromas of red berries, plums and herbs, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's somewhat tangy and austere, seemingly impacted by the year's spring frosts. It's a solid effort with challenging raw materials, but nothing more.",,RP 87
625,Louis Jadot,Côte de Beaune-Villages (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Côte de Beaune-Villages (Maison Louis Jadot) is produced from purchased wine, and it isn't as integrated as the wines Jadot vinifies in house. Aromas of creamy new oak vie with juicy red fruits for the taster's attention, followed by a medium-bodied, fleshy but rather simple palate, with melting tannins and tangy acids. It's not bad, but there are many better reds in the range.",,RP 87
626,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2017 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is very serious indeed, unfurling in the glass with notes of yellow citrus fruits and white flowers that mingle with hints of crushed chalk, framed by smoky new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with searing concentration, chewy dry extract and bright acids, concluding with a long, authoritative finish. This powerful and structured Chevalier will require some bottle age.",,RP 87
627,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Aromas of blood orange, rose petals and ripe wild berries introduce the 2017 Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot), a full-bodied, deep and layered wine with superb depth and mid-palate amplitude, a generous core of sappy fruit and fine, chalky structuring tannins. It's a gorgeous Musigny that might well develop along the lines of the superb 2000 rendition. Barnier told me that this was one of the few cuvées chez Jadot that saw some whole cluster this year.",,RP 87
628,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is excellent, displaying a lovely bouquet of lemon oil, white flowers, crushed chalk and a discrete touch of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, tensile and tight-knit, with chewy structuring dry extract, tangy acids and a long, grippy finish. This is built for the cellar and will be well worth seeking out.",,RP 87
629,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"One of the finest wines in the Jadot portfolio, the 2017 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) unfurls in the glass with aromas of sweet red berries, menthol, dark chocolate, blood orange and grilled meats. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with superb depth and dimension, succulent acids and notable concentration, its tannins entirely cloaked in fruit. While this is a comparatively supple, giving rendition of this cuvée, it will nevertheless demand patience.",,RP 87
630,Louis Jadot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"There are eight barrels of the excellent 2017 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot), an impressive wine that unfurls in the glass with aromas of crisp yellow orchard fruit, pear, pastry cream and honeycomb. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and satiny, with more concentration and cut than this year's Bienvenues, with an elegant sense of completeness and a long, lively finish. This will be well worth seeking out.",,RP 87
631,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot) unfurls in the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of sweet red berries, coffee roast, raw cocoa, candied peel and cedary new wood. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with an abundance of satiny structuring tannin, juicy acids and a long, pure finish. As usual, this will require some bottle age, but it's one of the high points of the collection.",,RP 87
632,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) was showing well, displaying aromas of ripe wild berries, cherries, candied peel and dark chocolate framed by some creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and nicely concentrated, with good depth at the core, fine structuring tannins and a long, energetic finish. This numbers among the portfolio's high points this year.",,RP 87
633,Louis Jadot,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) is excellent, and one of the high points of the range, unwinding in the glass with a reserved bouquet of cherries, red berries, peony and orange rind, with a little hint of the savory complexity to come. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a tight-knit, chalky but multidimensional core underpinned by bright animating acids, concluding with a long, mineral finish. This will need a decade or more in bottle to unwind but will be excellent in the fullness of time.",,RP 87
634,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot) unfurls in the glass with aromas of tart pear, green apple, honeycomb, spices and fresh peach.

635,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is a worthy successor to the superb 2016 rendition, unfurling in the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of lemon oil, vanilla pod, dried white flowers and gingerbread. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with an elegantly glossy attack, wonderful concentration and a bright line of animating acidity, concluding with a long and pure finish. This is one of Jadot's finest white premiers crus this year.",,RP 87
636,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of crisp peach, mandarin oil, orange blossom and mint introduce the 2017 Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot), a full-bodied, ample wine with a broad, textural attack and juicy balancing acids, though it can't match the density or cut of the stunning Chevalier Demoiselles from domaine fruit.",,RP 87
637,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up aromas of ripe citrus fruits, white flowers and crushed chalk, framed by smoky new oak.

Exhibiting aromas of raspberries, orange rind, dried flowers and creamy new oak, it's medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny, with fine but youthfully firm tannins and a long, precise finish. It was quite marked by its wood when I tasted it, but I suspect that will have settled down by the time it's bottled.",,RP 87
640,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes (Domaine Gagey) opens in the glass with a youthfully reticent bouquet of red cherries, raspberries, licorice and spices.

645,Louis Jadot,Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2018 Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot) appears to be one of the weaker links of the négoce range this year, revealing a rather figgy, roasted bouquet of dark fruits, baking chocolate and prunes. On the palate, it's full-bodied and seemingly a touch overripe. There is only one barrel this year.",,RP 87
646,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2018 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly (Maison Louis Jadot) was the one obvious weak link in this year's portfolio, as despite showing well on the nose, it was austere and angular on the palate.

On the palate, it's medium-bodied, with a tensile, tangy profile, its bright core of fruit only partially concealing its youthfully chewy tannins. Structurally, it's typical Grèves and will require a bit of bottle age before revealing its quality.",,RP (91-93)
672,Louis Jadot,Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey) wafts from the glass with aromas of raspberries, cranberries, dried flowers and spices. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, satiny and fleshy, with juicy acids and fine-grained tannins. It's a strong effort.",,RP (91-93)
673,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine Gagey),"This was a strong showing for the 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot), a wine that offers up an attractive bouquet of plums, pomegranate, candied peel and spices. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, ample and generous, with a charming, open-knit profile and juicy balancing acids.",,RP (91-93)

675,Louis Jadot,Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up a classic bouquet of red berries, blood orange and coniferous forest floor.

677,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"Aromas of buttered lemons, honeycomb and anise introduce the 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey), a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and expressive wine that's succulent but open-knit, concluding with good length on the finish.

678,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) reveals a generous bouquet of smoky blackberries and plum, complemented by savory bass notes of loamy soil and espresso roast. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, quite ample and succulent with a plush, giving profile. It can't match the finesse or completeness of the Cras, but it's very true to the hearty, gourmand style of the site.",,RP (91-93)
679,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Rugiens (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Pommard 1er Cru Rugiens (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up aromas of sweet cherries, espresso roast and rich soil tones. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and succulent, with moderate concentration and chalky structuring tannins.",,RP (91-93)
680,Louis Jadot,Fixin Clos Moreau Monopole (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of fresh apples, tart peach, citrus oil and crushed chalk introduce the 2017 Fixin Clos Moreau (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium-bodied, mouthwatering white with a taut line of acidity and chewy extract that should enjoy a decade or more of longevity. It's further testimony to Fixin's unheralded potential for white wine.",,RP (91-93)
681,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Notes of sweet red berries and plums mingling with notions of spicy forest floor and licorice introduce the 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot), a medium-bodied, succulent wine with an open-knit profile and a sapid finish.

686,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode (Domaine Louis Jadot) displays appealing aromas of smoky cherries, grilled meats and warm spices, followed by a medium-bodied, structured palate that was a little firm and austere when I tasted it. Given this cuvée's track record, I suspect it will flesh out appreciably by the time it's bottled.",,RP (91-93)
687,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of yellow orchard fruit, mint, white flowers and spices introduce the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied, fleshy wine with a succulent core of fruit, juicy acids and a clean, delineated finish.",,RP (91-93)

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, firm and a little ephemeral. It isn't the high point of the range.",,RP (91-93)
690,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"A cuvée which consists of 80% premier cru juice, the 2017 Saint-Aubin Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot) offers up aromas of green orchard fruit, toasted nuts, chamomile and light framing reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, taut and tangy, with a crisp, mineral finish. Despite its comparatively modest appellation, it was one of the more reserved wines in the range, and it appears to have excellent potential.",,RP (91-93)
691,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Combottes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Pernand-Vergelesses Les Combottes (Domaine Gagey) reveals aromas of white flowers, ripe citrus fruits, fresh pastry and melon.

This is a comparatively open, suave rendition of Referts from Jadot, and it will show well out of the gates.",,RP (91-93)
694,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée (Maison Louis Jadot),"Introducing the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée (Maison Louis Jadot) are notes of fresh melon, pear and peach mingling with nuances of drawn butter and white flowers in an incipiently complex bouquet. This is a medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny-textured wine that's vibrant, nicely concentrated and quite dramatic in style. There are just two barrels, but the wine will be worth seeking out.",,RP (91-93)
695,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc (Domaine Gagey) is more reserved than the Bressandes, unfurling in the glass with notes of honeyed citrus, praline and subtle new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and succulent, with tangy acids—malolactic fermentation was partially blocked—and good length on the finish. This is always an insider's choice in the Jadot lineup, and this rendition is no exception.",,RP (91-93)
696,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up attractive aromas of red plums, wild berries, citrus rind and coniferous forest floor.

697,Louis Jadot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"There are two barrels of the 2017 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot), a dramatic wine that bursts from the glass with aromas of ripe yellow orchard fruit, mandarin, spices and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ripe and textural, with a fleshy, open-knit profile and a saline finish. This will be a crowd-pleaser in its youth, but with more cut and tension—which it may acquire with further élevage—it would score higher.",,RP (91-93)
698,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of orange rind, red berries, peony and forest floor introduce the 2017 Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot), a full-bodied, open-knit and giving wine that's a definite success, but it can't match the depth or profundity of the domaine Clos de Bèze.",,RP (91-93)
699,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is the high point of Jadot's Beaune portfolio, offering up an incipiently complex bouquet of raspberries, plums, candied peel, licorice, grilled meats and warm spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with an ample core of fruit that's structured around a youthfully firm chassis of chalky tannin, concluding with a long finish. This should age very gracefully.",,RP (91-93)
700,Louis Jadot,Corton-Clos du Roi Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"One of the decided successes of the négociant portfolio this year is the 2017 Corton-Clos du Roi Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot), a lovely wine that offers up a complex nose of dark berries, red cherry, dried flowers, forest floor and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and detailed, with good concentration, a fine-grained chassis of chalky tannin and a long finish. This is an insider's choice that will be worth seeking out.",,RP (87-89)
701,Louis Jadot,Auxey-Duresses Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of green orchard fruit, wet stones and a judicious touch of smoky oak introduce the 2017 Auxey-Duresses Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied, wine with an elegantly textural attack and nice depth and dimension at the core, albeit a little fleeting on the finish.",,RP (87-89)
702,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Sentiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of spicy raspberries and pomegranate introduce the 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Sentiers (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied wine that's somewhat firm and austere this year. It can't match Jadot's Chambolle bottlings from their own vineyards.",,RP (87-89)
703,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of orange rind, spicy wild berries and licorice introduce the 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium-bodied, ample wine with a fleshy, moderately concentrated core of fruit and chewy tannins that assert themselves on the finish.",,RP (87-89)
704,Louis Jadot,Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey) is attractive, displaying aromas of crisp green apple, citrus zest and a judicious touch of oak, followed by a medium-bodied palate with juicy acids, a succulent core of fruit and a chalky finish. It's a very creditable example of the appellation.",,RP (87-89)
705,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Santenots (Domaine Louis Jadot),"A new domaine bottling derived from the holdings of Prieur-Brunet, the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up aromas of plums, licorice and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and supple on the attack, segueing into a firmer, chewier and tighter-knit mid-palate and finish. I suspect it will take a few years of farming improvements before this cuvée assumes the place its appellation merits in the Jadot portfolio.",,RP (87-89)
706,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey),"Aromas of sweet berry fruit, spices and espresso roast introduce the 2017 Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey), a medium-bodied wine with a juicy core of fruit and youthfully chewy tannins that I suspect will flesh out somewhat by the time it's bottled.",,RP (87-89)
707,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts (Maison Louis Jadot),"Jadot's 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts (Maison Louis Jadot) bursts with expressive aromas of plummy fruit intermingled with Asian spices, smoked duck and orange rind. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, open-knit and supple, but it lacks some concentration and intensity. It's an easygoing middleweight that will drink well in its youth.",,RP (87-89)
708,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of spicy berry fruit introduce the 2017 Vosne-Romanée Village (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium-bodied, supple and open-knit wine with juicy acids and melting tannins. It will drink well on release.",,RP (87-89)
709,Louis Jadot,Volnay Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Volnay Village (Maison Louis Jadot) displays notes of dark berries, espresso roast, forest floor and smoky new oak, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's quite firm and structural, with chewy tannins and tangy acids. It's a little austere but may come around in time.",,RP (87-89)
710,Louis Jadot,Chorey-lès-Beaune Beaumonts (Domaine Gagey),"The 2017 Chorey-lès-Beaune Beaumonts (Domaine Gagey) displays notions of sweet cherries, cassis and loamy soil, followed by a medium-bodied, firm and chewy palate that hasn't entirely tamed this appellation's tendency to rusticity.",,RP (87-89)
711,Louis Jadot,Saint-Romain (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of ripe lemons, citrus blossom and pastry cream introduce the 2017 Saint-Romain (Maison Louis Jadot), a light to medium-bodied wine that was a little too tangy and ephemeral for its own good when I tasted it.",,RP (87-89)
712,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted from bottle, the 2016 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing marvelously, unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of juicy cherries, cassis, blood orange, violets and rich spices, its framing of new oak already almost entirely integrated. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and utterly complete, with a bottomless core of cool, sappy fruit that entirely conceals its supple but abundant tannins. Immensely concentrated and strikingly structurally refined, this is a brilliant Clos de Bèze that's more classically balanced than the more overtly ripe 2015.",,RP (87-89)
713,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing even better from bottle than it did from barrel, unfurling in the glass with a lovely and expressive bouquet of cherries, dark chocolate, incense and subtle hints of smoky new oak and clove. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and velvety with a deep core of fruit, tangy but ripe acids and a long, penetrating finish. It's a beautifully elegant and direct example of Chapelle-Chambertin, from a parcel planted in 1920-1921 where most of the old vines remain intact.",,RP (87-89)
714,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is excellent, unwinding in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of ripe cherries, wild berries and bergamot, complemented by savory bass notes of mossy forest floor, espresso roast and grilled squab. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and tight-knit, with excellent amplitude and dimension, fine-grained but firm structuring tannins and a penetrating, mineral finish. The potential here is very fine indeed but this is not a wine for those seeking immediate gratification and a decade of patience will be in order.",,RP (87-89)
715,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is showing superbly from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of fragrant citrus fruit, crisp green apple, white flowers and subtle pastry cream. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with a satiny texture, excellent concentration and a seamless, elegant profile. Jadot has several parcels in Folatières, so this is an important cuvée for them. It's well worth seeking out.",,RP (87-89)
716,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Aromas of yellow orchard fruit, waxy lemon rind, iodine and smoky new oak introduce the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot), a full-bodied, satiny and nicely layered wine that's deep, concentrated and persistent.

717,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) is showing very well indeed from bottle, wafting from the glass with a beautifully pure bouquet of red cherries, plums, subtle spices and citrus peel that only hint at the tertiary complexity to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegant and velvety, with excellent depth at the core, succulent acids and a long, precise finish. The sheer finesse of this Clos des Ursules' tannins is really quite striking, but while that renders it deceptively approachable now, the real excitement will come with the better part of a decade of bottle age.",,RP (87-89)
718,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle (Duc de Magenta),"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle (Domaine du Duc de Magenta) is showing very well from bottle, unfurling in the glass with aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, marzipan, beeswax and a subtle framing of smoky oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, dense and thickly textured, with imposing concentration and chewy dry extract but balanced by succulent acids, concluding with a long, mineral finish. While the frost has made this atypically concentrated, this Morgeot remains in balance and appears to have all the necessary elements for a very interesting evolution in bottle.",,RP (87-89)
719,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing well from bottle, unwinding in the glass with a youthfully primary bouquet of ripe cherries, red berries, candied peel and cassis that's subtly framed by some nicely integrated new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and satiny textured, its broad-shouldered chassis of impressively fine-grained tannin cloaked in a succulent, even tangy core of vibrant fruit, concluding with a long and nicely defined finish. While the structure is sufficiently refined that drinking a glass now isn't a brutalizing experience, a decade of patience is recommended.",,RP (87-89)
720,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"From bottle, the 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing very well, unfurling in the glass with notes of waxy lemon rind, crisp pear, crushed chalk and white flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and tensile, with a bright line of acidity and a long, stony finish.",,RP (87-89)
721,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"From bottle, the 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing beautifully, offering up a youthful but expressive bouquet of dark wild berries, currant leaf, coniferous forest floor and subtle hints of peony. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny with a generous core of cool, sappy fruit, melting tannins and a beautifully defined finish. It's a beautifully complete, elegant Estournelles Saint-Jacques that confirms its terrific performance from barrel. While it's sufficiently supple to be approachable now, a decade of patience will be rewarded by considerably greater complexity.",,RP (87-89)
722,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Garenne (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Garenne (Maison Louis Jadot) is showing well from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of honeyed citrus fruit, crisp yellow apples, blanched almonds and a subtle framing of new wood. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, pure and nicely concentrated, with tangy acids and a tight-knit, tensile core. Classic in profile, this will reward some bottle age.",,RP (87-89)
723,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Embazées (Maison Louis Jadot),"From bottle, the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Embazées (Maison Louis Jadot) is showing well, unfurling in the glass with aromas of yellow orchard fruits, mint, almond paste and spice. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and supple, with an elegantly glossy attack that segues into an open-knit, expressive mid-palate and a pure, saline finish. This hails from effectively the sole sector of Chassagne-Montrachet to escape the 2016 frosts.",,RP (87-89)
724,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes Blanc (Domaine Gagey) is showing very well, unfurling in the glass with aromas of dried white flowers, yellow orchard fruit, confit lemon and toasted nuts. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and gourmand, with a textural attack, tangy acids and a long, saline finish. It's a definite success that will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP (87-89)
725,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot) offers up an appealing bouquet of ripe cherries, blackcurrants, ripe citrus and wood smoke. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and succulent, with an ample core of fruit, satiny tannins and vibrant acids, concluding with a nicely delineated, mouthwatering finish. This is an elegant, charming Beaune that will reward at least a few years' bottle age and offer a broad drinking window.",,RP (87-89)
726,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot (Maison Louis Jadot) is decisively marked by the vintage, offering up an exotic bouquet of honeyed peaches, apricot and citrus blossom. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and unctuous, with broad shoulders and a generous attack, but balanced by incisive acids that lend the wine a structural tension that belies its musky, super-concentrated profile. In a sense, this is a decidedly atypical Chablis, even by the standards of Blanchot—yet it displays characteristics that were prized in vintages such as 1986 and even 1992; and while this 2016 is never going to rival the great wines from vintages such as that, it may well surprise with bottle age. Deduct or add several points depending on your affinity for exoticism and texture.",,RP (87-89)
727,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"From bottle, the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot) is showing well, offering up an expressive bouquet of buttered orchard fruit, honeyed peaches and beeswax. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, rich and unctuous, with a dramatic, textural attack, a fleshy mid-palate and a lavish finish. This is marked by the frost but has turned out well, making for a gourmand Chassagne that will offer near-term gratification.",,RP (87-89)
728,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte Blanc (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted from bottle, the 2016 Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Louis Jadot) can't quite match the cut and concentration of the 2017 rendition, but it's a pretty wine, offering up aromas of green orchard fruits, toasted nuts and freshly baked bread. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, glossy and open-knit, with a giving profile and a pure finish. It's already drinking well.",,RP (87-89)
729,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre Blanc (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Pernand-Vergelesses Clos de la Croix de Pierre (Domaine Louis Jadot) is quite ripe and gourmand, likely due to the year's small yields, offering up a honeyed bouquet of waxy lemon rind, white flowers and creamy new wood. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, open-knit and fleshy, with juicy acids and a pure, saline finish. This is already drinking well.",,RP (87-89)
730,Louis Jadot,Meursault Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Meursault Village (Maison Louis Jadot) is showing well from bottle, unfurling in the glass with pretty scents of fresh peach, buttered green orchard fruit and almond paste. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, textural and fleshy, with brisk acids, good depth at the core and a moderately long, chewy finish. This is a fine effort in a challenging year.",,RP (87-89)
731,Louis Jadot,Chablis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chablis (Maison Louis Jadot) is defined by the vintage, bursting with exotic, musky aromas of honeyed peaches, apricots, barley sugar and spices. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, ample and fleshy with a generous core of fruit, surprisingly brisk acids and a saline finish. It's decidedly atypical—one could easily pin it as a Viré-Clessé in a blind tasting—but it's a well-made effort in one of the most challenging growing seasons of the decade. Of 30,000 cases, fully 3,500 were imported to the USA, so it's one of Jadot's more abundantly available cuvées.",,RP (87-89)
732,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2011 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) offers up lovely aromas of cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and satiny, with juicy acids, a fleshy core of fruit and deceptively melting tannins, concluding with a long, generous finish. While it isn't a historic vintage for this routinely superb bottling, it's a beautiful wine that is already accessible and which will continue to drink with grace for two decades.",,RP (87-89)
733,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"This was a great showing from the 2000 Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot), a beautiful wine that bursts with aromas of candied peel, juicy cherries, dark chocolate and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a layered core that's still framed by some fine but firm structuring tannins, showing its pedigree above all on the strikingly long, intense finish.",,RP (87-89)
734,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 1999 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot) is still surprisingly firm and structural, unfurling in the glass with aromas of red and black fruits, orange rind, grilled meat and rich soil tones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with excellent intensity and persistence, but it's still somewhat tight-knit, its chewy chassis of chalky structuring tannin making its inherent amplitude and volume harder to see. Unsurprisingly, the Clos de Bèze is the most reticent of Jadot's very successful 1999 portfolio, and readers with bottles in their cellar will find the wine more rewarding in another decade. While this will never be a lavish, opulent wine, it will be very long lived.",,RP (87-89)
735,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind, the 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Demoiselles performed extremely well, offering up a reserved bouquet of white flowers, preserved citrus, toasted nuts and oak vanillin. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, powerful and very concentrated, with a deep, multidimensional mid-palate, racy acids and a long, saline finish. This is carrying quite an overt framing of new wood, but it's a seriously structured and beautifully balanced Chevalier-Montrachet that will warmly reward patience. It's bottled under Diam 30.",,RP (87-89)
736,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind, Jadot's 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques confirmed the seriousness it displayed earlier this year, unwinding with aeration to reveal a youthfully reserved bouquet of sweet red fruits, raw cocoa, rich soil and dried rose petal, framed by a judicious application of cedary new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, reserved and concentrated, with fine-grained but firm structuring tannins, tangy acids and impressive length. This Clos Saint-Jacques is shutting down, so it's all about future potential, but its showing in this tasting suggested that when all is said and done, it may well be the Clos Saint-Jacques of the vintage.",,RP (87-89)
737,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais-Quincé (Maison Louis Jadot),"The higher-altitude sites that inform Jadot's 2017 Beaujolais-Quincé have really delivered in this warm vintage, producing a wine that wafts from the glass with aromas of orange zest, ripe Griotte cherries, raspberries and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and tangy, with good concentration and length. It's well worth seeking out.",,RP (87-89)
738,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais-Lantignié (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Beaujolais-Lantignié offers up aromas of ripe cherries, licorice, potpourri and orange rind. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and juicy, with a rich, layered profile and good length on the finish.",,RP (87-89)
739,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais-Villages (Maison Louis Jadot),"Bursting with aromas of cherries, cassis and raspberries, the 2017 Beaujolais-Villages is medium-bodied, pure and fruit driven, with juicy acids, ripe tannins and a friendly, giving profile. Enjoy it now or over the next handful of years.",,RP (87-89)
740,Louis Jadot,Coteaux Bourgignons Rosé (Maison Louis Jadot),"Produced from whole-cluster pressed Gamay that's fermented in stainless steel, the 2017 Coteaux Bourgignons Rosé is an attractive quaffer that offers up pretty aromas and flavors of sweet red berries and fresh peach. It's dry, medium-bodied and mouthwateringly succulent. Bottled under screwcap and sold for a modest price, it's intended for near-term consumption.",,RP (87-89)
741,Louis Jadot,Pouilly-Fuissé (Maison Louis Jadot),"Generous and expressive, the 2016 Pouilly-Fuissé reveals pretty aromas of buttered orchard fruit and honeysuckle, followed by a full-bodied, ample and succulent palate that's laden with fruit but balanced by juicy, mouthwatering acids. The finish is pure and tangy, still revealing a touch of struck match from its bottling. It's more buxom and old-fashioned in style than the chiseled wines being produced by the talented Audrey Braccini at Jadot's Domaine Ferret, but Jadot is clearly taking this Pouilly-Fuissé very seriously, and it will reward following for the next 5 years.",,RP (87-89)
742,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Chardonnay (Maison Louis Jadot),"Revealing attractive aromas of musky peach, white flowers and yellow orchard fruit, the 2016 Bourgogne Chardonnay is medium to full-bodied, ample and glossy, with succulent acids and an open-knit and generously fruit-driven profile. It's a blend of wine from the Côte d'Or, Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais that spends 12 months in barrel.",,RP (87-89)
743,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (Maison Louis Jadot) bursts with wild aromas of incense, smoked meats, dark chocolate and grilled game, followed by a medium-bodied, firm and chewy palate with a chunky, old-fashioned profile and a carnal finish.",,RP (87-89)
744,Louis Jadot,Aloxe-Corton Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of sweet cassis, rich soil, espresso roast and grilled squab introduce the 2017 Aloxe-Corton Village (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied wine that's nicely concentrated, its impressively fleshy core of fruit framed by fine but abundant tannins. It isn't easy to find such a supple but intense example of Aloxe-Corton Village, so this is a truly impressive effort from Jadot.",,RP (87-89)
745,Louis Jadot,Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot) exhibits notes of spicy red berry fruit and sweet forest floor, followed by a medium-bodied, succulent wine with chewy tannins but nice flesh on its structural bones. This Maison cuvée is built around a foundation derived from domaine holdings in the lieu-dit Noizons.",,RP (87-89)
746,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Petite Chapelle (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Petite Chapelle (Maison Louis Jadot) reveals notes of sweet flowers and earthy berries, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's somewhat firm and chewy, lacking a bit of flesh.",,RP (87-89)
747,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Gagey) displays aromas of sweet red berries, citrus rind and spices, followed by a medium-bodied, ample and velvety palate that's pure, succulent and nicely delineated.",,RP (87-89)
748,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"More reserved and austere than Jadot's other Gevrey premiers crus, the 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers (Maison Louis Jadot) exhibits notes of sweet berries, plums, coniferous forest floor and wood smoke, followed by a medium-bodied, chewy palate that may flesh out by the time it's bottled.",,RP (87-89)
749,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazeys (Domaine Gagey),"Aromas of sweet red berries and blood orange introduce the 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazeys (Domaine Gagey), a satiny, medium-bodied wine with supple tannins and a juicy core of fruit that's open-knit and giving, with plenty of charm but missing the amplitude and persistence of a top vintage.",,RP (87-89)
750,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Les Longeroies (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2017 Marsannay Les Longeroies (Domaine Louis Jadot) displays aromas of smoky oak, wild berries and coniferous forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, tangy and a little angular but nicely concentrated. I suspect it will flesh out by the time it's bottled.",,RP (87-89)
751,Louis Jadot,Auxey-Duresses Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"Aromas of green orchard fruit, wet stones and a judicious touch of smoky oak introduce the 2017 Auxey-Duresses Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot), a medium to full-bodied, wine with an elegantly textural attack and nice depth and dimension at the core, albeit a little fleeting on the finish.",,RP 87
752,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières from Louis Jadot offers up notes of pear, preserved citrus, frangipane and nutty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and textural, with good amplitude and depth and nice balancing acidity, though right now it's quite marked by its new oak, with notable vanillin and light phenolic grip on the finish. The raw materials, however, are impressive, and I have confidence that this will become a very satisfying and attractively old-fashioned Genevrières with time.",,RP 87
753,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle (Duc de Magenta),"The 2015 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle is already quite expressive, wafting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of poached pear, vanilla bean, yellow stone fruit and toasted nuts—very similar to its showing from barrel. On the palate, the wine is textural, full-bodied and rich, with notable chewy extract, impressive mid-palate presence, and ripe acids. While this is an undeniably rich, ripe white Burgundy, everything is in harmony and the wine's considerable reserves of concentration and structure make me wonder if it could surprise with bottle age.",,RP 87
754,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"Jadot's 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne from the holdings of the Domaine du Duc de Magenta is a very nice example of the vintage, opening in the glass with aromas of vanilla pod, brioche, preserved lemon and orange zest, framed by new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and textural, with an expansive attack buttressed by succulent acids and a long, penetrating finish. While this is marked by the concentration and ripeness of the vintage, it's nicely controlled.",,RP 87
755,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Domaine des Héritiers Louis Jadot offers up a generous nose of buttered apples, preserved citrus and a creamy framing of new oak, followed on the palate by a full-bodied, rich and ample wine with considerable textural impact and moderate depth at the core, finishing with light grip and noticeable alcoholic warmth. This should evolve into a ripe, generous Corton-Charlemagne with a few years of bottle age, but it's unlikely to be especially long lived and I wouldn't bet on its balance for the long haul.",,RP 87
756,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 1992 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières from Louis Jadot is a lovely bottle of mature Puligny, with a complex bouquet of preserved lemon, honeycomb, wheat toast and brine, leading into a full-bodied, deep wine with nice balance and structural integrity and no sign of fraying through the complex, lingering finish.",,RP 87
757,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Demoiselles was reduced from the usual nine or ten barrels to just two this year because of frost damage. It has higher-toned fruit compared to the Montrachet at the moment: orange blossom, white peach, white flowers and a subtle cold stone scent that becomes more prominent with aeration. The palate is tensile on the entry with very fine focus. There is a pleasant saline note that becomes pronounced on the second half, spicier than I recall the 2015 being last year, with impressive persistence. Excellent.",,RP 87
758,Louis Jadot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru has a clean and pure bouquet with ample smoke-tinged blackberry and raspberry fruit, controlled and focused, the mineral scents emerging with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin, plenty of dusky red fruit laced with graphite, although it deserves more complexity and detail to come through on the finish. That may come with time. It is not up there with the outstanding 2015 but it is still extremely fine.",,RP 87
759,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Montrachet Grand Cru has an intense bouquet with notes of flint, smoke, apple blossom and just a hint of dried apricot, well defined and seeming to expand with aeration. The palate is well balanced with an intense opening that fortunately does not compromise the finesse and elegance of this Montrachet. It almost sashays along, minding its own business, but the acidity is extremely well judged and the finish shows superb precision. Excellent.",,RP 87
760,Louis Jadot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was showing a little more reduction on the nose compared to the Clos Saint-Denis, although I felt that there is more detail and complexity in situ. The palate is very refined with filigree tannin, great tension and focus, a gentle grip in the mouth with an almost tart, tensile finish that lingers in the mouth. I also appreciate the spiciness on the aftertaste. Superb.",,RP 87
761,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers has a very detailed and perfumed bouquet that delivers layers of mineral-driven red berry fruit that really translate the terroir. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, good substance, a little oaky toward the finish but that will be subsumed to leave you with a fine Cazetiers that may surpass the 2015. Superb.",,RP 87
762,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chambertin Grand Cru had a late malolactic and a slight reduction on the nose. That said, there are clearly plenty of blackberry, raspberry and tobacco scents waiting to come out. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe, quite juicy tannin. This is a Chambertin with impressive body and depth, although this year I find more sophistication embroidered into the Clos de Bèze and maybe even the Chapelle-Chambertin.",,RP 87
763,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts has an extravagant bouquet that really shows up the Les Suchots: this is packed full of luscious red cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, a hint of vanilla pod with time. The palate is medium-bodied with plump tannin, fine acidity, impressive body with a dash of white pepper sprinkled liberally over the stocky finish. Excellent.",,RP 87
764,Louis Jadot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a slightly richer and more generous, lightly honeyed bouquet compared to the Bienvenues, though I admire its purity and with aeration, more terroir expression becomes apparent. The palate is slightly viscous on the entry. There is a fine bead of acidity, slightly less saline than the Bienvenues but there is greater depth and puissance on the finish. Give this three or four years in bottle before broaching.",,RP 87
765,Louis Jadot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru has a voluptuous and sensual bouquet, perhaps the most instantly attractive of the quintet of Jadot's grand cru Gevreys that I tasted. There are waves of crushed strawberries, black cherries, blueberry and violet aromas all neatly entwined with the new oak. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy black cherry and boysenberry fruit laced with bay leaf and black tea, becoming more structured and Mazoyères-like on the finish (although it is proper ""Charmes!"").",,RP 87
766,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses has a very elegant bouquet, well defined with perfumed, violet-tinged blue and red fruit. It feels quite understated but it is purring along and gaining intensity with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with supple, ripe tannin, a fine silver bead of acidity but maybe missing some sophistication and complexity toward the finish that leaves you wanting more from this lover. Hopefully it will gain more personality and address the final third during the remainder of its élevage.",,RP 87
767,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques has the most outgoing and maybe most exotic aromatic profiles among Jadot's Gevrey premier crus, with kirsch and fig infusing the red and blackberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, very focused and tensile even if it does not quite possess the complexity and ambition of the Cazetiers. Very fine.",,RP 87
768,Louis Jadot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was reduced to a single barrel this year because of the frost. It has a light but well-defined, slightly minty bouquet that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, pleasing salinité here with good depth on the nutty finish. It feels long and tender. Maybe it would benefit from greater nerve on the last third but it should age well.",,RP 87
769,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru La Petite Chapelle (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru la Petite Chapelle has a floral, well-defined bouquet with perfumed red cherry and strawberry fruit, crushed rose petals and a touch of vanilla. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, quite cohesive and focused with a fine bead of acidity and a tensile, slightly tinny finish that will disappear by the time of bottling. This is worth investigating.",,RP 87
770,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots has a rather tight-knit and laconic bouquet that like other Suchots, seemed a bit fatigued by the vintage (although it was only slightly affected by frost). The palate is medium-bodied with an angular entry, quite linear and strict for a Suchots, with an orange peel and brown spice-infused finish. Fine, if just missing some opulence.",,RP 87
771,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes felt a little closed compared to the Beaux Monts, at least at this stage. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, good acidity, quite spicy in the mouth although I still find more complexity and purity within the Beaux Monts. This is more saturnine so give it five years in bottle to open up.",,RP 87
772,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Sentiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Sentiers has a light, quite conservative, tertiary bouquet with touches of cedar and tobacco. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, well-judged acidity and a low-key but pleasingly precise finish that blossoms with aeration. Very fine.",,RP 87
773,Louis Jadot,Corton Grèves Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Corton Grèves Grand Cru was showing quite a bit of oak on the nose but there was more than enough fruit packed behind it. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, a fine bead of acidity with a subtle marine influence surfacing toward the finish that just tapers in when I want it to fan out. But this is a pretty Corton Grèves in the making.",,RP 87
774,Louis Jadot,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru has a light bouquet with fragrant red cherry and strawberry fruit, nicely defined but I would be seeking more vigor, more gumption considering the vineyard. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, elegant and quite feminine, but like the nose it feels like it does not want to go that extra mile and deliver the amplitude you expect from a Bonnes-Mares. The 2015 was outstanding but this feels as if it is resigned to standing in its shadow.",,RP 87
775,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne had a very feisty bouquet, much more expressive than its peers, with scents of grilled walnut and smoke. It seems to calm down with aeration but it certainly has a lot of vigor. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, harmonious and with just a slightly honeyed texture. I appreciate the complexity on the finish here and this Clos de la Garenne shows more terroir expression that its peers from Jadot. Worth checking out.",,RP 87
776,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes has the best aromatics from the four Volnays I tasted from Jadot, principally because it has more opulence, more ""Volnay"" on the nose. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, ripe tannin, sweet and sensual with a lush, zest finish tinged with blue fruit and spice. Excellent.",,RP 87
777,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Ormes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Ormes has a fragrant, floral nose with blackberry, raspberry, cold wet limestone and light graphite aromas. The palate is fresh and tensile with supple tannin, impressive purity and a lightly peppered finish that lingers in the mouth. Very fine.",,RP 87
778,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru en Cailleret has a racy, chalky bouquet that seems to convey the terroir with more aplomb than other Chassagnes from Jadot. This is well defined and its place of origin really comes through. The palate is very well balanced with a fine line of acidity, hints of orange zest and quince complement the spice/ginger notes toward the finish. Excellent.",,RP 87
779,Louis Jadot,Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru has a brawny bouquet compared to the more refined Chapelle-Chambertin. This does not hold back with black fruit, dried blood and pressed flower aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly dry tannin, although I found the oak not singing from the same hymn sheet toward the finish, some wood tannins poking out. This feels like it needs more discipline.",,RP 87
780,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens has quite a meaty, dried blood-tinged bouquet that gives the aromatics personality. It gains clarity with time and offers attractive oyster shell aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-boned tannin, crisp acidity, nicely poised with a strict, quite liner, très Pommard finish that just needs to develop more complexity.",,RP 87
781,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Clos de la Commaraine (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Pommard 1er Cru Clos de la Commaraine has an attractive bouquet with scents of mulberry, blackcurrant, wild mint and a touch of orange zest. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, very focused and poised on the entry, quite linear and refusing to fan out on the finish. Yet I admire the tension here and the dash of black pepper on the finish that keeps the tongue a-tingling.",,RP 87
782,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières has a bit more gumption about it compared to the Porusot, delivering attractive smoked walnut and hazelnut aromas among the citrus fruit. The palate is concentrated on the entry with a more viscous texture than many Meursaults this vintage, lightly honeyed with a touch of mango and pineapple on the tropical-tinged finish. I like the spiciness that lingers on the aftertaste and it should drink well once in bottle.",,RP 87
783,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes will actually be ""domaine"" from the next vintage, so this is the last from purchased fruit. It has one of the more expressive aromatics from Jadot with plenty of walnut and smoke aromas blossoming in the glass. There is good vigor here. The palate is well balanced with quite a rich opening, then the acidity begins to bite in the middle and keeps this Meursault Charmes on its toes and does not let the concentration overpower on the finish. This may surpass the 2015 Charmes with two or three years in bottle.",,RP 87
784,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves has a very cohesive, perfumed and seductive bouquet with ample red cherry, crushed strawberry and raspberry scents, a touch of vanilla pod tucked in just behind. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, judicious acidity, lively with a linear, subtle sea-influenced finish. Very fine.",,RP 87
785,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru was 60% destroyed by frost and includes whole-bunch fruit, not least just to fill the small tank. You can feel those stems on the nose and maybe it just obscures the terroir expression. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, fine acidity but I felt there was some dryness and chewiness on the finish. I can’t help thinking that this Musigny cannot forget the trauma of the frost. Distracted? Let’s see how it turns out in bottle.",,RP 87
786,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux has a pure, quite lush bouquet with plenty of juicy red berry fruit laced with leather and tobacco. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, juicy tannin, not the most complex Beaune on the block but with admirable structure on the saline finish. Fine.",,RP 87
787,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Blagny (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Meursault Blagny has a clean and fresh nose of green apple, pear and light oyster shell aromas that are nicely defined The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, good tension here plus there is ample weight and concentration on the lightly honeyed, spicy finish. This is one of my favorite Meursaults from Louis Jadot in 2016.",,RP 87
788,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Aux Cras (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Aux Cras has a fragrant and floral bouquet with rose petal and peony scents infusing the red cherry and strawberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy mouthfeel, softer than the other premier cru Beaunes this vintage with an appealing, sorbet-fresh finish. Enjoy this Beaune premier cru in its youth after a couple of years.",,RP 87
789,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Blanc was impacted by the frost so that it was cropped at just 15 hectoliters per hectare, one-third that of Bressandes Blanc. It has a pretty lime and white peach-scented bouquet with a little more detail than the Bressandes Blanc. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, here a subtle marine influence coming to play toward the finish with a touch of oyster shell on the aftertaste. Fine.",,RP 87
790,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles felt a little smudged on the nose, quite honeyed with tropical tones, suggesting that it might have been picked a couple of days tardy (something I remarked upon apropos the 2015 last year). The palate actually shows more restraint and better tension than the nose augurs, the acidity well judged and demonstrating spicy, stem ginger notes toward the finish. Not bad, but it could have been better with an earlier picking.",,RP 87
791,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts, which comes under the domaine, not Maison Jadot, has quite a potent bouquet with scents of honeysuckle, jasmine, citrus fruit and apple blossom. I like the energy conveyed here—more than the La Garenne for example. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry, quite rich and slightly honeyed in texture with subtle spice and lemongrass notes surfacing on the very slightly oxidative finish.",,RP 87
792,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes has a straightforward, quite focused bouquet with light smoky, flinty scents gradually surfacing with time. The palate is well balanced with good depth, quite honeyed in texture with flecks of white chocolate and spice toward the finish. I would be seeking more tension and mineralité on this Combettes but let's see if that develops by the time of bottling.",,RP 87
793,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais-Villages (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Beaujolais-Villages is an appreciable step up over Jadot's regular Beaujolais, and it's a very attractive wine, opening in the glass with notes of ripe cherries, pomegranate, subtle licorice and dried herbs. Hearty in style, on the palate it's medium to full-bodied, with good concentration and depth at the core, framed by some youthfully chewy tannins and underpinned by succulent acids. For the exceedingly modest tariff it commands, this is really quite serious and I'd be inclined to give it another 6-12 months in the cellar before pulling corks.",,RP 87
794,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Beaujolais from Louis Jadot reveals aromas of sweet cherries and red berries, followed by a medium to full-bodied palate that's quite hearty and ample, with plenty of juicy fruit and a light framing of chewy tannins. This négociant bottling isn't going to make you forget the wines of Jadot's Château des Jacques, but it's a generous, fruit-driven Beaujolais that's widely available for a very modest tariff.",,RP 87
795,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Pinot Noir (Maison Louis Jadot),"A blend of fruit from the Côte d'Or and the Côte Chalonnaise, the 2015 Bourgogne Pinot Noir is a success, profiting from the vintage's balmy conditions. Offering up a sweet bouquet of jammy red cherries, plums and earthy spice, it's medium-bodied, ripe and rustic, with plenty of juicy fruit and chewy but fine-grained tannin.",,RP 87
796,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Jadot's 2015 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru is stunningly good in the 2015 vintage, bursting from the glass with a primary bouquet of candied red cherry, plum, rose petal, coniferous forest floor and a hint of the black truffle to come, judiciously framed by new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and deep, with wonderful concentration and depth, its generous core of ripe fruit underpinned by bright, racy acids. This still need time to come together—15 years, ideally—but its potential is immense.",,RP 87
797,Louis Jadot,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru from Louis Jadot is one of the most firmly shut down wines in the portfolio, but its potential is superb, unfurling in the glass with notes of wild berries, creamy cherry, rose hip and currant leaf. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with outstanding purity and energy, but dominated for the time being by its ample chassis of chalky, fine-grained tannins which will take a decade or more to melt away. The rewards of patience will be considerable.",,RP 87
798,Louis Jadot,Echézeaux Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Jadot's 2015 Echézeaux Grand Cru is showing brilliantly from bottle, offering up a youthfully reserved but beautifully pure nose of raspberry, black cherry, rose petal, violet, subtle incense and a nicely integrated framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is ample, full-bodied and succulent, with bright acids and a superb sense of control despite its scale, its tannins fine-grained but formidable. To reiterate, this is firmly shut down at present, and while its potential is considerable it is likely to remain that way for a good decade.",,RP 87
799,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules from Louis Jadot is absolutely superb, wafting from the glass with a youthful but incipiently complex nose of ripe cherry, plum, dried rose petal and subtle forest floor. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and gourmand, with a lavishly textural attack, velvety tannins and a deep core of succulent fruit. This is one of the high points of an exceptional vintage for the Beaune hillside.",,RP 87
800,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc from Louis Jadot is superb, wafting from the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of yellow orchard fruit, Mirabelle plum, hazelnut and white flowers. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, with a generously textural attack, succulent acids, chewy concentration, and excellent length on the penetrating and lengthy finish. While this will be approachable in its youth, it has the structure and substance to age.",,RP 87
801,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Fuées (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Jadot's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Fuées is very pretty, opening in the glass with notes of sweet red fruit—a mélange of strawberries, plums, cherry and raspberry—cocoa nib and peony. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, fine-grained and expansive, with chalky tannins, bright acids and a deep core of fruit, its detail and delicacy marrying to great effect with the inherent richness and authority of the vintage.",,RP (88-90)
802,Louis Jadot,Echézeaux Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Echézeaux Grand Cru, which unlike the Clos Vougeot was severely hit by the frost, was missing some fruité on the nose, stubborn and rather withdrawn. The palate is medium-bodied with broad tannin, good acidity but there is sense that the frost denuded this grand cru of its nobility, thus the finish feels rather smudged and monotone. I found this disappointing because of what happened in the vineyard rather than any winemaking fault.",,RP (88-90)
803,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Grande Montagne (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Grande Montagne has a well-defined bouquet with citrus peel, cooking apple and a touch of brioche. The palate is well balanced with a fresh line of acidity, a pleasant oyster shell note coming through here with just some bitterness on the abrupt finish.",,RP (88-90)
804,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazeys (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazey has an expressive crushed strawberry and raspberry bouquet that really explodes from the glass. Where did that come from? The palate is balanced with fleshy red fruit, a little oaky toward the second half but there is plenty of body here and decent length.",,RP (88-90)
805,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Savigny les Beaune 1Er Cru Clos des Guettes is the only white produced by Jadot this year, just six barrels from 1.5-hectares of vines. It has a clean, well-defined bouquet with light honeysuckle tones complementing the green apple and pear aromas. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, cohesive in the mouth and well defined with appreciable tension on the red apple and tangerine-tinged finish. This is a well-made, promising Savigny Blanc.",,RP (88-90)
806,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos des Gatsulards Monopole (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Santenay Clos des Gatsulards, which comes under the Domaine Gagey label, offers attractive blackcurrant and raspberry scents that are neatly combined with the oak. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, well-judged acidity and plenty of crunchy black fruit laced with graphite on the finish. Worth looking out for.",,RP (88-90)
807,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée was more closed compared to the en Cailleret at this stage, without the same degree of delineation and terroir expression. The palate is balanced with a fat and slightly honeyed opening, touches of almond and nutmeg infusing the light tropical tones, but it lacks tension and energy on the finish. The 2015 showed better last year.",,RP (88-90)
808,Louis Jadot,Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey),The 2016 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes was reduced to just six barrels because of the frost. It still has a decent blackcurrant and cranberry leaf-scented bouquet with attractive undergrowth scents percolating through. The palate is well balanced with supple tannin. This feels lithe and harmonious with strawberry pastilles and a touch of spice toward the finish. Fine.,,RP (88-90)
809,Louis Jadot,Fixin Clos Moreau Monopole (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Fixin Clos Moreau was cloudy in the glass and the aromatics too primal to read at the moment. The palate is simple but balanced, a fine bead of acidity here, straightforward citrus fruit that segues into a more tropical, rounded finish that bodes well for the future. One to watch.",,RP (88-90)
810,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Combottes (Maison Louis Jadot),The 2016 Pernand Vergelesses Combottes is two-thirds of the normal crop (better than the Croix de Pierre). This sample sported a pleasant reduction on the nose with sufficient fruit tucked behind. The palate is ripe and rounded on the entry. This is quite rich and lightly honeyed in texture though perhaps at the expense of some detail and tension on the finish. But it will offer four or five years of drinking pleasure.,,RP (88-90)
811,Louis Jadot,Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot has a more complex and involved bouquet than the Les Sous Roches: dusky black fruit, black pepper and leather surface in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin but good depth of dark berry fruit. It feels a little hard toward the finish whereby the wood tannins budge their way in, but it should gain more harmony by the time of bottling.",,RP (88-90)
812,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes probably did not quite deliver the precision and detail of its stablemates, Les Grèves and Les Theurons, although there is plenty of earthy black fruit in situ. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy opening and good body but like the nose, it is missing some detail on the stocky, broad-shouldered finish.",,RP (88-90)
813,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode has a superb bouquet with lively red cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, a touch of orange blossom and blood orange developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with crunchy red berry fruit, a little foursquare and conservative compared to the aromatics, with a short, quite structured, masculine finish. Give this a couple of years once bottled.",,RP (88-90)
814,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Baudines (Maison Louis Jadot),The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Baudines was missing some tension and detail on the nose and felt a little static compared to the Embrazées. The palate is better with a tang of orange peel on the entry and good weight but I find it is missing some complexity and terroir expression on the finish.,,RP (88-90)
815,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis Village has a fine, sturdy bouquet with dark berry fruit laced with leather and tertiary scents. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, lively and tensile with a slightly tart finish. Very fine—better than the 2015 in fact.",,RP (88-90)
816,Louis Jadot,Rully Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Rully Village, due to be bottled at the end of the year, has a light bouquet with green apple and citrus notes, perhaps just a little anonymous compared to its peers. The palate is clean and well balanced, demonstrating more personality here with fresh orange zest and blackcurrant notes on the pert finish.",,RP (88-90)
817,Louis Jadot,Chorey-lès-Beaune Beaumonts (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Chorey les Beaune Beaumonts has a fragrant, vanillary bouquet with scents of Morello cherry and strawberry. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy black fruit laced with tobacco, some wood tannins toward the finish but it retains decent focus.",,RP (88-90)
818,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Blanc (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Marsannay Blanc was reduced to two barrels this year because of the frost. It has a simple, primal bouquet that needs to show a little more complexity. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry with light tropical tones (pineapple and guava) that lead to a brisk, slightly short finish. The palate offers more than the aromatics at the moment but it should drink well for three or four years after bottling.",,RP (88-90)
819,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet Villages has a simple, light but attractive bouquet with limestone and green apple scents wafting from the glass. The palate is balanced with quite a rich and generous opening, more fatness here than I was expecting from a village cru, but with a decent white chocolate-tinged finish. Fine.",,RP (88-90)
820,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Les Longeroies (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Marsannay les Longeroies has a fragrant, floral bouquet with ample black cherry and raspberry scents, a hint of cassis in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly hard tannins on the entry, grippy black fruit and a slightly attenuated finish.",,RP (88-90)
821,Louis Jadot,Aloxe-Corton Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Aloxe-Corton Villages has a simple, slightly rustic bouquet that needs a little more delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with finer tannins than I expected after the nose, with clean red berry fruit laced with tobacco, though the finish is simple and knows its place.",,RP (88-90)
822,Louis Jadot,Auxey-Duresses Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Auxey Duresses Village Blanc has a light, slightly subdued bouquet with resinous scents filtering through the citrus fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp citrus fruit, peach and mandarin, though it pulls up short on the finish at the moment.",,RP (88-90)
823,Louis Jadot,Ladoix Le Clou d'Orge (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Ladoix le Clou d'Orge has a clear, straightforward bouquet with some creaminess originating from the new oak. The palate is wet and forward on the entry with rounded texture, tropical tones from the beginning with a luscious finish that will have commercial appeal.",,RP (88-90)
824,Louis Jadot,Givry Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Givry Village offers a light nuttiness and smokiness on the nose, almost Meursault-like in character. The palate is lively on the entry with a fine bead of acidity. This sample just missed a little detail on the finish but there is decent weight even if it does not quite have the complexity of the 2015.",,RP (88-90)
825,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"My sample of 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet Villages was assembled from just the village crus, although due to depleted quantities it may include some premier crus by the time of bottling. Still, it has a pleasing vigor and tension on the nose even if it is uncomplicated. The palate is balanced and clean, but it needs a little more personality and tension toward the finish. It feels just a touch static at the moment so let's see how it shows once in bottle.",,RP (88-90)
826,Louis Jadot,Saint-Romain (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Saint Romain Village has a simple bouquet that was missing some delineation. The palate is primal with good weight in the mouth, although it lacks the complexity of the 2015 Saint-Romain. Drink over the next couple of years.",,RP (88-90)
827,Louis Jadot,Volnay Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Volnay Village was dominated by the wood at first, although they did seem to ebb away with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin that rather crowds out the fruit. I didn't quite get this wine...",,RP (88-90)
828,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Couvent des Jacobins (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Bourgogne Couvent des Jacobins, which was already in bottle, has a simple, light honeysuckle-scented bouquet. The palate is primal with grapefruit and a touch of sour lemon, not long but at least clean. Drink over the next 18 months or so.",,RP (88-90)
829,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Saint Aubin Village was missing some vigor on the nose compared to its peers. The palate is clean and fresh, quite primal in the mouth with a short, uncomplicated finish. Hopefully this will improve by the time of bottling.",,RP (88-90)
830,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Poissenots (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Poissenots has a very opulent, slightly over-egged bouquet compared to the more refined Petits Chapelle. The palate is sweet and candied on the entry, quite concentrated but I feel the wood tannin dominates the finish and endangers drying it out with bottle age. Let's see how this develops.",,RP (88-90)
831,Louis Jadot,Saint Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers Dents de Chien (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Murgers Dents de Chien was showing quite a lot of reduction on the nose, making it difficult to read. The palate is rounded in the mouth, very reduced at the moment and so I will defer judgement until later.",,RP (88-90)
832,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Chapelle Chambertin Grand Cru from Louis Jadot (Domaine Gagey) has a very subtle and refined bouquet with pure red berry fruit, minerals, rose petals and orange blossom—one of the most entrancing aromatics of the vintage. The palate is very well balanced with a slightly tart entry, driven along by the acidity but with sufficient fruit tucked in just below. It fans out gloriously on the finish and leaves you wanting more. Quite simply, this is one of the finest wines from this grand cru vineyard. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (88-90)
833,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Chevalier Montrachet les Demoiselles Grand Cru from Louis Jadot (Domaine Gagey) was much more closed on the nose compared to its peers. Cornice pear, green apple and a scent of wet pavement just after it has rained manifest with aeration, however it needs more cohesion and vigor. The palate is very well balanced with fine delineation, clean and precise with a fine bead of acidity. There is a patina of vanilla-laced new oak toward the finish that needs to be addressed. There is a chance that this will improve in bottle and reach the level I found out of barrel. There will be a lot of pleasure finding out.",,RP (88-90)
834,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, Jadot's 2014 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques has perhaps the most elegant bouquet of the quintet, perhaps the best translation of terroir with exquisitely defined red cherry and strawberry fruit suffused with minerals. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, very supple, almost nubile in the mouth, leading to a concentrated finish that lingers long and tenderly. It does not quite deliver the sophistication of Bruno Clair's Clos Saint-Jacques, but with sufficient bottle age it should show its pedigree. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (88-90)
835,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Jadot's 2014 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru has a light brioche-scented nose that lacks some complexity at first, but aeration sees more mineralité developing. The palate improves in the glass eventually; after ten minutes, it demonstrates fine weight in the mouth. It boasts a slightly honeyed texture with a touch of nutmeg on the finish. Very fine.",,RP (88-90)
836,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières (Héritiers de Louis Jadot Bottling), which was bottled under Diam 30, felt overripe on the nose and much more tropical than its peers: passion fruit, a touch of guava and vanilla. The palate is rounded on the entry with hints of marmalade, tangy and generous in the mouth. What it lacks in mineralité, it compensates for in sheer weight and concentration, which is a bit of a let down after its scintillating performance out of barrel.",,RP (88-90)
837,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru from Domaine Louis Jadot offers lively red cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper notes on the nose, quite intense and thankfully retaining satisfying delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, firm grip in the mouth and a tightly wound, slightly brutish finish that needs bottle age to gain more elegance. I just hope there is sufficient fruit to see it through. Like a handful of other Clos de Vougeot, in bottle this does not match up to the performance out of barrel. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (88-90)
838,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne from Louis Jadot (Domaine du Duc de Magenta) has a very ripe, tropical-tinged bouquet that lacks both definition and mineralité. The palate is medium-bodied with a saline entry and good weight in the mouth, but I just feel this was picked a couple of days too late? It is certainly not a poor wine; however, I was expecting more Puligny in my Puligny. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (88-90)
839,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, Louis Jadot's 2014 Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers) has an attractive bouquet with lifted raspberry preserves and wild strawberry scents, a touch of rose petal emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with tart red cherries and strawberry, quite saline in the mouth; however, it cuts away very quickly on the finish. It is the kind of Corton you want to give a kick up the backside because it just needs to aim higher. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (88-90)
840,Louis Jadot,Mâcon-Villages (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Macon Villages, matured in stainless steel, has a bright, joyful bouquet with fresh citrus fruit tinged with lime. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity and while not complex, it is showing fine energy with a persistent finish. For a Mâcon-Villages, this will do fine.",,RP (88-90)
841,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Vaudésir (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru Vaudésir has a well-defined and quite complex bouquet, with scents of yellow plum, jasmine, flint and a touch of spice. The palate is well defined with a viscous opening, quite tropical in style but redeemed by a lovely thread of acidity and compelling purity on the finish. This is far superior to many Vaudésir that I tasted, demonstrating persistency and class from start to finish. Congratulations to Frédéric Barnier and his team! This is really rather excellent.",,RP (88-90)
842,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses is matured in exactly the same way as the premier crus. It has a sophisticated and intense bouquet of mineral-driven citrus fruit, granite and slate, with just a cheeky dab of spice. The palate is well balanced with a harmonious opening. The acidity is very well judged and the oak complements the layers of spicy fruit that fan out with confidence on the finish. This is a well-made, powerful les Preuses that should age with style.",,RP (88-90)
843,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Chalumaux (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Chalumaux has an austere but well-defined bouquet with scents of smoke and flint. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, not a terribly complex premier cru Puligny though I appreciate the marine influence that comes through on the finish. Drink over the next five to seven years.",,RP (88-90)
844,Louis Jadot,Meursault Narvaux (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The debut 2016 Meursault Narvaux is a step up from the village cru with peach and light apricot scents emerging from the glass. The palate is well balanced with a pleasant sappiness on the entry. It is missing a little tension like many white Burgundies this vintage, although there is pleasing spiciness that surfaces right at the end.",,RP (88-90)
845,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Blanchards (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Blanchards has a generous bouquet with plenty of tobacco-tinged fruit, although it does not quite have the clarity of the Clos des Ormes. The palate is medium-bodied with crunchy red berry fruit, plenty of graphite with a slightly bitter finish that needs more finesse.",,RP (88-90)
846,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Clos de la Barre Monopole (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Clos de la Barre had a very slight reduction on the nose, slightly meaty but there is plenty of fruit here. Maybe there is just a faint touch of brettanomyces? The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grain tannin, good depth and body here although like the Santenots, I would be seeking more detail and terroir expression on the finish.",,RP (88-90)
847,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Santenots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots has an appealing, mint-fresh bouquet with ample dark plum and blackcurrant scents that gain vigor in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, quite supple tannin and satisfying depth, although I would be seeking more complexity on the finish given the vineyard.",,RP (88-90)
848,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Porusot has quite an elegant, understated bouquet that seems to gain intensity in the glass, revealing light brioche and nutty scents with time. The palate is well balanced with a touch of orange rind and sour lemon on the entry, moderate weight with a slightly curtailed finish. It just needs to gain a little length by the end of its élevage.",,RP (88-90)
849,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vaucrains (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Vaucrains felt a little raw on the nose, rather stemmy compared to the Boudots. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, grippy in the mouth but it feels rather bony and needs more flesh toward the finish.",,RP (88-90)
850,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée Village has a clean and pure black cherry and violet-scented bouquet that could not come from anywhere but this village. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, ripe tannin, slightly grainy black fruit and an ample, rounded finish. One of the best village crus from Jadot this year.",,RP (88-90)
851,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes, which comes under the Domaine Gagey label, has a vibrant and fresh, rose petal-scented bouquet with plenty of Morello cherry and crushed strawberry scents. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grain tannin, good tension even if it is just missing some complexity toward the finish, as if running out of ideas two-thirds of the way through.",,RP (88-90)
852,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Musigny Grand Cru has a very detailed, complex bouquet with ""cool"" dark berry fruit intermingling with damp moss, iodine and crushed violet aromas. There is a purring engine underneath the bonnet of this Musigny. The palate is medium-bodied with endearing balance, a really stylish and assured Musigny with gratifying precision and complexity towards the finish that fans out gloriously. And yet there is much more hidden away here, to wit, a Musigny that deserves several years in bottle. This has huge potential.",,RP 91
853,Louis Jadot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru, which lies adjacent to Philippe Charlopin's (in fact, both were bought at the same time), has a very impressive dark berry, sous-bois, incense and iris-scented bouquet that is beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine balance and structure. There are layers of dark berry fruit here laced with chalk and a dash of black pepper, but what really elevates this is the precision and focus on the finish - one of the best amongst Louis Jadot's wines. This is an outstanding Clos Saint-Denis that will give 20-30 years of pleasure.",,RP 91
854,Louis Jadot,Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru has a more complex, you could say more enigmatic bouquet than the Charmes-Chambertin, darker fruit with touches of seaweed and iodine, with aeration more floral scents such as crushed violet. It feels mercurial in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, a touch of dried fig and Asian spice infusing the red berry fruit. What I appreciate is the structure and especially the precision towards the finish. This is classy.",,RP 91
855,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chambertin Grand Cru has a composed and harmonious, assured bouquet with mineral-driven red berry fruit, a touch of undergrowth and chalk emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, quite firm tannin. This is a conservative, correct Chambertin with superb structure, real density and assertiveness towards the finish. Will it develop the personality of the Mazis-Chambertin? Still, this represents an impressive Chambertin from Jadot that will give 20-30 years of pleasure.",,RP 91
856,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru has an open red cherry, crushed strawberry and sea spray-scented bouquet that perhaps does not quite have the complexity, nor the intrigue of the Mazis-Chambertin at this stage. The palate is refined with grippy tannin and a commendable sense of energy and tension. The salinity comes through on the finish and lends this grand cru fine sappiness, urging you back for another sip. For those with patience...",,RP 91
857,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques has a lively, vivacious bouquet with vibrant red cherries, redcurrant and orange rind scents that remain very controlled yet at the same time, very detailed. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, elegant in style, silky smooth in texture leading to a detailed, mineral-driven and harmonious finish that has grace and panache. This is superb.",,RP 91
858,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes (Maison Louis Jadot),"They 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes has an intriguing bouquet, perhaps the most complex and saturnine of the premier crus from this appellation, ferrous-tinged red berry fruit, black pepper and hints of brown spice emerging with time. The palate is very well balanced with a fine line of acidity, wonderful structure and poise, with superb tension and energy towards the satin-textured finish. This comes highly recommended - a top-notch premier cru with sophistication.",,RP 91
859,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Corton Pougets Grand Cru, under the Domaine des Héritiers Jadot label, has a crisp, quite pure bouquet with the fruit a little darker than the Corton Grèves at the moment but equally well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, moderate depth, rounded in the mouth with layers of cranberry and strawberry fruit. There is a pinch of sea salt right on the finish that shows fine precision and focus. This is outstanding.",,RP 91
860,Louis Jadot,Corton Grèves Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Corton Grèves Grand Cru was demonstrating some reduction on the nose, though underneath lie some decent black fruit that should offer good vigor once in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet supple tannin, well-judged acidity, harmonious in the mouth with a gentle but insistent grip on the silky smooth finish. Once the aromatics gain their cohesion and clarity, which they will, this will be a very fine Corton Grèves.",,RP 91
861,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts was shaded by the Les Suchots in this occasion, more foursquare and less terroir-driven at the moment, though developing attractive woodland and sous-bois aromas with time in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe black cherry and boysenberry fruit, a fine bead of acidity and commendable precision on the finish. This has potential, but it may need more bottle age than the Les Suchots.",,RP 91
862,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Clos de la Barre (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Clos de la Barre has a more detailed and focused bouquet than the Santenots and en l'Ormeau, subtle sous-bois scents infusing the detailed red berry fruit mixed with cranberry and wild hedgerow. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with tart red cherries and raspberry, well structured and very focused. This shows the most class within the five Volnay 2015s that I tasted from Maison Louis Jadot. This is excellent.",,RP 91
863,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots has a distinct marine influence on the nose, shucked oyster shells and iodine complementing the red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, gentle but insistent grip, very good depth with the exuberance and precocity you expect from this vineyard. It should age with panache for 15-20 years.",,RP 91
864,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Epenots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pommard 1er Cru Epenots has a spicy, quite complex bouquet of red cherries, black plum, kirsch and hints of brown spice, quite involving and certainly a level up from the Grands Epenots. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, crisp and crunchy in the mouth with very fine Pommard expression towards the structured, masculine finish. This is a superb Pommard from Louis Jadot that should give 15-20 years of drinking pleasure, possibly more.",,RP 91
865,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru has a potent nose with dried honey and blackberry leaf, orange blossom and cold stone developing in the glass. The palate is very well balanced with crisp acidity, viscous, almost waxy in texture with decent weight on the finish, although this year I find that the Chevalier-Montrachet is in possession of more personality and race.",,RP 91
866,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles cocked a snook at the Les Saint Georges: much more generous and terroir-driven by comparison with wet limestone scents, rose petals and orange zest infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, nicely focused and full of energy, almost Vosne Les Suchots in style towards what feels like a precocious yet balanced finish. This would be my pick of the NSG's from Louis Jadot this vintage.",,RP 91
867,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses has a detailed bouquet, complex as you would expect from such a propitious vineyard, touches of chalk and granite infusing the red and black fruit, beautifully focused and gaining intensity all the time in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, tensile and focused, full of energy with a structured, more masculine finish than I was anticipating. Therefore, it will need several years in bottle but should turn out to be a long-term contender. Expect it to land at the top of my banded score post-bottling.",,RP 91
868,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques was showing a bit of reduction on the nose when I tasted the barrel sample. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, well-judged acidity, a slight candied orange peel note towards the finish that fans out with confidence. This is an excellent premier cru like the Lavaux Saint-Jacques, although it should be afforded 4-6 years in bottle.",,RP 91
869,Louis Jadot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has a voluminous and extravagant bouquet with blooms of red berry fruit, although I found myself more drawn to the complex and intellectual Clos Saint-Denis. The palate is medium-bodied with grippy tannin. This is a masculine, assertive Clos de la Roche, quite saline in the mouth with a feisty, spicy finish. This is a fine grand cru from Louis Jadot, though not one of their top releases this vintage.",,RP 91
870,Louis Jadot,Corton Maréchaudes Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Corton Maréchaudes Grand Cru has a gentle and quite sensual bouquet with lifted raspberry coulis, cranberry and hints of cola developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, a fine line of acidity, crisp in the mouth with a silky smooth finish that renders this almost drinkable at this prenatal stage. I like the piquancy here and it is bestowed with fine length in the mouth.",,RP 91
871,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières, under the ""Domaine Héritiers du Jadot"" label, was more reserved than the Puligny Clos de la Garenne when I tasted them side by side, but it opens with attractive limestone and granitic aromas. The palate is crisp on the entry with vibrant acidity, well balanced with orange zest and a touch of tangy marmalade lending complexity on the taut and focused finish. Excellent - this is one of Jadot's best whites this vintage.",,RP 91
872,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vaucrains (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Vaucrains has much more personality and charm than the NSG Les Boudots, with copious red cherry and kirsch scents, hints of blood orange developing with time in the glass. The palate is well balanced with supple tart red cherry fruit, a pleasant piquancy here with a focused, quite tensile finish that just needs to develop a little more length. Nonetheless, this is a classy Nuits Saint-Georges.",,RP 91
873,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Boucherottes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Les Boucherottes has a subtle bouquet that comes across more introspective than the 2015 Beaune Clos des Couchereaux, the fruit darker but equally well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, tensile tannin - plenty of tart red cherry fruit, quite saline in the mouth leading to an understated but very focused finish. This is another top-notch Beaune Premier Cru from Louis Jadot.",,RP 91
874,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Feusselottes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Feusselottes has a winsome bouquet with copious red cherries, cranberry and bergamot scents that unfurl in the glass. There is a fine marine-like, seaweed scent that evolves. The palate is fresh on the entry with good grip. This is a solid and dense Chambolle-Musigny, nicely structured with broody dark berry fruit laced with black tea and spice towards the finish. It will require 4-5 years in bottle before it really enters its stride.",,RP 91
875,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru has an expressive nose with red cherry, cranberry and strawberry fruit, a feminine bouquet with neatly integrated new oak. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, quite tensile in the mouth with a slightly pinched, compact finish that should broaden out once it has completed its élevage. This is a respectable grand cru, even if I would not hold it up as one of Jadot's top-tier 2015s.",,RP 91
876,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret offers the most attractive aromatics of the septet of Pulignys that I tasted from Louis Jadot - white flowers, patisserie, minerals, all very nuanced but gaining vigor in the glass. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, a touch of viscosity with commendable tension on the finish. This should be delicious over the next decade or so and represents an outstanding effort in a growing season that did not favor the white Burgundy wines.",,RP 91
877,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes offers a composed bouquet, understated at first but soon opening with red and black cherries, woodland and cold limestone aromas that are nicely detailed. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with plenty of candied red berry fruit. Indeed, there is a ""sweet shop"" tincture to this Chambolle-Musigny that I like, with plenty of sucrosity on the finish that does not impede upon terroir expression or delineation. Excellent.",,RP 91
878,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens has an intense, powerful bouquet with layers of ripe wild strawberry, raspberry and cranberry; there is great volume and drive here with floral scents (iris and rose petal) emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe red cherry fruit, a little rustic compared to the Pommard Epenots, broad-shouldered with firm and insistent grip. But I kind of like the ""unruliness"" of this Rugiens and it stands it in good stead for several years bottle age. This is a great Pommard from winemaker Frederic Barnier and his team.",,RP 91
879,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux is a little charmer on the nose with wild strawberry, briary and blackcurrant scents entwined with fine mineralité and tension. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, a gentle grip, neatly integrated oak and very fine detail on the finish. What a delicious and expressive Beaune from Louis Jadot.",,RP 91
880,Louis Jadot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a clean and pure bouquet with red apples and citrus lemon, later tinned peach and summer fruit developing with commensurate mineralité. The palate is well balanced with fresh citrus fruit, well-integrated oak, good weight and though not long, it is focused with a lovely praline and fresh ginger note lingering on the aftertaste. Just a delicious, not profound, but very worthwhile white Burgundy in the making.",,RP 91
881,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Embazées (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Embazées has a gorgeous yellow plum, Mirabelle and mango-scented bouquet that seems very pure and very intense. The palate is well balanced with a crisp entry, fine energy here with grilled walnut on the fumé-tinged finish. This sashays along with some style and should be worth seeking out once in bottle.",,RP 91
882,Louis Jadot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru has a rounded, generous bouquet with scents of red cherries, kirsch and incense. The palate is sweet and precocious on the entry with brown spices infusing the red cherry fruit, although I found the new oak a little conspicuous towards the finish. I would look for more refinement once this grand cru is in bottle.",,RP 91
883,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (from the domaine side of Jadot) has a brioche-scented, slightly creamy bouquet, the oak more conspicuous than its Chassagne cousins at the moment. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, fresh and lively with quite a composed and tensile finish that feels harmonious and assured. One to watch.",,RP 91
884,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée has a lightly honeyed bouquet with scents dried apricot and dried pineapple emerging with a few swirls of the glass. The palate is well-balanced, the oak enmeshed within the citrus fruit, touch of hazelnut and spice surfacing towards the finish and lending it a Meursault-like personality. There is clearly respectable complexity here and this represents one of Maison Louis Jadot's better 2015 Chassagnes.",,RP 91
885,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Grands Epenots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pommard 1er Cru Grands Epenots offers appealing raspberry, cranberry and redcurrant scents on the nose, initially muted but quickly gaining vigor in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, orange rind and a touch of brown spice, gently fanning out towards the finish but never fully letting go. It does feel a little ""rigid"" at the moment, but it should mellow with 4-5 years in bottle.",,RP 91
886,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Aux Cras (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Aux Cras, under the Domaine Gagey label, has a soft, mellow and quite seductive bouquet with raspberry, crushed strawberry and hints of blood orange. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy tannin, good weight in the mouth with quite a dense, almost ""solid"" finish that needs to muster more finesse as it ages. I am sure it will, a wine of substance at present, it should mature into a very capable Beaune Aux Cras.",,RP 91
887,Louis Jadot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is much more reserved on the nose than the 2015 Bienvenues - austere, stony and stoic, gaining intensity after 5-10 minutes in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a crisp line of acidity, a slight bitterness on the back palate but it fans out nicely to a spicy finish, even if it does not quite have the panache of the Bienvenues at the moment.",,RP 91
888,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes has an understated bouquet with blackberry, raspberry and cold stone aromas, more introspective than the Clos de la Barre, yet detailed. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red cherry and strawberry fruit, quite forward and generous; here, the new oak showing just a little obviously towards the finish (there is one new barrel and one used - my staple was actually from the one-year-old barrel). I am sure that will enmesh with 3-4 years requisite bottle age.",,RP 91
889,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes has a satisfying density and cohesion on the nose, a mixture of red and black fruit with just a slight reductive tinniness that will go before bottling. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin. This Bressandes has plenty of rondeur, a fine line of acidity with a slightly broody finish that should open up (eventually). This is a very capable Bressandes.",,RP 91
890,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves was showing a little more detail on the nose compared to the Bressandes, a touch of more terroir expression. The palate is very fresh on the entry with fine tannin, brisk and breezy with a fine, insistent grip towards the finish. This just seems to ""flor"" across the mouth and the precision on the finish deserves applause. Excellent...but not the best Beaune premier cru from Jadot this year it seems.",,RP 91
891,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers has a detailed and expressive bouquet with a convincing sous-bois infused bouquet that gains intensity in the glass, plenty of detailed red berry fruit blossoming with aeration. The palate is detailed and precise with crisp acidity, maybe compact at the moment, yet the delineation on the finish is very commendable. I hope by bottling there is just a little more persistence on the aftertaste.",,RP 91
892,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Petite Chapelle (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Petite Chapelle has an attractive wild strawberry and raspberry-scented bouquet with some lovely rose petal scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, a fine sense of salinity and a very detailed finish. Not the best known premier cru in Gevrey, yet this is a very commendable expression of the vineyard by the Jadot team.",,RP 91
893,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot has a bit of an obvious reduction on the nose, but it works well and there is fine mineralité tucked underneath that will flourish with bottle age. The palate is very well balanced, quite lush in the mouth, with subtle tropical tones that become more obvious toward the peachy, passion fruit finish. It might lack tension and terroir and is a furlong behind the Les Preuses and Vaudésir, but it is undeniably delicious.",,RP 91
894,Louis Jadot,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre was matured in 50% stainless steel and 50% oak barrels for 15 months. It has an attractive bouquet, with scents of apricot blossom, lemon thyme and struck flint, that is detailed and gains intensity in the glass. The palate is well balanced, with a viscous opening—a smear of honey over citrus fruit-tinged with mango—though it retains decent delineation and poise on the finish. This works much better than the Fourchaume.",,RP 91
895,Louis Jadot,Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis 1Er Cru Fourchaume is matured 50% in stainless steel and 50% in oak barrels with 15 months on the lees. Tasted blind, incidentally, I felt that it was showing too much oak on the nose and this occluded the terroir expression, that sense of Chablis austerity that marks its best wines. The palate is rich and quite honeyed, slightly buttery in style. It's a Chardonnay that has plenty of flavor; however, it's not one you would pin down as a Chablis. Commercial in an unabashed way, it is an extravagant, delicious Chardonnay rather than a great Chablis.",,RP 91
896,Louis Jadot,Pouilly-Fuissé (Maison Louis Jadot),The 2015 Pouilly Fuisse feels a little stilted on the nose and does not quite engage as much as its peers. The palate is better with crisp acidity and attractive orange rind and spice notes but it seems to attenuate on the finish and leave you feeling a bit shortchanged.,,RP 91
897,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais-Villages Combe Aux Jacques (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Beaujolais Villages Combe Aux Jacques has a straightforward, slightly reduced bouquet with red plum and blueberry scents. The palate is again quite simple and perhaps could have benefited from more delineation, although there is plenty of fruit packed in here and it seems clean on the finish. Adequate rather than exceptional.",,RP 91
898,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots (Domaine Gagey),"Tasted blind at Flint Wines’ 2007/2012 Nuits Saint-Georges tasting in London. The 2012 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots from Domaine Gagey did not live up to its showing from barrel. This bottle had a slightly funky nose that feels disjointed compared to others, a faint scent of nail varnish behind the kirsch and cassis fruit. The palate is ripe and sweet. This feels over-extracted and lacks detail on the finish. This was a vexing showing of a normally good wine, hence the question mark against my score. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 91
899,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Saint Georges (Maison Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at Flint Wines’ 2007/2012 Nuits Saint-Georges tasting in London. The 2012 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Saint-Georges from Louis Jadot demonstrated some volatile acidity on the nose that detracted from the detail and freshness. The palate is sweet and over-extracted, a touch acetic here with a rather cloying finish. I remember this showing well out of barrel, but this bottle just seemed rather out of sorts. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 91
900,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 1999 Montrachet Grand Cru from Louis Jadot was drinking extremely well. Mint and fennel on the nose, touches of almond and grilled walnut following through later, there is a hell of a lot going on here. The palate is well balanced with impressive depth, developing a waxy texture in the mouth with Conference pear and cooking apple towards the weighty, quite penetrating finish. This is an excellent Montrachet from Jadot, even if it does not possess the killer tension of the very top white Burgundies. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 91
901,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 1971 Corton Pougets Grand Cru was actually served from an impressive double magnum by Pierre-Henri Gagey himself. It was clear in color, the bouquet perfumed with a hint of patisserie infusing the generous red fruit, later offering more wilted rose petal scents before finally losing energy. The palate is medium-bodied with quite robust tannin although there is satisfying freshness irrespective of its age. I tempered my score because there was some hardness on the finish although even that seemed to be addressed as it opened and improved in the glass, finding evermore harmony (probably a result of this being poured from a larger format). Very fine. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 91
902,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Musigny Grand Cru has a very detailed, complex bouquet with ""cool"" dark berry fruit intermingling with damp moss, iodine and crushed violet aromas. There is a purring engine underneath the bonnet of this Musigny. The palate is medium-bodied with endearing balance, a really stylish and assured Musigny with gratifying precision and complexity towards the finish that fans out gloriously. And yet there is much more hidden away here, to wit, a Musigny that deserves several years in bottle. This has huge potential.",,RP 91
903,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes has an attractive nose: citrus fruit, yellow plum and a touch of egg whites all nicely defined. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, quite spicy and lively, although the finish seems to close the show early and clams up. Give it 3-5 years once in bottle and it should stretch its wings.",,RP (90-92)
904,Louis Jadot,Meursault Gouttes d'Or (Maison Louis Jadot),"There is only one barrel of the 2015 Meursault Gouttes d'Or this year. It has a composed bouquet with scents of grilled almond and hazelnut, smoke emerging in the background. The palate is very well balanced with a slightly viscous opening, plenty of lemongrass and ginger notes with tangy marmalade towards the finish. There is quite a lot going on here and it may improve by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
905,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Narbantons (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Narbantons has a very appealing, pure bouquet with ripe redcurrant and cranberry fruit, demonstrating more cohesion and vigor than the Santenays by comparison. The palate is very rounded on the entry with smooth tannin, well-judged acidity, not exceptionally complex but with a caressing nature on the slightly piquant finish. A very capable Savigny.",,RP (90-92)
906,Louis Jadot,Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot has a lovely, quite beguiling bouquet just like the Sous Roches village cru: ample red cherries, crushed strawberry with a touch of mineralité coming through with aeration (cold limestone). The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, lively with slightly darker fruit than the Monthélie Sous Roches, endowed with fine structure and vigor on the silky smooth finish. This is worth checking out and sure to be good value.",,RP (90-92)
907,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Porusot, which is from the domaine's vineyard, has a perfumed brioche and orange blossom-scented bouquet that feels pure and well defined. There is satisfying intensity here. The palate is well balanced with lightly honeyed citrus fruit, commendable weight in the mouth with a punchy, spicy finish. Not bad, although I would want more Meursault-like character to develop once this is in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
908,Louis Jadot,Meursault Narvaux (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault Narvaux has a crisp, dried flower and honeysuckle-tinged bouquet that would benefit from a little more intensity. The palate has more tension and energy than the village cru, fresh and tensile with a spicy, peppery finish that lingers in the mouth. One to drink over the next 4-6 years.",,RP (90-92)
909,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode has the best bouquet of the three Savignys that I tasted from Louis Jadot, a melange of red and black fruit, a subtle dried rose petal note in the background. The palate is well balanced with a prickle of acidity on the entry that counterbalances the tart red cherry and strawberry fruit. There is good weight in the mouth, though like the Clos des Guettes, it just needs to carry a little more weight on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
910,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru en Cailleret has a well-defined nose with resin-like aromas, beeswax and honeysuckle emerging with time. The palate is fresh and clean on the entry, well balanced with good acidity, just a dab of spice towards the second half that feels focused and harmonious. Fine, if just missing that extra spark.",,RP (90-92)
911,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has a clean, correct bouquet with yellow flowers and hints of acacia honey emerging with time. The palate is crisp on the entry with good acidity, waxy in texture with a slightly short finish that will hopefully gain more persistence once in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
912,Louis Jadot,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Valozières (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Valozières has a fragrant, dried rose petal-tinged bouquet with detailed red cherry and crushed strawberry aromas, elegantly unfolding in the glass and certainly offering more complexity than the village cru. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, supple in the mouth with good grip. Maybe it comes across a little heavy towards the finish, but I suspect it will gain more detail by the time it is in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
913,Louis Jadot,Monthélie Sous Roches (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Monthelie les Sous Roches has a perfumed, floral bouquet with pretty redcurrant and wild strawberry scents that seem very pure and neatly integrated with the oak. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and commendable density for a Monthelie. It exerts a gentle grip, suggesting a fine structure to this Monthelie that might last longer than many drinkers will afford it. An excellent Monthelie from Jadot and it comes recommended.",,RP (90-92)
914,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazeys (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazey felt a little subdued on the nose and only reluctantly opened to reveal light woodland scents filtering through the dark berry fruit. The palate is better with fine, quite firm tannin that render it almost Morey-like in style, matched by fine acidity and a slightly serious but appealing finish. Give any bottles a couple of years to just mellow.",,RP (90-92)
915,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Ormes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Ormes has an attractive cranberry and dark berry nose, hints of brown spice/cola just in the background and lending complexity. The palate is medium-bodied with fine definition, a strict and linear Clos des Ormes with a pleasant saline finish that just needs a little more depth.",,RP (90-92)
916,Louis Jadot,Saint Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers Dents de Chien (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Murgers Dents de Chien offers clean and pure lime, green apple and white peach aromas on the nose, a hint of licorice emerging with aeration. The palate is well balanced with sappy citrus fruit on the entry and a composed, citrus peel and spice-infused finish that lingers nicely in the mouth.",,RP (90-92)
917,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Poissenots (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Poissenots has a smudged bouquet of mulberry, cranberry and rose petals, a touch of warmth of the growing season peeking through. The palate is medium-bodied with fine delineation, nicely poised, although it just seems to run out of a few ideas towards the conservative finish (wherein I discern more precision with the Petite Chapelle).",,RP (90-92)
918,Louis Jadot,Chorey-lès-Beaune Beaumonts (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Chorey les Beaune Beaumonts (under the Domaine Gagey label) has a healthy deep color. The nose is vigorous with bright aromas of black plum and redcurrant jus, a slight tinniness that will disappear before bottling. The palate is medium-bodied with good extraction, a structured and masculine Chorey-les-Beaune, broody at the moment with a clean, if slightly short finish. It will hopefully just spread its wings by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
919,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Santenay Clos de Malte has more refinement and purity on the nose than the Santenay Clos des Gatsulards: strawberry and morello cherry, just a hint of vanilla pod. The palate is well balanced with a fine backbone, nicely focused and bright with less of the bitterness coming through on the finish compared to the Gatsulards. Drink over the next 5-6 years.",,RP (90-92)
920,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots displayed a slight metallic note on the nose, though underneath lay plenty of crisp blackberry and black plum fruit, focused if perhaps missing a little charm. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry and I wager showing more class than the aromatics. Nicely balanced with a dash of black pepper on the finish, hopefully the aromatics will improve and just gain a tad more personality by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
921,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts was more austere than the Puligny La Garenne on the nose and needed more coaxing before it offered pleasant, if not riveting grass-clipping and granite aromas. The palate is smooth on the entry with spicy citrus fruit, though I discern more mineralité and tension coming through on the La Garenne at this moment. Let's see how it plays out once in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
922,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles was reduced on the nose when I tasted it from a barrel sample. The palate is ripe on the entry with tropical notes: pineapple and guava, a little low in acidity and as a consequence, feels a little smudged on the finish. Hopefully it will gain more nerve by the time it is in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
923,Louis Jadot,Santenay 1er Cru Clos Rousseau (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Santenay 1er Cru Clos Rousseau has a very ""airy"" bouquet with red cherries and bergamot tea aromas, perhaps requiring just a little more complexity in view of its premier cru status. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly pinched opening, a pinch of Asian spice tincturing the red fruit, segueing into a slightly broody, but nicely structured finish. It will require a year or two in bottle before broaching.",,RP (90-92)
924,Louis Jadot,Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes has a fine, fruit-laden bouquet with ample red cherry and cranberry fruit, well defined with neatly integrated oak. The palate is well balanced with a gentle grip on the entry, dark plum and cranberry notes and fine balance, although it just seems to clam up a little on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
925,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée Village has an uncomplicated but attractive raspberry and wild strawberry-scented bouquet. The palate has a nice piquancy on the entry, builds in the mouth to a structured finish that is detailed and focused, though just shortchanges a little on the aftertaste. Still, this is a very decent Vosne-Romanée.",,RP (90-92)
926,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru en l'Ormeau (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru en l'Ormeau, under the Domaine Gagey label, has an appealing, quite rounded bouquet with ample red cherry, strawberry and cranberry fruit, a touch of dried honey giving away the warmth of the growing season in the background. The palate is smooth and cohesive on the entry with moderate depth, although I found the finish taciturn and needing more mineralité and tension to come through. I would look for some melioration by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
927,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre Blanc (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses Clos de la Croix de Pierre has an enticing bouquet with tropical tones: papaya, mango and guava that render this very seductive. The palate is fresh on the entry with a pinch of white pepper, moderate depth with a lively, spicy finish. This is worth seeking out and a well-crafted and commercial, yet satisfying white Burgundy.",,RP (90-92)
928,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet Villages is more successful than its Meursault counterpart this year. It has a pleasant, simple, tropical-tinged bouquet with wild honey and brioche scents developing. The palate is well balanced with a soft, slightly yeasty entry with good acidity and fine salinity on the finish. This comes recommended.",,RP (90-92)
929,Louis Jadot,Côte de Nuits Villages Le Vaucrain (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Côte de Nuits Village Le Vaucrain has a slightly aloof, dark berry and earl grey-tinged bouquet that is very appealing. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, not a wine of great finesse, but it offers plenty of depth and roundness, the finish offering a surfeit of delicious red cherry and strawberry fruit.",,RP (90-92)
930,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Blagny (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault Blagny has an unapologetically tropical-driven bouquet with pineapple and mango to the fore, a generous dab of honey ramming home the point. The palate is balanced with good acidity, quite linear and feels just a little muted on the finish, as if it wants to leave the aromatics to do all the talking. Give it 2-3 years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
931,Louis Jadot,Meursault Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault Villages has quite a rich bouquet with clear honey and brioche aromas rather disguising its origins at the moment. The palate is crisp on the entry, again well balanced with a fine threat of acidity, though I would like more Meursault character, that trademark nuttiness, to come through on the finish by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
932,Louis Jadot,Ladoix Le Clou d'Orge (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Ladoix le Clou d'Orge, under the Domaine Gagey label, has a sense of airiness on the nose with light acacia honey and jasmine aromas. The palate is balanced with a slightly viscous opening, a fine seam of acidity with candied orange peel towards the finish. Recommended.",,RP (90-92)
933,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Blanc (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Marsannay Blanc includes one hectare of pigmented Chardonnay conveniently called ""Rosé"". It has an attractive, lightly honeyed bouquet with white flowers, brioche and light yeasty aromas. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite taut and linear, good energy with a spicy, almost resinous finish. Enjoy this over the next 4-6 years.",,RP (90-92)
934,Louis Jadot,Maranges 1er Cru Les Fussières (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Maranges 1er Cru Les Fussières has an already open, expressive bouquet; not the most complex with its crushed strawberry and raspberry fruit, just a little ephemeral for a Marnages. The palate is sweet on the entry with candied red fruit and noticeable acidity following on from the three Santenays that I tried directly before. Edgy and tensile, this should age nicely over the next 5-7 years.",,RP (90-92)
935,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet Villages has a light citrus and green apple-scented bouquet that needs more vigor (although this was not the final blend). The palate is ripe on the entry with a slightly viscous texture, honeyed compared to the 2014 with a touch of freshly shaved ginger on the finish. For early drinking, over the next 3-5 years.",,RP (90-92)
936,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Combottes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses Combottes (under ""Domaine Gagey"" rather than Louis Jadot) has an attractive bouquet with green apple, lime and a touch of vanilla essence. There is a satisfying sense of energy interwoven. The palate is crisp and taut with a crisp line of acidity, pear and nectarine complemented by a touch of spice towards the finish. Feisty and enjoyable - probably good value.",,RP (90-92)
937,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Bourgogne le Chapitre, from a very underestimated vineyard in my opinion, has a lovely ripe red cherry and strawberry-scented bouquet. The palate is sweet and supple with good depth, a fine bead of acidity and a simple yet delicious, tart cherry finish. Enjoy this over the next 3-4 years.",,RP (90-92)
938,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Saint Aubin Village had a pleasant reduction on the nose, while the palate has crisp acidity, a little flinty in style with a touch of spice towards the pretty finish. It might lack the weight and presence you would expect, but it is well balanced and focused. Drink over the next 3-4 years.",,RP (90-92)
939,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Savigny les Beaune 1Er Cru Clos des Guettes, under the ""Domaine Gaget"" label, was reduced to six barrels this year. It has a composed bouquet with white peach and dried pineapple scents, a touch of candle wax in the background. The palate is nicely balanced with a spicy, lemongrass-tinged opening, although it seems to fade a little prematurely towards the finish when you were hoping it would build. Not bad overall, but the 2014 was in a different class.",,RP (90-92)
940,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges Village has a slightly compact but focused bouquet, perhaps at the moment not delivering the ""flow"" or amplitude of the Vosne-Romanée Village. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, a little rustic in style, balanced if just needing to show more complexity and tension on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
941,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte Blanc (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Santenay Clos de Malte (Blanc) has a potent orange zest, lemon curd and yellow plum-scented bouquet that offers a satisfying brightness. The palate is fresh on the entry with lime and green apple. It comes across a tad more austere than the aromatics suggest, but with a pleasant, if rather short finish.",,RP (90-92)
942,Louis Jadot,Volnay Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Volnay Villages has an uncomplicated bouquet with dark cherry and briary scents, just a little straightlaced for a Volnay. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin. There is good weight in the mouth, quite sinewy in style, although it needs to express more Volnaysian character to merit a higher score.",,RP (90-92)
943,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières boasts the finest and most sophisticated bouquet among Jadot's premier cru Meursaults: scents of yellow plum, dandelion, sunflower seeds and lemon curd. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, good weight in the mouth, though it needs more acidity to cut through the richness on the finish. I suspect this will gain more tension by the time of bottling.",,RP (90-92)
944,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Garenne (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Garenne has an attractive bouquet: red apple, pear drop and citrus fruit, reserved but growing in stature in the glass. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a clean line of acidity, fresh and crisp with a tensile, understated finish that has class. This is a well-crafted Puligny, if not quite up there with last year's 2014.",,RP (90-92)
945,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Saint Georges (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Saint Georges felt a little withdrawn on the nose when I tasted it, missing the depth and breeding I look for in the auspicious vineyard. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red and black fruit. There is a firm backbone here, a nascent hardness that will disappear with bottling and bottle age. It is a wine of substance that needs to muster personality and grace.",,RP (90-92)
946,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons was more closed than its Beaune ""siblings"" and only reluctantly offered scents of undergrowth-tinged red berry fruit, hints of brown spices emerging with time and suggesting a more complex aromatic profile down the line. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, good weight and more sappiness than the Beaune Grèves, if not quite the same degree of detail. Still, this is a commendable 2015 that perhaps just needs to step up its game once in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
947,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Baudines (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Baudines has a floral nose, buttercups and dandelion mixed with light citrus peel and baked bread aromas. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry, well balanced with a keen thread of acidity, not quite as sophisticated or as nuanced as the 2015 Chassagne Embazées, but with commendable persistence on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
948,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre has a lovely blackcurrant leaf and raspberry-scented bouquet that is both detailed and focused. The palate is medium-bodied with a supple texture, a racy line of acidity, leading to a harmonious black cherry and quite spicy finish that lingers in the mouth. This is a very fine Pernand-Vergelesses from Louis Jadot.",,RP (90-92)
949,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Clos de la Commaraine (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pommard 1er Cru Clos de la Commaraine has an outgoing and almost Volnay-like bouquet with copious red cherry and strawberry tart aromas neatly integrated with the oak. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet ripe red cherry and raspberry fruit, fine tannin and a pleasant spice-tinged finish that lingers in the mouth. This is simply a lovely Pommard to enjoy over the next decade.",,RP (90-92)
950,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Les Longeroies (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Marsannay les Longeroies has a well-defined bouquet with ample red cherry and strawberry fruit; a touch of bergamot and iris in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red cherry and strawberry fruit, plenty of joie-de-vivre here with a brisk, playful finish. This is a delight.",,RP (90-92)
951,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Clos du Roy (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Marsannay Clos du Roy, under the ""Domaine Gagey"" label, has a satisfying, plump, small red cherry, kirsch and orange zest-scented bouquet that captures the precocity of Marsannay without spilling over into blowsiness. The palate is smooth on the entry with supple tannin that lend this a smooth, silky texture. The red cherry and kirsch fruit is complemented by a touch of brown spice towards the finish, completing what feels like an accessible but very delicious Marsannay.",,RP (90-92)
952,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos des Gatsulards Monopole (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots showed a subtle patisserie scent on the nose, a hint of baking powder behind the veneer of raspberry coulis and strawberry aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly grainy texture, a mixture of red and black fruit leading to a sappy, quite tensile finish. Not a bad Santenots by any means, though a couple of paces behind the rest of the pack.",,RP (85-87)
953,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes felt a little basic and too primal on the nose, somewhat anonymous after some of Jadot's other 2015 whites. The palate is well balanced with simple, lightly honeyed fruit, moderate acidity, but again the finish does not have much to say, does not quite get a grip of this fine vineyard. Let's see if it meliorates by the time of bottling.",,RP (85-87)
954,Louis Jadot,Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Bouzeron Village was a little cloudy in the glass. Nevertheless, the aromatics appeared quite pure with melon and nectarine aromas. The palate has quite a sharp sour ""bite"" on the entry, moderate weight with a slightly muffled finish. Probably this Bouzeron will be for early drinking only.",,RP (85-87)
955,Louis Jadot,Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Santenay 1er Cru Gravières Blanc was showing some reduction on the nose when I tasted it. The palate is lightly honeyed on the entry, phenolic in style with a sense of heaviness that drags it down. I don't think the 2015 suited this warm site and preferred the 2014 last year.",,RP (85-87)
956,Louis Jadot,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru felt a little odd on the nose, very high-toned and floral to the point where it obscured its Corton origins. (Winemaker Frédéric Barnier told me it was a very late malolactic and had spent a little longer in new barrel.) The palate is sweet and candied, very ripe and powerful, perhaps picked a couple of days late because for me, there is excessive sucrosity on the finish. I will seek to re-taste this at a later point.",,RP (85-87)
957,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru was showing a pleasant reduction on the nose. The are plenty of clean and crisp redcurrant and cranberry fruit, hints of lavender and cassis. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe red cherry and wild strawberry fruit, very fine tannin, good backbone with a wondrous, complex, spice-tinged finish that has impressive persistence, more than a minute perhaps. This is a superb Chapelle-Chamberlin from Jadot. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (85-87)
958,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques has a composed bouquet with dark cherry, red plum, a light estuarine influence seeping through with aeration, all with good intensity and focus. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, plenty of blackcurrant and raspberry fruit, tensile with a brisk and quite punchy finish. I thought it might be Bruno Clair's Clos Saint Jacques before its identity was revealed - a classy number from the Jadot team. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (85-87)
959,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Demoiselle Grand Cru, bottled under DIAM, was showing a little oxidation on the nose that shaves away mineralité and terroir expression. The palate is tangy and a little chewy on the entry with hints of marmalade and orange peel. While there is satisfying weight in the mouth, it is missing some precision at the moment. The harmony here and the tension suggest that this should develop for those with the nous to age their bottles for several years. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (85-87)
960,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne has a generous bouquet that is lifted by some rather obvious creamy new oak. You might describe it as a punter friendly Puligny. The palate is balanced with moderate weight, a little simple, and you could argue that it does not deliver the personality of some of its peers. It is a satisfying Clos de la Garonne, even if it does not quite fulfill my expectations from barrel. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (85-87)
961,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, which was bottled under DIAM, has an attractive nose with dried honey, grapefruit and beeswax aromas, though it seems to lose some of its definition in the glass. The palate is ripe and honeyed on the entry, waxy in texture and quite spicy, though what it lacks is precision and complexity on its rather predictable finish. This just falls short of my expectations from barrel. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (85-87)
962,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Maison Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières was showing plenty of new oak on the vanilla-laced, almost buttery bouquet. There is too much botrytis here. The palate is well balanced with candied orange peel and peachy notes, rich and generous but missing genuine Puligny-like characteristics. This was another 2013 white closed under DIAM that seemed a little denuded of character. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (85-87)
963,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has an animated, quite oaky bouquet that veers towards black fruit rather than red. It does not quite ""flow"" like others, a bit green perhaps. The palate is actually better with succulent tannin, a keen line of acidity, though it tapers in and feels raw on the finish. It is a disappointing wine from Jadot and this is the second time that I have tasted it blind. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (85-87)
964,Louis Jadot,Chablis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Chablis Villages, matured entirely in stainless steel, has a delineated citrus lemon and flint scented bouquet that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is balanced with crisp acidity, fine tension with a pleasant saline finish. This forms a very competent Chablis Village.",,RP (85-87)
965,Louis Jadot,Beaujolais (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Beaujolais is noticeably deep in color. It offers dark berry fruit on the nose, though I find it missing a little joie de vivre considering the vintage, like a party-goer refusing to dance. The palate is medium-bodied with simple black cherry and strawberry fruit, clean and fresh on the finish. It's a kind of ""in and out"" Beaujolais that goes about its business with minimum fuss. Not bad, although there are better in 2015.",,RP (85-87)
966,Louis Jadot,Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chablis 1Er Cru Fourchaume, which spent 13-15 months on the lees, has a perfumed, floral bouquet with hints of rose petal infusing the citrus fruit lacked with dried pineapple. The palate is fresh and vibrant with good depth in the mouth. This feels harmonious and nicely poised, the salinity surfacing towards the sappy finish, and begging you back for another sip. This is an excellent, well-crafted Chablis Fourchaume from Jadot.",,RP (85-87)
967,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses was vinified in both stainless steel and Burgundy barrels; it has quite a pronounced waxy bouquet with damp earthy scents tincturing the citrus fruit. It just needs a little more cohesion at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, rounded and quite opulent in the mouth, with slightly lower in acidity than I would have preferred; however, it is still showing a sensual side of Chablis on the finish that is very appealing, plus a spicy aftertaste that lingers nicely.",,RP (85-87)
968,Louis Jadot,Chablis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chablis Villages has a rather conservative bouquet that is clean and delineated, but lacks real complexity. The palate is balanced with a pleasant, bitter lemon entry, but it does not really build on that and finishes in a rather orthodox and ordinary fashion. Personally, I find more to enjoy with the 2015 Chablis.",,RP (85-87)
969,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 1969 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes sported a burnished golden hue, commensurate with its age. There was a slight mustiness on the nose, resinous and earthy, Seville orange marmalade loitering in the background. The palate has a pleasant viscosity, surprisingly rich and opulent, almost like a slightly oxidized old Barsac. What it misses is the requisite tension on the finish. Tasted December 2015.",,RP (85-87)
970,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chambertin Grand Cru has a lot of finesse and composure on the nose and to be honest, it shows the 2014 Mazis-Chambertin how it's done -- very focused and complex with great tension and energy. The palate is very well balanced with fine, supple tannin. It is beautifully focused, very natural and effortless with a lingering, minerally finish that goes on and on. This is predictably one of the standouts from Jadot this year.",,RP (85-87)
971,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Musigny Grand Cru has a pure, enticing, quite regal bouquet with red plum and blackberry scents, wild hedgerow and wilted rose petals -- all very nuanced, so much so that you almost miss its intrinsic intensity. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, very well judged acidity and tangible mineralité, especially on the precise finish that carries enormous persistence as it fans out.",,RP (85-87)
972,Louis Jadot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Clos St Denis Grand Cru, from 55-year-old vines (more or less), has a very pure, delineated, sophisticated bouquet with captivating purity. It is actually more Clos de la Roche in style! The palate is very sensual on the entry with dark plum, sea salt and a hint of juniper berry. The tannins are fine but form a framework around the long finish, completing an impressive and delicious Clos Saint Denis from Jadot.",,RP (85-87)
973,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru has a much more nuanced bouquet than the Chevalier Montrachet, brilliantly defined but more conservative in some ways. It gently unfurls in the glass with touches of citrus peel, flint and melted wax, although I found the Chevalier more engaging at the moment. The palate is supremely well balanced with perfect acidity, just a hint of honey floating in the background, but perhaps missing a little complexity and detail on the finish compared to both the Chevalier and the Bâtard. This is very fine, but it is not the grand cru that I would choose from Louis Jadot...at least not this year.",,RP (85-87)
974,Louis Jadot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru is much more convincing and energetic on the nose compared to the Bienvenue with upfront, flinty scents storming from the glass. The palate has a touch of viscosity on the entry, predicating a powerful and broad shouldered Bâtard that is determined to make an impression, which it does. It is very well balanced, very intense and just a lovely white grand cru Burgundy.",,RP (85-87)
975,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Amoureuses has a more engaging nose than the 2014 Bonnes-Mares at the moment, with vivacious blueberry and raspberry coulis scents, and an underlying mineralité that draws you in. The palate is medium-bodied with crisper tannin than the aforementioned grand cru, fine tension, quite linear in style with a tingle of spice towards the gentle but sophisticated finish. It is a more restrained Amoureuses from Jadot, but one exuding class.",,RP (85-87)
976,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vaucrains (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Vaucrains has a stylish bouquet with ebulliant red cherry, strawberry and cold stone scents that are beautifully defined. The palate is ripe and sensual on the entry with a keen line of acidity. The tannin here really express the propitious nature of les Vaucrains, imparting impressive detail and precision on the long, sustained finish. Superb!",,RP (85-87)
977,Louis Jadot,Corton Grèves Grand Cru (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Corton Grèves Grand Cru, which Frédéric Barnier told me was one of very few that reached full yield this year since it was not touched by hail, has a slight metallic note from a little reduction on the nose, although there appears to be plenty of red berry fruit underneath. The palate is well balanced with supple ripe tannin, crisp red cherry and raspberry notes, a gentle fanning out towards the finish that caresses this mouth. This should become a very winsome Corton Grèves -- lovely!",,RP (85-87)
978,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru Les Baudes has a more expressive nose than the Feusselottes, more floral and perhaps, more Chambolle-like. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, crisp acidity and tension. There is finesse here and composure, allied with fine focus and poise on the finish -- a delicious and well crafted, quite succinct Chambolle.",,RP (85-87)
979,Louis Jadot,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru has a much more complex and nuanced bouquet compared to the 2014 Echézeaux, with lively red berry fruit intermingling with minerals. It gains intensity in the glass while retaining its composure. The palate is grippy on the entry with good density -- a compact but delineated Grands Echézeaux that will require bottle age. It is more masculine than others I have tasted, but it has the body and breeding you look for.",,RP (85-87)
980,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Combettes offers convincing mineral tension on the nose that is very well focused. The palate is crisp and taut, well defined with a palpable sense of energy -- the Puligny leaping about like a toddler. There is plenty of character about this Puligny Combettes with a seam of freshly shaved ginger furnishing the finish. This is excellent.",,RP (85-87)
981,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots has a tightly wound bouquet with light mineral tones that become more accentuated with time. I would like to see more roundness come through. The palate is ripe on the entry and here there is more Suchots character with lovely raspberry and crushed strawberry fruit, orange zest and mandarin. The focus and delineation on the finish is very impressive and it lingers tenderly in the mouth. There is classy winemaking here.",,RP (85-87)
982,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru has a sweeter and riper, if less nuanced and aristocratic bouquet than the 2014 Chambertin. This is all sweetness and light (unusually for Clos de Bèze). The palate is very refined with rounded tannin, well judged acidity and good density. This is backward, almost surly towards the finish, but there is also an attractive spicy edge that comes through on the aftertaste. It may actually need more bottle age than the Chambertin.",,RP (85-87)
983,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has a clean and precise bouquet, tightly wound at first, perhaps aromatics with a leash on it, holding it back for now. The palate is well balanced with grippy red berry fruit laced with bay leaf and a touch of sage. It gently builds towards quite a dense finish that is reminiscent of a Malconsorts. Very fine indeed.",,RP (85-87)
984,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru le Cailleret has a tightly wound bouquet with a smear of dried honey and beeswax, very well defined and poised with lemon curd coming through with aeration. The palate is very well balanced with crisp acidity, lively and lightly spiced, harmonious and more understated than say Jadot's les Folatières. This is one of their most composed white offerings in 2014 with a very long and poised finish. Superb -- I am sure it will reside at the top of my banded score once in bottle.",,RP (85-87)
985,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a pretty, pure and nuanced bouquet that unfolds with time in the glass: red cherries, fresh strawberry and limestone scents, later a touch of rose petal. The palate is smooth and supple with good density, quite saline in the mouth with darker berried fruit fanning out towards the finish that has impressive salinity on the aftertaste. Excellent.",,RP (85-87)
986,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru la Romanée offers attractive scents of citrus fruit, yellow flower and minerals, all nicely defined and gaining in intensity in the glass. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, just a smidgen of sour lemon that enlivens that palate, and with superb salinity and race on the finish. This is one of my favoite white premier crus from Louis Jadot this year.",,RP (85-87)
987,Louis Jadot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru, which comes from three sources, is a little more savory on the nose compared to the Clos Saint Denis, perhaps sans the same level of purity. There is more tertiary notes here, a hint of bacon fat even. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly broader tannin than the Clos Saint Denis that lends it the weight, the presence, albeit without the nervosité or the mineral core expressed by the Clos Saint Denis. Very fine, but I would like to see more nuance develop during the rest of its élevage.",,RP (85-87)
988,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves has a delightful bouquet with redcurrant and cranberry aromas interlaced with vanilla. The palate is nicely structured with crisp acidity, tensile tannin, fresh and nervous, gently unfolding to a precise and focused finish with plenty of red cherries, strawberry and mineral notes. This comes highly recommended.",,RP (85-87)
989,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Fuées (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Fuées has the most complex bouquet, the most engaging and edgy among Jadot's Chambolle premier crus. This just seems...animated. The palate is fresh and smooth on the entry with good depth, plush in the mouth with well judged acidity, a little more extroverted and you could say ""modern"" than the Les Baudes, but with very good persistence on the finish. This is very classy.",,RP (85-87)
990,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières has more complexity and nuance on the nose compared to the 2014 Charmes, with greater mineralité being expressed. The palate is very well balanced with walnut and smoked hazelnut coming through, dialing down through the gears on the finish that is very subtle and poised. This is an excellent Meursault from Louis Jadot.",,RP (85-87)
991,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru Clos de la Garenne, which I thought was a monopole but apparently is not, comes from 90-year-old vines, some of the oldest belonging to Louis Jadot. Despite their age, they are still productive. It has a very refined bouquet with a surfeit of walnut and popcorn scents allied with fine mineralité. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, very tensile with just a twist of bitter lemon lending edginess towards the finish. Very fine, very classy.",,RP (85-87)
992,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Pucelles offers more tropical tones on the nose compared to the 2014 les Folatières -- white peach and apricot coming through, very pure if not quite as mineral-driven. The palate is very well balanced, very cohesive with hints of mandarin and quince in the background, the mineral now in place and driving forward the finish. This is an excellent Les Pucelles from Louis Jadot.",,RP (85-87)
993,Louis Jadot,Fixin Clos Moreau Monopole (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Fixin Clos Moreau has a crisp, well-defined bouquet with light citrus fruit and grass clipping aromas. The palate is nicely balanced with pleasing weight on the entry, hints of tropical fruit, dried pineapple and guava, though it just loses a little focus towards the finish. Otherwise this is fine.",,RP (85-87)
994,Louis Jadot,Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Pommard Village has a simple, earthy, slightly austere bouquet that feels just a little anonymous at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, decent depth of flavor, although like the bouquet, it just lacks some complexity on the finish. Hopefully it will gain more detail by the time of bottling.",,RP (85-87)
995,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis Village felt a little stilted on the nose when I tasted it (especially compared to say, the Vosne-Romanée Village). The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, a little ""chunky"" in the mouth, but with decent depth on the finish. It's just a tad rough-hewn.",,RP (85-87)
996,Louis Jadot,Givry Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2015 Givry Village, which comes from purchased fruit, has a fragrant bouquet with subtle floral scents. There is some reduction here but in a positive sense. The palate is balanced with good structure on the entry, not a complex Givry but there is substance and presence towards the stem ginger and rhubarb-tinged finish.",,RP (85-87)
997,Louis Jadot,Jadot Volnay 1er Cru En l'Ormeau (Domaine Gagey),"The 2015 Saint Romain Village offers tropical scents on the nose: guava, pineapple and ripe peach give this a commercial bent. Nothing wrong with that. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry with a slight waxiness to the texture, a dab of ginger with a clean if uncomplicated finish that suggests this should be enjoyed in its youth.",,RP (91-93)
998,Louis Jadot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Charmes Chambertin Grand Cru perhaps does not quite possess the same detail and clarity as the 2014 Chapelle-Chambertin at the moment. There is abundant red and black fruit -- rounded and floral in nature. The palate is well balanced with a little toastiness on the entry. There is good depth to this Chapelle-Chambertin, nicely structured, but I am seeking more nuance and precision just to come through on the finish. Good, although I have had better vintages in the past.",,RP (91-93)
999,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Blanchot (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Blanchots has one of the more refined and nuanced bouquets from Louis Jadot's Chassagnes this year, one you have to really sit and be patient with. The palate is well balanced and quite powerful, with a lightly honeyed texture. It builds in the mouth towards what is a rich and convincing finish that will leave you wanting more. Excellent.",,RP (91-93)
1000,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules has a clean and precise bouquet in the making, with subtle rose petal scents infusing the red cherry and strawberry fruit -- a mineral seam just underneath. The palate is supple on the entry, fleshy so that you almost miss the structure that frames this Clos des Ursules. There is good tension here with a twist of citrus lemon on the finish. This is impressive and long term.",,RP (91-93)
1001,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot has a sprightly bouquet with lemon curd and almond infusing with the citrus fruit -- like the Chassagne La Romanée, lively and engaging. The palate is fresh and vibrant with tinned apricot and peach on the entry, a dash of lemongrass, but perhaps not quite the same detail as the La Romanée on the finish. Still, this is very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1002,Louis Jadot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru has a very precise, granitic, smoke-tinged bouquet that opens nicely in the glass, gaining more and more intensity. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, elegant and refined, gently building but never letting go fully. As such, it is a more feminine, understated grand cru from Jadot.",,RP (91-93)
1003,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières is more reserved than the 2014 Genevrières on the nose, but there is more mineral, stony scents infiltrating the citrus fruit and the focus here is very impressive. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, touches of smoked walnut and smoke, although I would like to see more stoniness, more rockiness come through on the finish to express this great vineyard. Still a capable Meursault, though it would be the 2014 Genevrières on my own shopping list.",,RP (91-93)
1004,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru Clos St Jacques has a clean and precise bouquet, quite backward compared to recent vintages, and a little terse with black cherry and bergamot notes developing in the glass. The palate is balanced with good density and volume; there is firm tannin that imparts good backbone to this Clos Saint Jacques, though it needs more finesse and nervosité to come through on the finish that feels a little ""blocky"" at the moment, especially when compared to the Chapelle-Chambertin.",,RP (91-93)
1005,Louis Jadot,Mazis-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Mazis Chambertin Grand Cru has a very seductive bouquet with plush redcurrant and wild strawberry scents, briary and undergrowth developing with aeration. The palate is grippy on the entry with firm, slightly grainy tannin. There is something just a little disjointed on the finish...perhaps a few underripe berries that I could not discern on Jadot's other Gevrey grand crus. Let's see how it develops in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1006,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Grands Epenots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Pommard 1er Cru les Grands Epenots has a rather extravagant bouquet, especially for a Pommard, with showy red cherries, raspberry coulis and orange sorbet scents that are nicely defined. This is quite Volnay in style. The palate is clean and fresh, gently gripping the mouth, quite tensile and linear but with appreciable depth on the raspberry, strawberry and sage finish. There is something very ""correct"" about this Grands Epenots. Very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1007,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Boucherottes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Boucherottes has a ripe bouquet with candied orange peel infusing the vibrant red cherry and strawberry fruit. There is something playful about these aromatics. The palate is medium-bodied with grippy tannins, dense and more compact than the Couchereaux, quite saline on the finish with good length and persistence. Superb.",,RP (91-93)
1008,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Santenots (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots has a fragrant nose of blackcurrant pastilles and crushed violet -- all very tightly wound at the moment. The palate is compact on the entry but well defined with saturated tannin, plenty of citrus-infused black and red fruit with nicely integrated oak towards the harmonious, very Santenots finish. Long and persistent in the mouth, this is a very commendable Volnay Santenots from Jadot.",,RP (91-93)
1009,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Savigny lès Beaune 1Er Cru Clos des Guettes Blanc comes from two parcels in the premier cru. It has a detailed and precise bouquet that is nicely focused and displays very good intensity, really delivering those citrus notes and tropical tones with some confidence and verve. The palate is well balanced with an irresistible corpulence that is reined in by the acidity, gently building to an appealing, lightly spiced finish. This is an excellent wine from Louis Jadot and comes highly recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1010,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Corton Pougets Grand Cru has a light marine influence on the nose that laps against the redcurrant and cranberry fruit, just a touch of red plum in the background. The palate is supple and lithe in the mouth, the oak nicely integrated, quite minerally with good density and grip in the finish. It perhaps just lacks a little persistence, but it should age with style.",,RP (91-93)
1011,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles St Jacques has a winsome bouquet with layers of macerated small red cherries, fresh strawberry and vanilla scents that gain intensity in the glass. The palate is fleshy and ripe on the entry, forward and dense with the oak perhaps more conspicuous on the finish than the 2014 Cazetiers. It is trying to make an impression but it needs to show more restraint and composure once in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1012,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Beaune 1Er Cru les Bressandes has a perfumed bouquet with crushed strawberry and raspberry fruit, just a hint of tinned peach in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin. There is good density here, nicely structured with impressive precision despite its broad shouldered nature. Recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1013,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Boudots has a candied, quite feminine bouquet with lush red cherries and crushed strawberry scents interlaced with minerals. The palate is fleshy on the entry with supple tannin, well judged acidity, well integrated oak and quite a structured finish. Perhaps it needs just a little more nuance, but that should develop with time. Good potential here.",,RP (91-93)
1014,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Aux Cras (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Beaune 1Er Cru Aux Cras was slightly more reduced on the nose when I tasted it at the domaine. The fruit feels dark and broody at the moment. The palate is grippy on the entry, predicating a muscular and sinewy Aux Cras that does not want to be messed with. That said, one can already sense the harmony and focus towards the finish, as this wine begins to calm down and lose its nascent temper. Give it 3-4 years...or else.",,RP (91-93)
1015,Louis Jadot,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes has a more linear, very pure red cherry, crushed strawberry and rose petal-tinged bouquet that unfolds nicely in the glass but never gets carried away. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannin, a little spicier in the mouth compared to the Clos de la Barre, while maintaining a sense of elegance. The aftertaste is long and continues that spicy, white pepper theme for 20-30 seconds.",,RP (91-93)
1016,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Couchereaux has a ""placid"" nose, laid back and nonchalant -- Morello cherry and raspberry scents, a touch of cold flint in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with gentle tannins that politely grip the mouth, nicely structured with darker fruit (blackberry and bilberry) forming the masculine finish. Very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1017,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Murgers des Dents de Chien (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Murgers des Dents de Chien has a very engaging nose with scents of white flowers joining the citrus fruit and walnut notes, not that far from a Meursault in style. The palate is smooth and quite rounded on the entry, a brush of honey here both in terms of flavor and texture, that walnut note continuing and a fumé-like finish that lingers nicely in the mouth. This is a very fine Saint Aubin that will give a decade's worth of pleasure.",,RP (91-93)
1018,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes suffered a little less hail damage than Beaune Grèves in this year. It has a well defined, quite pure bouquet with hints of yellow flowers tincturing the citrus fruit that is neatly folded into the oak. The palate is well balanced, quite rounded on the entry with tropical fruit (pineapple and guava), just a touch of lemongrass towards the nicely balanced, modest finish. This is a fine Beaune Bressandes to enjoy over the next decade.",,RP (91-93)
1019,Louis Jadot,Meursault Narvaux (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Meursault Narvaux has a nose that does not hold back, with raucous tropical fruit (pineapple and white peach), later followed by apricot and quince. The palate is very well balanced with good depth and volume. It is not as complex as the premier crus and feels just a little abrupt on the finish, but there is a sense of energy here and it articulates the vineyard with aplomb.",,RP (91-93)
1020,Louis Jadot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru les Charmes has a clean and precise bouquet, one that is tightly wound at the moment, nicely focused, but could benefit from more intensity and terroir expression. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity. I like the edginess here, the subtle lemongrass note that becomes more accentuated towards the finish, even if it does not quite achieve the complexity of some of the best Meursault Charmes in 2014. Still, this is recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1021,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru La Petite Chapelle (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru la Petite Chapelle has a more introspective, broodier nose than Jadot's other Gevrey Premier Crus, here with a stronger marine/iodine influence. The palate is structured and grippy on the entry. This is a masculine, forthright and foursquare Gevrey, but it needs to muster a little more nuance and fleshy on the finish.",,RP (91-93)
1022,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru has an attractive, comely bouquet with notes of popcorn, citrus fruit and shaved almond, all nicely defined. The palate is well balanced with a keen line of acidity, citrus fresh with a touch of orange sorbet, yet like many other 2014 Corton-Charlemagnes, it just seems denuded of material, substance on the finish, as if dipping before the finish line too early. Not bad, but I prefer some of Jadot's premier cru white to this.",,RP (91-93)
1023,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Les Theurons (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Beaune 1Er Cru les Theurons has a pastille-like purity on the nose -- blackcurrant and bilberry fruit, a little more introverted than its peers. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannin, dense in the mouth, minerally and grippy with good persistence on the finish. This is an excellent Beaune Premier Cru from Jadot.",,RP (91-93)
1024,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Saint Georges (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Saint Georges is more reticent on the nose than the 2014 Vaucrains, with less mineralité coming through. Tight-lipped is the word. The palate is rounded and voluminous with thickly layered red berry fruit that present a fine framework, and yet it does not seem to possess the tension and nervosité, the mineral drive of the Vaucrains. Let's see how this develops in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1025,Louis Jadot,Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Guettes (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Savigny les Beaune 1Er Cru Clos des Guettes has more roundness on the nose than Jadot's other 2014 Savignys -- a little more plumpness with strawberry and Morello scents developing. The palate is fleshy on the entry with good weight, a fine line of acidity, fine tannin, very focused with a tensile, quite minerally finish that is very satisfying. This comes highly recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1026,Louis Jadot,Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru Lavaux St Jacques has a Morello cherry and crushed strawberry-scented bouquet with hints of undergrowth and pine in the background. The palate is well balanced with ripe, quite bold tannin. It does not quite have the tension or the finesse of the 2014 Cazetiers, a little stocky and rugged on the finish. Not bad, but it needs more sophistication.",,RP (91-93)
1027,Louis Jadot,Echézeaux Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a tightly-wound, tart red cherry bouquet that needs to forage more complexity during élevage. It seems a little...lackadaisical at the moment. The palate is quite masculine with slightly dry tannin, firm in the mouth with good density, yet it needs to show more precision and focus on the finish. Not bad, but perhaps surpassed by some of Jadot's Vosne Premier crus this year.",,RP (91-93)
1028,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru en Cailleret has a more delicate and understated bouquet compared to its siblings, hints of white flower and almond, just a trace of wet limestone that articulates the terroir here. The palate is well balanced, tensile from the start and quite saline. There is modest depth here, quite linear with a Meursault-like nuttiness developing on the finish. Fine, but mercurial.",,RP (91-93)
1029,Louis Jadot,Fixin Clos Moreau Monopole (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Fixin Clos Moreau, from a site where the fruit ripens relatively easily, has a more complex, perhaps more nuanced bouquet compared to its Marsannay counterpart, with hints of beeswax infiltrating the tropical fruit all with fine definition. The palate is well balanced with a keen line of acidity -- here, a dash of lemongrass on the finish that lends tension and poise. As one of Jadot's entry level whites, this comes recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1030,Louis Jadot,Marsannay (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Marsannay Villages has an expressive nose that captures the essence of Marsannay better than the Clos du Roy (at least at this early stage). It is adorned with attractive blueberry and cassis notes, all nicely defined and joyful. The palate is well balanced with supple, rounded tannin. This feels fleshy in the mouth, quite caressing with a gentle raspberry and dark plum finish interlaced with white pepper and sage. It leaves the mouth tingling with pleasure. Very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1031,Louis Jadot,Saint-Aubin (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Saint Aubin Villages actually contains around 75% to 80% of small parcels from premier cru vineyards. It has a well defined bouquet with touches of dried pineapple and peach skin emerging in the glass with good intensity. The palate is well balanced with good substance on the entry. It is a relatively feisty Saint Aubin with a keen thread of acidity, just a touch of fresh ginger coming through towards the finish. This should give 5-7 years of pleasure, possibly more.",,RP (91-93)
1032,Louis Jadot,Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières Blanc (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières Blanc is a new offering from Jadot. The nose is perhaps just a little more straightforward than I was anticipating: touches of orange blossom and white peach, but missing the intensity of the 2014 Santenay Clos de Malte at this early stage. The palate is nicely balanced and here, perhaps belatedly, the premier cru quality shows through with attractive white peach and mandarin notes, a keen line of acidity and a precise, quite understated finish. Afford this a couple of years in the cellar to allow its character to show through.",,RP (91-93)
1033,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Le Clos Blanc (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves le Clos Blanc was affected by hail this year, but that does not impede upon the nose that in fact has a little more chutzpah than the Beaune Bressandes at the moment. The palate is well balanced, vibrant with a keen line of acidity. There is good depth here, not the most complicated white Beaune you will find, but nicely focused and with a long, tender finish. Very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1034,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle (Duc de Magenta),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot Clos de la Chapelle from Domaine du Duc du Magenta, has a more reserved and stonier bouquet than the La Romanée. Give it a few moments and there are traces of popcorn and almond that come through. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a crisp line of acidity, a little spiciness developing on the finish that gently fans out but never quite fully let's go. Give it a couple of years in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1035,Louis Jadot,Meursault Blagny,"The 2014 Meursault Blagny has a delightful, quite tensile bouquet that has more detail than the 2014 Meursault Narvaux at this early juncture. The palate is nicely balanced with a pleasing fatness in the mouth, honeyed in texture, though that seems to shave away some of the nervosité and tension that it might have had on the finish. Still very appealing, drink this over the next 6-8 years.",,RP (91-93)
1036,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Feusselottes (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Feusselottes has a comely bouquet in the making with strawberry shortcake and warm gravel scents that gain intensity in the glass. The palate has good weight on the entry with crisp acidity, quite compact at the moment with just a little abrasiveness to address towards the finish. Give this a couple of years in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1037,Louis Jadot,Monthélie 1er Cru Champs Fulliot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Monthélie Champs Fuillot 1er Cru has more volume and plumpness on the nose compared to the 2014 Sous Roches at the moment: raspberry coulis mixed with crushed strawberry and a touch of volatile acidity giving it some lift. The palate is clean and crisp on the entry. The tannins are fine here, nicely focused, a slight bitterness towards the finish, but there is appreciable tension and nerve here. Drink over several years.",,RP (91-93)
1038,Louis Jadot,Pommard 1er Cru Rugiens (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Pommard 1er Cru Rugiens has a crisp redcurrant and strawberry pastille-scented bouquet that perhaps does not quite have the complexity of the Grands Epenots. The palate is supple on the entry with a gentle grip. There is good density to this Rugiens, a little sinew towards the finish and perhaps more oak to be subsumed, so afford this 2-3 years in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
1039,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Savigny les Beaune 1Er Cru les Lavières has a pretty bouquet with small red cherries and blackberry scents that are quite precocious. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin, well judged acidity, very focused and harmonious with a vivacious, tart cherry finish that is a delight. Good show!",,RP (91-93)
1040,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre Blanc (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Pernand Vergelesses 1er Cru Clos de la Croix de Pierre has a refined bouquet, quite floral in nature with yellow flowers percolating through the citrus fruit. The palate is well balanced with good weight in the mouth, the acidity nicely judged with a hint of spice emerging towards what feels like a restrained finish that does not want to let go. Perhaps a little straight laced for its own good, yet this is still a well crafted, precise and appealing 2014 Pernand.",,RP (91-93)
1041,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Baudines (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Baudines has a similarly powerful nose like the les Blanchots, here with wax resin, honeysuckle aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with a spicy entry, touches of nutmeg and grilled walnut, leading to a generous, nutty finish that is just missing a little focus and detail. Still, this is a fine Chassagne to enjoy over the next few years.",,RP (91-93)
1042,Louis Jadot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Savigny les Beaune 1er Cru la Dominode is more reticent on the nose than the les Lavières at the moment, more laid-back, taciturn perhaps, but the fruit is well defined. The palate has a prickle of spice on the entry, the fruit darker than the le Lavières, a little chalky and hard towards the finish, although that should soften with time. It needs a couple of years in bottle, but should turn out fine.",,RP (91-93)
1043,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Chaumes has the most ebullient and carefree bouquet of Jadot's Vosne Premier Crus with zesty red berry fruit and a captivating underlying mineralité. The palate is grippy on the entry with good density. The oak feels more conspicuous here compared to the Les Suchots and perhaps it shaves away some of the precision that it might have had. Hopefully it will regain some detail as it ages in bottle, because certainly there is the substance here to merit long term aging.",,RP (91-93)
1044,Louis Jadot,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru has a very succinct bouquet with red plum and blueberry fruit that are nicely defined, the oak nicely integrated, though not as extroverted as other Bonnes-Mares that I have tasted. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded, supple tannin. I like the acidity here, although it remains surprisingly linear and contained on the finish when you are anticipating that ""peacock's tail"" that flourishes, as one associates with Bonnes-Mares. Perhaps too well behaved at the moment? Hopefully it will let its hair down with bottle age.",,RP (91-93)
1045,Louis Jadot,Corton-Clos du Roi Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru clearly has the most ostentatious bouquet of the three Cortons from Louis Jadot with bold black cherry, red plum and bergamot aromas swarming from the glass. The palate is well balanced with good volume, a Corton of length, breadth and volume, though I might just prefer the finesse demonstrated by the Corton Grèves. If you like a little hedonism in your Corton however, go for this.",,RP (91-93)
1046,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1Er Cru Cazetiers is a large step up from the village cru with a different level of tension and mineralité. The palate is very cohesive with supple tannin, very well judged acidity, real density and poise, with a dash of white pepper and sage on the finish. There is a lot of charm and passion about this Cazetiers and it comes highly recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1047,Louis Jadot,Jadot Volnay 1er Cru En l'Ormeau (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru en l'Ormeau has a slight savory edge on the nose: vibrant red berry fruit, a hint of cured meat perhaps, almost ferrous. The palate is supple on the entry with a seductive roundness, fine tannins (perhaps finer than the Santenots) with a very cohesive and convincing, sorbet-fresh finish. What a gorgeous Volnay! This comes highly recommended.",,RP (91-93)
1048,Louis Jadot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Charmes Chambertin Grand Cru perhaps does not quite possess the same detail and clarity as the 2014 Chapelle-Chambertin at the moment. There is abundant red and black fruit -- rounded and floral in nature. The palate is well balanced with a little toastiness on the entry. There is good depth to this Chapelle-Chambertin, nicely structured, but I am seeking more nuance and precision just to come through on the finish. Good, although I have had better vintages in the past.",,RP (91-93)
1049,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Blanchot (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Blanchots has one of the more refined and nuanced bouquets from Louis Jadot's Chassagnes this year, one you have to really sit and be patient with. The palate is well balanced and quite powerful, with a lightly honeyed texture. It builds in the mouth towards what is a rich and convincing finish that will leave you wanting more. Excellent.",,RP (91-93)
1050,Louis Jadot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Ursules has a clean and precise bouquet in the making, with subtle rose petal scents infusing the red cherry and strawberry fruit -- a mineral seam just underneath. The palate is supple on the entry, fleshy so that you almost miss the structure that frames this Clos des Ursules. There is good tension here with a twist of citrus lemon on the finish. This is impressive and long term.",,RP (91-93)
1051,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot has a sprightly bouquet with lemon curd and almond infusing with the citrus fruit -- like the Chassagne La Romanée, lively and engaging. The palate is fresh and vibrant with tinned apricot and peach on the entry, a dash of lemongrass, but perhaps not quite the same detail as the La Romanée on the finish. Still, this is very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1052,Louis Jadot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru has a very precise, granitic, smoke-tinged bouquet that opens nicely in the glass, gaining more and more intensity. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, elegant and refined, gently building but never letting go fully. As such, it is a more feminine, understated grand cru from Jadot.",,RP (87-89)
1053,Louis Jadot,Monthélie Sous Roches (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Montélie les Sous Roches, under the Domaine Louis Jadot label, has a straightforward Morello cherry and cassis-scented nose that is pretty and nicely defined. Very Monthélie! The palate is fresh and crisp with good density for a Monthélie, a little tough at the moment and needing to flesh out on the finish, but that will come with racking.",,RP (87-89)
1054,Louis Jadot,Chorey-lès-Beaune Beaumonts (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Chorey les Beaune Beaumonts has a fragrant, pure bouquet with perfumed red cherry and crushed strawberry scents that are nicely defined. The palate is clean and fresh with tensile tannin, plenty of tart cherry fruit, with just a touch of hardness towards the abrupt finish; but there is nice length and plenty of freshness here. Give it 12 months in bottle.",,RP (87-89)
1055,Louis Jadot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Villages has a simple dark berry and bay leaf-scented bouquet that just needs a little more joie de vivre. The palate is sweet and chewy on the entry with a fine line of acidity, good weight and presence in the mouth with just a dash of spice on the finish. It is simple but effective.",,RP (87-89)
1056,Louis Jadot,Côte de Nuits-Villages Le Vaucrain (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Côte de Nuits Villages le Vaucrain has a perfumed bouquet with black cherries and pastille-like scents almost reluctantly emerging from the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple cherry and redcurrant fruit, demonstrating fine weight and nicely integrated oak on the appealing finish. This is recommended.",,RP (87-89)
1057,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Garenne (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne has a well defined bouquet with green apple and touches of white peach, delicate at first but gaining intensity with aeration. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, nicely weighted in the mouth but just missing some tension and nervosité towards the finish. Drink over the next 5-7 years.",,RP (87-89)
1058,Louis Jadot,Pernand-Vergelesses Les Combottes (Maison Louis Jadot),"The third vintage from the parcel purchased in 2012, the 2014 Pernand Vergelesses Combottes has a more understated bouquet compared to the nascent Clos de la Croix de Pierre, but it is still well defined and focused with lime flower, green apple and subtle resinous scents. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry, the acidity a little sharper than the aforementioned, but just missing a little complexity on the finish at the moment, just a little taciturn when you want it to ""spread its wings"" and live a little. Hopefully it will gain something once in bottle.",,RP (87-89)
1059,Louis Jadot,Chassagne-Montrachet (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet Village will contain some barrels from premier cru vineyards, although my sample did not include these. It has a well defined, nicely focused bouquet that is quite Puligny-like in style. The palate is fresh on the entry, quite understated at first but gaining in confidence with light nutty tones, although it becomes just a little loose-knit towards the finish. Once those deselected barrels are added it will be better and towards the top of my banded score.",,RP (87-89)
1060,Louis Jadot,Vosne-Romanée Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Village felt a little rustic on the nose, needing a little more cohesion. The palate is well balanced, chewy in the mouth and quite firm, with good weight if needing more finesse on the finish. That said, it is cheaper than La Tâche and I probably have no complaints for the price.",,RP (87-89)
1061,Louis Jadot,Fixin (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Fixin Villages has a slightly conservative but nicely defined blackcurrant pastille and redcurrant nose, although it feels just a little constrained at the moment. The palate is well balanced with chewy tannins that render this a little rustic compared to Jadot's other 2014s, though there is presence and structure here. Partner this Fixin with a big hearty steak and you will be fine.",,RP (87-89)
1062,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin Villages has a simple red cherry and raspberry-scented nose that seems quite rounded and Chambolle-like. The palate is supple on the entry with fleshy red berry fruit, good density, though it cuts away a little swiftly towards the finish.",,RP (87-89)
1063,Louis Jadot,Meursault Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Meursault Villages was tasted from a representative blend that comes from a variety of lieux-dits around the appellation (the assemblage will be done at the end of the élevage). The nose is quite intense, the barrel influence a little stronger than I expected, but still nicely defined. The palate is well balanced with a saline entry and a keen thread of acidity, although it needs to muster more complexity towards what is a too straight forward finish. Maybe that will come once the final blend is made.",,RP (87-89)
1064,Louis Jadot,Morey-Saint-Denis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Morey Saint Denis Villages felt a little disjointed on the nose when I tasted it, so perhaps is just needs more time during élevage to knit together. The palate is balanced, simple and clean, though it needs to show more complexity and terroir-specifics towards what is a rather generic finish.",,RP (87-89)
1065,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny Les Drazeys (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Chambolle-Musigny les Drazey has a light, simple, slightly floral bouquet with crushed strawberry and orange peel scents. The palate is chunky in the mouth with firm tannins, almost Morey-like in style, and perhaps just a little ""clipped"" on the finish.",,RP (87-89)
1066,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos de Malte (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Santenay Clos de Malte has a pleasant, fleshy, crushed strawberry-scented bouquet with a hint of vanilla, demonstrating more fruité at the moment compared to the 2014 Clos des Gatsulard. The palate is brittle and chalky on the entry, but there is some pleasant, pert, tart cherry fruit underneath. It might lack a little length, but there is some freshness and tension here.",,RP (87-89)
1067,Louis Jadot,Volnay Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Volnay Village has a pretty nose of dark cherry and cold stone scents. The palate is clean and fresh with a taut line of acidity, quite structured and like many Volnay in this finish, has the austere finish of a Pommard. Still, there is good fruit concentration here, if not quite the length.",,RP (87-89)
1068,Louis Jadot,Bouzeron (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Bouzeron Village from Domaine Gagey, due to be bottled in the end of November, has a fragrant, well defined nose with a brush of lemon curd and lime flower. This is already attractive. The palate is lively on the entry with quite piercing acidity. Shrill almost? It needs to just calm down and develop a little more substance on the finish to balance that acidity and match the quality of the nose.",,RP (87-89)
1069,Louis Jadot,Marsannay Clos du Roy (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Marsannay Clos du Roy (Domaine Gagey) has a slightly reduced nose that did not quite express the ebullient character of Marsanny as it should. The palate is chewy on the entry, a little coarse perhaps with firm tannin and a touch of hardness on the finish. Hopefully it should soften by the time of bottling, but it needs to show more character of the appellation.",,RP (87-89)
1070,Louis Jadot,Pommard Village (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Pommard Villages, which may include the deselected fruit from Pommard la Commaraine, has a sweet, juicy and simple bouquet. The palate is sweet and supple, quite rounded, a little rustic with a chewy redcurrant and cranberry finish.",,RP (87-89)
1071,Louis Jadot,Bourgogne Le Chapitre (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Bougogne le Chapitre from Domaine Gagey has a simple, clean red cherry and citru-scented bouquet. The palate is nicely balanced, soft but with good weight in the mouth, light and precise for a Bourgogne Rouge on the finish. Its tasty cherry fruit is very appealing.",,RP (87-89)
1072,Louis Jadot,Saint-Romain (Maison Louis Jadot),"There are 33 barrels of the 2014 St Romain Blanc this year after new contracted growers were found. There is something almost 'leisurely' on the nose that is nicely detailed but prefers not to expend too much energy at the moment. The palate is fresh on the entry, a little tight at the moment and I am looking for more substance to come through on the finish that is just a little monochromatic at present.",,RP (87-89)
1073,Louis Jadot,Santenay Clos des Gatsulards Monopole (Domaine Gagey),"The 2014 Santenay Clos de Gatsulard, which is under the Domaine Gagey label, has a light cranberry-scented bouquet, clean and airy. The palate is crisp and sharp, a little ""bony"" in the mouth with some hardness towards the finish that needs to soften and flesh out by the time of bottling.",,RP (87-89)
1074,Louis Jadot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chapelle Chambertin Grand Cru from Louis Jadot has a very perfumed and floral nose with dried violet petals infusing the mixture or red and black fruit. This gains intensity in the glass, hints of winegum developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and well judged acidity, the oak beautifully interwoven. It is still very backward, more so than the say Cécile Tremblay's Chapelle-Chambertin, but there is a pleasing sense of tension and race on the long, truffle tinged finish that has just the right amount of bitterness. This could be a wine that will continue to improve, the longer it is left in bottle. Do not underestimate this exemplary Grand Cru.",,RP (87-89)
1075,Louis Jadot,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jacques (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru Clos Saint Jacques from Louis Jadot, which has deepest in colour of the five growers, the has entrancing purity on the nose: dark cherries mixed with cranberry leaf, bergamot and minerals all beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe tannin, quite a firm grip in the mouth, the result of a firm backbone. I actually thought this might have been Sylvie Esmonin's Clos Saint Jacques. This is a long-term proposition - patience required!",,RP (87-89)
1076,Louis Jadot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru  from Louis Jadot has a more complex bouquet compared to its peers with subtle yellow flower, beeswax and honeysuckle scents that gently waft from the glass. The palate is well balanced with a lightly honeyed entry and good presence in the mouth. It does not deliver otherworldly complexity, but there is a lot of ""wine"" here (to put it banally) with a pleasant tang of dried orange peel on the finish. This is worth seeking out.",,RP (87-89)
1077,Louis Jadot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru from Louis Jadot has a lifted, licorice-tinged bouquet with plenty of guts to it. There aromatics do not hold back. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, dense black fruit with a structured finish that does not quite deliver the complexity the aromatics suggest at first, but with aeration, manifests subtle nuances and fine mineralité. This is a great success for winemaker Frédéric Barnier and his team.",,RP (87-89)
1078,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Maison Louis Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières from Louis Jadot has a vibrant and energetic bouquet with just a touch of reduction, though it blows off to reveal a compelling bouquet with lovely mineral, granitic scents. The palate is crisp and fresh, well balanced with impressive power and intensity without compromising the tension and race. There is clearly fine length here. This is a Puligny-Montrachet with grand ambition. Yes, it's still a little oaky and more modern in style, but I have faith.",,RP (87-89)
1079,Louis Jadot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru Les Demoiselles (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chevalier Montrachet Les Demoiselles Grand Cru from Louis Jadot has a slightly touch of reduction, but it merely enhances the bouquet that delivers pure beeswax, jasmine and honeysuckle aromas, just a hint of brioche that emerges with time. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry with very well judged acidity. There is a lot of weight here, very focused and intense, a bolder and more extravagant Chevalier-Montrachet than Philippe Colin's Chevalier-Montrachet. This is a grand cru that needs time to be tamed.",,RP (87-89)
1080,Louis Jadot,Corton-Pougets Grand Cru (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Pougets Grand Cru from Louis Jadot has a dark and broody bouquet, and yet it is well defined with subtle marine notes filtering through with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, the acidity well judged leading to a structured, quite masculine, almost Pommard-like finish that has good sustain. This is a well crafted Corton with plenty of matière, though I would be inclined to leave it for three or four years.",,RP (87-89)
1081,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne (Duc de Magenta),"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Garenne from Louis Jadot has a very alluring nose, a little creamy oak to draw you in, seductive if not cerebral. The palate is balanced and poised with an irresistible creamy texture. Modern in style, a little oaky but there is substance underneath, yet it does not really articulate its origins as well as its peers. This is a bit underwhelming in the context of its exemplary showing from barrel. Perhaps it has closed down?",,RP (87-89)
1082,Louis Jadot,Chablis (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2014 Chablis, which is raised entirely in stainless steel, has a vibrant bouquet with subtle yellow flower scents underlying the mineral tones. This is more premier cru standard than village cru. The palate is fresh and taut, superbly focused and animated with just a touch of spiciness toward the long and sustained finish. This top-notch Chablis comes strongly recommended.",,RP (87-89)
1083,Louis Jadot,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses has a very sensual bouquet with orange-blossom, nectarine, jasmine and rosewater scents that are very well defined. Does it express Les Preuses? Not really, but that does not deny its attractiveness. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity. There is more tension here than La Chablisienne's Les Preuses blind tasted alongside, that spiciness surfacing toward the finish and leading you directly to this grand cru. This is very fine in context of the vintage.",,RP (87-89)
1084,Louis Jadot,Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume has a very composed and refined bouquet with Granny Smith apples, nettle and granitic scents that are very delineated and focused. The palate is balanced with ripe green apple and pear, the acidity lower than expected and as a consequence the finish is missing the tension of its peers. It started well before finishing in underwhelming fashion. Scores don't lie, especially when blind. So yes, I did score the Chablis 2014 higher.",,RP (87-89)
1085,Louis Jadot,Musigny Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Musigny Grand Cru has a glorious, complex bouquet with intense black cherries, wild strawberry, cold wet stone and orange blossom scents that really sprint out of the blocks. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin and supremely well-judged acidity. This is knitted together beautifully, and there is clearly more substance than the Amoureuses. With immense persistence in the mouth, this is a really top-notch Musigny.",,RP (87-89)
1086,Louis Jadot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has an inviting, warm and enveloping bouquet that seems to surround the senses and give them a big hug. The palate is well balanced with fine tannins, animated citrus fruit underlying the black cherries and wild strawberry notes. There is really quite wonderful precision and focus on the finish. This is one of Jadot's best 2013s.",,RP (87-89)
1087,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Chambertin Grand Cru has a sense of length and breadth on the nose: delve in to find red and yellow plum, wild strawberry, heather, forest floor and sage aromas that are well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, moderate weight in the mouth, but it is more a sense of focus and symmetry that really lifts this Chambertin. Fresh and vibrant with the mineral component becoming accentuated towards the linear finish, this is a Chambertin that will require several years in bottle.",,RP (87-89)
1088,Louis Jadot,Montrachet Grand Cru (Maison Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru, which comes from the Chassagne side, possesses a very precise bouquet that seems understated when compared to the more hedonistic Chevalier-Montrachet Les Demoiselles. This is much more demure, laid-back...nonchalant even. The palate is very precise - there is real detail here with delicate spicy notes furnishing the back end of this Montrachet that just expands toward the finish. I think this is keeping everything up its sleeve at the moment, but you cannot deny the balance and focus here.",,RP (87-89)
1089,Louis Jadot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Chambertin Clos-de-Beze Grand Cru has a touch more intensity on the nose when compared directly against the Chambertin '13. It is very well defined and the oak is seamlessly embroidered into the red and black brambly fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin: supple in the mouth with hints of marmalade and Asian spice toward the vibrant finish. Excellent, though the Chambertin has the edge in terms of sophistication.",,RP (87-89)
1090,Louis Jadot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses (Domaine Louis Jadot),"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru les Amoureuses has a very elegant, persuasive bouquet that exudes the essence of Pinote. There is great transparency here, a slightly lighter style of Amoureuses with red cherries, strawberry and minerals. The palate is medium-bodied with very lithe tannin that belie the structure underneath. Sure, there is some new oak poking through on the finish, but given several years in bottle, this should be a very fine Amoureuses.",,RP (87-89)
1091,Louis Jadot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières (Domaine des Héritiers Jadot),"The Heritiers de Louis Jadot bottling of the 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatieres has an enticing bouquet with orange zest, quince and fresh strawberries that frankly you could sit and nose all day! It's just gorgeous. The palate is very well balanced with a keen thread of acidity that is necessary to counterbalance the intense lightly honeyed, vivacious citric fruit that fans out wonderfully on the bravura of a finish. This is one of my top picks for Jadot this year and it is not to be missed.",,RP (87-89)
1092,Louis Jadot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru (Domaine Gagey),"The 2013 Clos Saint Denis Grand Cru has a slightly lighter color than the Clos de la Roche. The bouquet is certainly in the red fruit spectrum, with fresh strawberry, red currant and cranberry notes. There is an appealing sense of transparency here. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, lighter than I expected but very focused and with fine tension. I was just anticipating more substance on the finish like the Clos de la Roche. Still, I appreciate this style of Clos Saint Denis that does not press down on the accelerator too hard.",,RP (87-89)
1093,Poggio di Sotto,Pluribus,"The 2006 Pluribus, like all of these Cabernet Sauvignons, is youthful, with an opaque purple color and a big, sweet nose of blueberry liqueur intermixed with spring flowers and wet rocks. Full-bodied, powerful, and backward, with sweet tannin but formidable structure, this wine needs to be cellared for 4-5 years and drunk over the following 25 years.  

To reiterate what I have written in the past, Bond is the world-class project of Harlan Estates owner Bill Harlan. It is a simple concept—take 20+-year leases on some of the finest vineyard sites in all of Napa Valley, bring in your own winemaker (the well-known Bob Levy, along with Michel Rolland in the background) and produce these single-vineyard wines, with the stuff considered not good enough culled out and blended together into their second wine, called Matriarch. All of these wines are aged for nearly two years in 100% new French oak and bottled with no fining or filtration. They are all meant for 25 or even possibly 35+ years of aging. There are now five separate vineyards in the Bond portfolio. Quella comes from a 10-acre vineyard in Spring Valley near Howell Mountain, planted on volcanic white ash called tufa. The St. Eden comes from a valley floor vineyard in the Oakville corridor. Melbury is from Pritchard Hill, overlooking Lake Hennessy; Vecina is an east-facing hillside neighbor to Harlan Estate; and Pluribus is a Spring Mountain vineyard overlooking St. Helena.

1094,Poggio di Sotto,St. Eden,"From the valley floor vineyard in Oakville, the 2006 St. Eden has shed some of its tannic clout of last year and taken on a generously endowed style, with stunning black fruits, roasted herbs, sweet cassis, graphite and new oak. Fleshy and even opulent (an anomaly for a 2006), this is an impressively endowed Cabernet Sauvignon to drink over the next 25 years.  

To reiterate what I have written in the past, Bond is the world-class project of Harlan Estates owner Bill Harlan. It is a simple concept—take 20+-year leases on some of the finest vineyard sites in all of Napa Valley, bring in your own winemaker (the well-known Bob Levy, along with Michel Rolland in the background) and produce these single-vineyard wines, with the stuff considered not good enough culled out and blended together into their second wine, called Matriarch. All of these wines are aged for nearly two years in 100% new French oak and bottled with no fining or filtration. They are all meant for 25 or even possibly 35+ years of aging. There are now five separate vineyards in the Bond portfolio. Quella comes from a 10-acre vineyard in Spring Valley near Howell Mountain, planted on volcanic white ash called tufa. The St. Eden comes from a valley floor vineyard in the Oakville corridor. Melbury is from Pritchard Hill, overlooking Lake Hennessy, Vecina a east-facing hillside neighbor to Harlan Estate, and Pluribus a Spring Mountain vineyard overlooking St. Helena. The 2006s, which seemed tannic and unevolved last year, have put on weight, elegance, and for the most part, showed in the upper point ranges I gave them last year from barrel.",,RP 94
1095,Poggio di Sotto,Quella,"The newest entry into these single-vineyard wines (which are virtually all 100% Cabernet Sauvignon) is the 2006 Quella. Dense purple, this wine comes across as the most austere of any of these wines. This dense, rich, elegant wine displays impressive notes of espresso roast intermixed with blackberry and floral-infused blue fruits, but in the finish the tannins kick in, and the wine seems closed and in need of considerable aging. I would sit on this for a good half dozen years, and drink it over the following two decades.

1096,Poggio di Sotto,Matriarch,"Starting with the 2006 Matriarch, this wine is the easiest to drink young. With dark plum/purple, with plenty of smoke, blackcurrants, espresso roast, oak and chocolate, it is dense, round and best drunk over the next decade.

1097,Poggio di Sotto,Matriarch,"Bob Levy refers to the Matriarch proprietary red wine as “our elegant leftovers,” a four vineyard blend of juice that did not make the cut for the top wines. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful effort. Sweet black cherry and cedarwood aromas emerge from the medium-bodied 2002 Matriarch. With a soft, supple texture and an evolved, upfront style, it is ideal for drinking over the next decade. Restaurants as well as consumers who are incapable of deferring their gratification should buy this one by the case. 

This is the newest brainchild of the irrepressible Bill Harlan and his sensational winemaking team of Bob Levy and Michel Rolland. These are all 100% terroir-based Cabernet Sauvignons from distinctive sites in Napa Valley. There are 600-700 cases of each cuvee. The Melbury represents a hillside vineyard site above Lake Hennessy, the St. Eden is a valley floor vineyard in the Oakville corridor, and Vecina is a western hillside vineyard adjacent to Harlan Estate. I also tasted a stunning wine from Spring Mountain, which may be the next site that Bill Harlan offers to Bond’s mailing list clients. The quality of these singular, extraordinary offerings is world-class.",,RP 94
1098,Poggio di Sotto,Matriarch,"A great introduction to Bond’s style is the 2001 Matriarch, which Bob Levy calls, “our elegant leftovers.” This is a three-vineyard blend of the juice that was not rich or concentrated enough to be included in the single vineyard bottlings. Beautifully made, with wonderfully sweet notes of smoke, lead pencil shavings, black cherries, and cassis, an opulent texture, impressive concentration, low acidity, and silky tannin, it possesses more up-front charm and accessibility than its bigger siblings. Enjoy it over the next 10-12 years.

1099,Poggio di Sotto,Vecina,"The dense ruby/purple-colored 2000 Vecina offers up aromas of loamy earth, black fruits, chocolate, and toasty wood. I would not call it superficial, but it is no match for its younger sibling. Medium-bodied, with beautiful fruit, excellent purity, and a long, complex finish, it will drink well for 10-13 years.

While outstanding, unlike the profound 2001, it needs to be drunk during its first 10-12 years of life.

This is a second wine in name only. The 2000 Matriarch exhibits notes of dried Provencal herbs, roasted espresso, truffles, tar, meat, berries and blackcurrants. While attractive, it has less flavor dimension and volume than its younger sibling.",,RP 94

The complex 1999 Matriarch displays a deep plum/purple color along with sweet, succulent aromas of smoky oak, lead pencil shavings, and a sexy concoction of chocolate, blackcurrants, and licorice.

1104,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"Although this wine was very shy initially, the Poggio di Sotto 2019 Brunello di Montalcino eventually hits all the high notes of Sangiovese. This is a wine of enormous inner tension, showing a punchy, lifted personality with aromas of cherry skin and blackberry. You get brandied cherry, strawberry glazed pie with the gelatin, underbrush, blue flower, forget-me-nots, balsam herb, mint and licorice. A few hours later, the wine had developed into a classic beauty with slender lines, firm structure and a sparkle of brilliant acidity. The oak is integrated to the point of invisibility, the tannins are elegant and fine and the acidity is that proverbial cherry on top. Ultimately, I liked this village bottling more than the 2018 Riserva.",,RP 98+
1105,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"The Poggio di Sotto 2018 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva was reticent when I tasted it, probably owing to a period of awkwardness for such a young sample. The immediate suggestion is to give this bottle more time because, tasted now, it was definitely poured before its prime. The bouquet starts off with austere aromas of oil painting or waxed antiques, but those blow off. After that, you get an exciting compilation of redcurrant, cherry skin, rose petal and floral potpourri. This wine is very sprightly on the palate with fresh berry crush, integrated acidity and fine, chalky tannins. Again, this wine needs more time in bottle.",,RP 98+
1106,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"Poggio di Sotto hits it out the ballpark once again with an extremely elegant interpretation that shows the incredible depth and nuance Sangiovese can achieve, even in an uneven vintage such as this. The certified organic 2018 Brunello di Montalcino reveals a dark ruby hue and mid-weight concentration. Indeed, the wine is lighter and brighter than most, despite Brunello's mandatory five years of aging before its commercial release. The tannins are silky and melt over the palate. Along the way, the wine offers high notes of red cherry, cassis and blue flower. This 38,000-bottle release carries a very high price tag, but your high expectations will be met.",,RP 98+
1107,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Rosso di Montalcino,"This wine has more in common with a Brunello than it does a Rosso. Made with certified-organic fruit, Poggio di Sotto's 2018 Rosso di Montalcino is a very fine and smooth expression that caresses the senses. The bouquet is enlivened by forest berry, peat moss, lilac and wildflowers. The 2018 vintage is usually understated in personality, but this wine speaks of elegance and nuance. It's just stunning.",,RP 98+
1108,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"Made with certified-organic fruit, the 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is an impossibly graceful wine from a challenging vintage. This bottle defies the odds—and the dry heat of the growing season—to reveal soft layers of cherry, cassis and more vibrant fruit. It glides clear over the palate with silky momentum, and you only notice the tannins at the very end. Even those should soften and integrate as this collectible wine continues it bottle evolution. Production is 19,000 bottles.",,RP 98+
1109,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva is a stunning wine and an archetype of classic Sangiovese from Montalcino. I could drink this wine all day if it weren't so expensive. This Riserva is extremely fine and nuanced with the thinnest of fibers that wash over the palate like fine silk. Certified-organic fruit shapes aromas of cassis, cranberry, peony, tea leaf, orange and rusty nail. The aromas are tight and contained, yet they become increasingly expansive and expressive as the wine opens in the glass. It has contained power and, most importantly, a relatively moderate 14% alcohol, which makes all the difference in terms of balance and elegance. 8,000 bottles were made.",,RP 98+
1110,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"The beautiful 2016 Brunello di Montalcino possesses deep inner shine and a glossy nature that transcends the bouquet and the mouthfeel. The wine is redolent of dark plum and wild cherry, and those bright primary fruit tones descend into softer layers of rose hip and lavender sachet. The wine's acidity hits the palate with balanced determination and instantly livens up the senses. This classic vintage will be remembered for its length and pedigree.",,RP 98+
1111,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"The Poggio di Sotto 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva shows extra muscle definition, power and heady layers of rich fruit. This is all in line with the personality of the vintage, which was sunny and warm with golden sunlight throughout the summer season. This wine stands out for its fine-gained texture, which is smooth and polished. This Riserva offers aromas of cherry and blackberry and shows the depth that you should expect of a classic Riserva bottling.",,RP 98+
1112,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Rosso di Montalcino,"The Poggio di Sotto 2017 Rosso di Montalcino is a terrific wine and one of a handful of Rossi that I can recommend for longer cellar aging. This Rosso is built like a Brunello and shows the qualities needed to further its evolution. In this 20,000-bottle release, those attributes include complexity, freshness and a solid, mid-weight structure. You hardly feel the heat of the vintage, save for those hints of extra richness and concentration that add to the wine's important and pleasurable mouthfeel. This is a terrific Rosso with the long-term perspective of its big brother Brunello.",,RP 98+
1113,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"Poggio di Sotto doesn't miss a beat with this very special release. This is a glorious expression of the vintage, and the wine has absorbed the golden sunlight of Tuscany, delivering beautifully ripe, round and subtle fruit layers. The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows concentration, but not too much, and richness, but not too much. You get the power and the opulence of the vintage presented with the elegance and grace that is the house style at this venerated estate. Poggio di Sotto is one of the benchmarks of Montalcino, and the winery team continues the tradition with this 22,000-bottle release. There's a lot of red fruit energy deep inside that should stir this wine on course as it ages over the next two decades.",,RP 98+
1114,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Rosso di Montalcino,"The 2016 Rosso di Montalcino (with 18,000 bottles made) is a beautiful wine that could certainly rival full-fledged Brunello from some of the best estates in the appellation. This is especially true in the case of this vintage that over performs from all points of view. Poggio di Sotto makes a concerted effort to promote its Rosso as a stand-alone wine, and not as a little sister or Brunello inferior. Specific investments have been made to differentiate the Rosso program, and well, you might notice the expensive price point. Is the wine worth it? You can purchase some of Montalcino’s best Brunellos for less than this. However, there is a unique level of primary fruit intensity here with bold fruit aromas of cassis and wild raspberry that you would never get in a wine that ages as long as Brunello does. This is a fresh and forward wine that delivers impressive complexity and depth. The context is young fruit, not evolved fruit. In a sense, this wine embodies the true philosophy of Rosso di Montalcino more than any of its peers. The wine is not less important than Brunello, but it does strive to display Sangiovese at a different moment in its lifeline.",,RP 98+
1115,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"I suppose I could see myself spending $100 for the current (2016) release of Poggio di Sotto’s Rosso di Montalcino, but I don’t foresee paying $300 for the 2014 Brunello di Montalcino. With a mere 4,000 bottles produced, this is a beautiful wine—there’s no doubting its quality. This is an elegant, albeit somewhat undertone, Brunello from a cool and slow vintage that did develop pretty aromas, but did little to create age-worthy structure or power. Overall, this is a near-term vintage to enjoy in a time frame that overlaps with the 2016 Rosso di Montalcino in my opinion. This Brunello offers dried cherry aromas followed by flint, crushed mineral and scorched earth.",,RP 98+
1116,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"Poggio di Sotto reaches lofty new heights with the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva. I spent a lot of time studying this wine and I tasted it at different intervals and from different bottles. Fruit ripened slowly over a long period of time over the course of this cool vintage, resulting in bright acidity and a firm tannic backbone. This wine follows the classic promise of traditional Brunello that, above all, softens and improves with age. This wine will meet those important goals. The bouquet offers evolved tones of dried cherry and crème de cassis with lovely spice, tar, licorice and balsam herb that culminate in increased complexity and persistence. I also taste some of the sharpness of the vintage, although it should subside with time. That point of tannic thorniness (that I associate with 2013) is the only thing preventing this wine from scoring even higher. Only 2,700 bottles were produced.",,RP 98+
1117,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Rosso di Montalcino,"It has been too long since I last tasted the Rosso made by Poggio di Sotto, so I was very happy to include this sample in my flight. The 2015 Rosso di Montalcino opens to a mild garnet color and light appearance. The bouquet is very polished and precise. It offers clean aromas of wild berry and rose hip with some bitter almond and blue violets. To me, this wine delivers on all the expectations of this lower-tier category. The wine imparts beautiful Sangiovese purity with a bright, streamlined and informal personality. This is a lovely, lovely Rosso.",,RP 98+
1118,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"The 2013 Brunello di Montalcino is downright gorgeous. The wine is inward-looking at the very beginning, but it quickly revs up to deliver soaring intensity and profound elegance. It goes from first to sixth gear in seconds and grabs all your attention and admiration in the process. The bouquet reads like a textbook Sangiovese, with wild berry, rose hip, pressed violets, cola, balsam herb, licorice and cigar ash. The bouquet underlines the wine's enormous finesse and pedigree, but the mouthfeel is all about frankness, directness and power. This is a naked and pure Brunello that glows bright with confidence and pride.",,RP 98+
1119,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"Poggio di Sotto continues to impress with this stunning new vintage of its top-shelf wine. The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva shows volume and power; meanwhile, it brushes past the senses with the delicate flutter of a butterfly. The bouquet is infused with floral tones of red rose and lavender with fruity elements of cassis and wild cherry. You feel the warmth of the vintage specifically on the palate, where the weight and the density of the wine is more evident. There is a point of distinctive sweetness that lasts just for a moment, but that is a reoccurring theme in the 2012 Brunellos, generally speaking.",,RP 98+
1120,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"Poggio di Sotto has solidified its reputation as a top estate in the appellation. Mr. Claudia Tipa, the current owner, made a fantastic acquisition when he purchased this gem not too long ago. The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino does the denomination proud with a very special and unique set of aromatic characteristics. It's hard to wrap your head around the wine's complexity when you first approach the glass. I'm going to throw out a lot of descriptors that resonated with me including wild berry, underbrush, eucalyptus, dried ginger, cola, tobacco and cured meat. I'm a huge fan of those balsam-like nuances. The wine opens to medium consistency with luminous ruby-colored highlights. The mouthfeel is as smooth as silk sheets. I love this wine but am definitely less enamored by the steep price point.",,RP 98+
1121,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"This wine floored me. The 2011 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva is a stunning beauty and a wine well worth the attention (if you can afford its lofty pricing aspirations). Thankfully, the beauty of the contents will help alleviate some of the sticker shock. This is a supple and silky expression with an infinite array of Sangiovese-based aromas. You'll recognize wild cassis, forest floor, autumnal leaf, button mushroom, grilled herb, rosemary, balsam herb and red rose petal. The effect is fragrant and delicate. The mouthfeel is equally ethereal and nuanced. With only 3,500 bottles made, not many of us will have the luxury of trying this beautiful wine. And, that is really too bad.",,RP 98+
1122,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino,"The 2011 Brunello di Montalcino offers an immediate sense of generosity and openness that makes it attractive on first impact. In this regard, 2011 is very different from the slow-to-reveal-itself 2010 vintage that proceeds it. Bold tones of dark cherry, plum, spice and resin rise to the top with enthusiasm and intensity. The wine holds back nothing. It shows a velvety texture that is rich and enduring. All the while, this Brunello remains faithful to its time honored traditions and its territorial roots. ",,RP 98+
1123,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,"Poggio di Sotto has released one of the wines of the vintage. The 2010 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva fulfills the promise of its category. Brunello Riservas are aged for six long years before their release, thus insuring extra intensity and complexity. This wine delivers both in abundance. The bouquet is more sophisticated and deeper than the Annata and in addition to dark fruit and blackberry, this wine shows an extra dose of clove and spice. In the mouth, the wine is smooth and silky, but it also shows impressive power and length. This Riserva will deliver its best performance for those who are willing to wait ten years or more.

Wafting from the glass with aromas of white peach, confit citrus, drawn butter, almond paste and flowers, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a generous core of fruit underpinned by lively acids. If you're holding this, there's really no reason to wait.",,RP (95-97)
1125,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"From one of the first vintages bottled at the domaine, Lafon's 1934 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes offers up aromas of hazelnut butter, confit orange, Parmesan cheese rind and hints of oatmeal, followed by a medium to full-bodied, deep and textural palate structured around prodigious levels of dry extract that confers serious tannic heft to this muscular, bone dry and profoundly complex white Burgundy.",,RP (95-97)
1126,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"One of the best wines I've tasted from this era of Dominique Lafon's career, the 1992 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières offers up a deep bouquet of ripe orchard fruits, mirabelle plums, honeycomb, white flowers, pastry cream and frangipane, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and seamless palate that's fleshy and enveloping, with vibrant acids and a long, nicely defined finish. It's fully mature, so I'd be inclined to drink up.",,RP (95-97)

1143,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"Lafon's 2008 Meursault Clos de la Barre is fully mature and drinking quite well today, offering up aromas of buttered orchard fruit, citrus oil, toasty oak and hints of exotic fruits that emerge with time in the glass. Medium to full-bodied, it's delicately textural, with a pretty core of fruit, tangy acids that are a touch assertive and a penetrating, sulfate-inflected finish.",,RP (95-97)
1144,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Soaring from the glass with aromas of buttered orchard fruit, honeycomb, orange oil, peach and nutmeg, the 2020 Montrachet Grand Cru is full-bodied, rich and satiny, with a layered, muscular mid-palate that's girdled by lively acids and a long, resonant finish. This is an expressive, dramatic Montrachet that can comfortably keep company with the superb 2017, 2018 and 2019 vintages.",,RP (95-97)
1145,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2020 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is brilliant, offering up a complex bouquet of pear, crisp stone fruits, clear honey, baking spices, wheat toast and hazelnuts. Medium to full-bodied, deep and taut, it's extremely concentrated, with racy acids and an abundance of chalky structuring extract. This site has really excelled this year.",,RP (95-97)
1146,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Lafon's 2022 Montrachet Grand Cru is brilliant, wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, orange oil, white flowers, toasted nuts, honeycomb and nutmeg, followed by a full-bodied, rich and layered palate that's concentrated and suave, with lively animating acids and a long, penetrating finish.",,RP (95-97)
1147,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2022 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is brilliant, offering up aromas of crisp yellow orchard fruit mingled with notions of apple blossom, buttery pastry, freshly baked bread and honeycomb. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's structured and multidimensional, with impressive reserves of chalky extract and a long, palate-staining finish. Of Lafon's ""big three"" in Meursault, it's often Les Charmes that ages the best over the very long term, and I could certainly see that being the case in this vintage.",,RP (95-97)
1148,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2022 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is seamless and suave, wafting from the glass with notes of white flowers, sweet yellow orchard fruit, orange zest, citrus blossom and buttery pastry.

1150,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The domaine's most serious red is the 2022 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu, a medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy wine redolent of cherries, wild berries, peonies and spices. Layered and concentrated, it's built around lively acids and sweet, powdery tannins.",,RP (95-97)
1151,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of pear and orange oil mingled with white flowers, apple blossom and freshly baked bread, Lafon's 2022 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a textural attack that segues into a layered and lively palate, concluding with good grip on the finish.",,RP (95-97)
1152,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 1982 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières is fully mature and some bottles are beginning to fray around the edges, but this example was fabulous, bursting with aromas of ripe orchard fruit, peach, orange oil, buttered toast, oatmeal and honeycomb. Full-bodied, ample and textural, it's sumptuous and satiny, with lively girdling acids and chalky structuring extract underpinning its lavish core of fruit. I'd be inclined to drink up.",,RP (91-93)
1153,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"One of my favorite bottlings chez Lafon in this era, the 1982 Meursault Désirée is demonstrative and exotic, bursting with aromas of peaches, orchard fruit, confit citrus honeycomb, marzipan and praline. Medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with a deep and layered core as well as impressive structure and cut for such an exuberant wine, I suspect it has drunk superbly since release. Fully mature, now is a good time to drink up.",,RP (91-93)
1154,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"It had been some time since I last tasted René Lafon's fabulous 1980 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or, and it has lost nothing with the passing of the years. Offering up inviting aromas of pear, apricot, drawn butter, toasted almonds, smoke, iodine and clear honey, it's medium to full-bodied, textural and enveloping, with lively acids and chalky grip underpinning its generous core of fruit. Seamless and complete, this beautiful bottle exemplifies Burgundy's capacity to surprise, no matter what the vintage conditions are on paper.",,RP (91-93)
1155,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"The 1980 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes opens in the glass with sweet aromas of berries, spices, woodsmoke, orange rind and beetroot. Medium to full-bodied, with lively acids, an ample core of fruit and fine, chalky tannins, it gains volume in the glass, fleshing out to become more complete.",,RP (91-93)
1156,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Like the Clos de la Barre, Lafon's 1980 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is still rather austere. Opening in the glass with scents of apricot, buttered toast, iodine and beeswax, it's medium to full-bodied, firm and tightly wound, with chalky structuring dry extract that lends some asperity to the finish. This isn't going into decline any time soon, but it will never display the plenitude of a great vintage.",,RP (91-93)
1157,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"The 1980 Meursault Clos de la Barre unwinds in the glass with aromas of drawn butter, clear honey, fresh field mushroom, orange rind and smoke. Medium to full-bodied, it's satiny but chiseled, with tangy acids and chalky structuring extract that asserts itself on the grippy finish. In profile this has more in common with Lafon's 1980 Meursault Charmes, which was also a little austere, than with the more generous and enveloping Goutte d'Or.",,RP (91-93)
1158,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Unwinding in the glass with notes of pear, citrus oil, mandarin orange, ripe peaches, freshly baked bread and clear honey, Lafon's 2019 Montrachet Grand Cru is full-bodied, elegantly muscular and layered, with a deep and prodigiously concentrated core, striking mid-palate amplitude and a long, lip-smacking finish. In any comparison between the triumvirate of 2017, 2018, and 2019, I can see this, the youngest of the three, taking first place a decade from now.",,RP (91-93)
1159,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is very promising indeed, wafting from the glass with notes of citrus zest, buttered orchard fruit, toasted almonds, honeycomb and mandarin.

This is very promising.",,RP (91-93)
1162,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Mingling aromas of pear, green apple and citrus oil with hints of white flowers and toasted nuts, the 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or is medium to full-bodied, satiny and precise, with a deep and concentrated core girdled by bright acids and underpinned by chalky dry extract. Long and penetrating, this is promising.",,RP (91-93)
1163,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"Aromas of pear, orange peel, honeycomb, toasted almonds and white flowers introduce Lafon's 2019 Meursault Clos de la Barre, a medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping wine with fine concentration, chalky structuring extract and lively acids. While its depth of fruit may lend it deceptive youthful charm, it's built to age.",,RP (91-93)
1164,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots opens in the glass with notes of citrus oil, almond paste, white flowers and vanilla pod.

As is often the case, this is a refined middleweight.",,RP (91-93)
1169,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay Village,"Deriving, as usual, from young vines in Les Santenots, the 2019 Volnay Village reveals aromas of cherries and sweet berries, complemented by hints of peony and loamy soil.

1170,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"The 2019 Meursault Village opens in the glass with notes of honeyed pears, white flowers and peach, complemented by hints of buttered toast and praline.

This has turned out especially well.",,RP (91-93)
1172,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Baronne,"Offering up aromas of confit citrus, pear and almond paste, the 2019 Meursault Clos de la Baronne is medium-bodied, round and fleshy, retaining good precision despite this site's proclivity to voluptuousness. As usual, some of the 2018 Meursault Clos de la Baronne will be bottled separately for the US market and the rest blended into the domaine's regular Meursault.",,RP (91-93)
1173,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"Offering up aromas of drawn butter, confit lemon, oak vanillin and fino sherry, the 2007 Meursault Clos de la Barre is medium-bodied, tangy and compact, combining angular acids with over-evolved characteristics. This bottle, which had never left Burgundy, was a notable disappointment.",,RP (91-93)
1174,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"There are fully seven barrels of the 2018 Montrachet Grand Cru—one fewer than the eight produced in 1982, but considerably more than the four that have been more or less the norm over the last decade—equating to a yield of around 45 hectoliters per hectare from Lafon's 0.32-hectare parcel. Bursting with expressive aromas of orange oil, white flowers, ripe pears, warm bread and toasted almonds, it's full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a satiny-textured attack, an ample core of fruit and chalky grip on the impressively long finish.",,RP (91-93)
1175,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is also showing very well, revealing aromas of pear, crisp yellow orchard fruit, fresh peach, almond paste and white flowers, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and muscular palate that's deep, concentrated and structured, with more texture and a more introverted profile than the more expressive Genevrières. This is another great bottle in the making.",,RP (91-93)
1176,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is a great success, unfurling in the glass with aromas of fresh pear, blanched almonds, orange oil, white flowers, nutmeg and pastry cream.

Tasted from barrel side by side with the 2017 Perrières from bottle, the 2018 isn't as textural, and its bouquet doesn't display the musky aromatic top notes that mark the 2017—but it promises to be every bit as compelling.",,RP (91-93)
1178,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Lafon's finest red this year is, as usual, the 2018 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu, a wine that combines the finesse of the Clos des Chênes with the power and depth of the Champans.

1179,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"As usual, the 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or, which derives from clay-rich soils, makes for quite a contrast after the Bouchères, where the soils are richer in active calcium. Unwinding to reveal aromas of citrus oil, fresh peach, white flowers and a deft touch of minty new oak, the wine is medium to full-bodied, muscular and incisive, with a deeper and more structured profile than the ethereal Bouchères.",,RP (91-93)
1180,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots is also very lively and nicely defined this year, displaying scents of pear, lemon oil, crisp green apple, white flowers and a subtle touch of oak vanillin.

This is the raciest, most structured and most serious of the domaine's communal-level bottlings, and it will be well worth seeking out.",,RP (91-93)
1182,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"Exhibiting aromas of cassis, rich soil tones and smoky blackberries, the richest, most muscular red in the cellar is the 2018 Volnay 1er Cru Champans, a medium to full-bodied, ripe and powerful wine with a fleshy core of fruit and a long, heady finish.",,RP (91-93)
1183,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Aromas of pears, marzipan, white flowers and spices introduce the 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères, a medium to full-bodied, succulent and lively wine that's elegant and fine-boned. This is a pretty, precise Bouchères that should offer a broad drinking window.",,RP (91-93)
1184,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"The 2018 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes is elegant this year, wafting from the glass with aromas of cassis, dark berries, orange rind and a deft framing of new oak.

1185,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"There are fully 68 barrels of the 2018 Meursault Village this year, a considerable improvement over the usual 50, and the wine is already very inviting, revealing notes of pear, Meyer lemon, hazelnuts, drawn butter and white flowers.

1186,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"A ripe bouquet of honeyed peaches, pears, beeswax, toasted almonds and white flowers introduces the 2018 Meursault Désirée, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping wine that's ripe, textural and sumptuous, with succulent acids and a long finish. While the Désirée always has huge upfront appeal, it is often also deceptively age-worthy.",,RP (91-93)
1187,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Baronne,"As usual, some of the 2018 Meursault Clos de la Baronne will be bottled separately for the US market and the rest blended into the domaine's regular Meursault.

As is quite often the case, I have a preference for this Charmes over Lafon's Perrières this year, though it will be interesting to put that contention to the test a decade from now.",,RP (91-93)
1191,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières is performing well from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of orange blossom, citrus zest, pear, almond paste and freshly baked bread. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and elegant, with a textural and enveloping attack, a ripe core of fruit, lively balancing acids and a precise, nicely defined finish. This is a lively but expressive young Perrières that will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP (91-93)
1192,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu confirms its strong showing from barrel, soaring from the glass with scents of ripe cherries, red berries, rose petals, orange rind and a deft touch of toasty new oak. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with melting tannins, succulent acids and a charming, supple profile that makes it hard to resist.",,RP (91-93)
1193,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Montrachet Grand Cru is a classic in the making, wafting from the glass with aromas of lemon oil, citrus blossom, green apple, mandarin and beeswax, subtly framed by new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, beautifully complete and multidimensional, with a broad, satiny attack, a deep, layered mid-palate and a pure, penetrating finish. Youthfully reserved today, its almost understated elegance conceals impressive reserved of structure and extract.",,RP (91-93)
1194,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières wafts from the glass with aromas of pear, ripe lemons, wheat toast, hazelnut and white flowers.

1195,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Offering up aromas of buttered apples, pear, praline and beeswax, the 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or is medium to full-bodied, broad-shouldered and reserved, with impressive power and chalky extract, balanced by succulent acids. It's one of the more backward wines in the Lafon cellar this year.",,RP (91-93)
1196,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"The 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Champans is effectively an old vine cuvée, as the parcel planted in 1922 gave a sufficiently generous crop for Dominique Lafon to relegate most of the fruit from the domaine's 1989 planting to the Volnay Village. The resulting wine is excellent, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark chocolate, dried flowers and candied peel. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and layered, with more concentration than the Clos des Chênes, and more length on the finish, too. I'm looking forward to seeing it from bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1197,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots exhibits aromas of green orchard fruit, dried white flowers and toasted nuts, framed by a touch of toasty new oak.

1199,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"The 2017 Meursault Désirée wafts from the glass with appealing aromas of ripe lemons, orange blossom, pastry cream and beeswax. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and gourmand, underpinned by succulent but ripe acids. This younger vine cuvée—the parcel was replanted in 2007-2008 and made its comeback with the 2012 vintage—hasn't yet attained the fleshy amplitude that used to distinguish it, but it makes progress every year. It hails from a warm site near Santenots, just below Meursault's campground.",,RP (90-92)
1200,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Baronne,"Seven barrels of the 2017 Meursault Clos de la Baronne will be bottled exclusively for the US market, with the result of the production blended into the Meursault Village cuvée. The wine is charming and demonstrative, bursting with aromas of green orchard fruit, honeycomb and white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and succulent, with a mouthwateringly saline finish. This will be hard to resist out of the gates.",,RP (90-92)

1203,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay Village,"A cuvée composed of young vine Santenots and only comparatively young vine Champans, the 2017 Volnay Village is medium-bodied, elegant and open-knit, with good depth at the core, succulent acids and fine tannins, concluding with a respectably long finish.",,RP (90-92)
1204,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Les Duresses,"Aromas of red berries, forest floor and spices introduce the 2017 Monthélie Les Duresses, a medium-bodied, succulent wine framed by melting but chalky tannins.",,RP (90-92)
1205,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes is superb, unfurling in the glass with aromas of crisp peaches, apples, dried white flowers, honeycomb and oatmeal. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and pure, with a deep, concentrated and multidimensional core, vibrant acids and a long finish. There's plenty of tight-knit structure and dry extract here, so this should be a long-lived Charmes.",,RP (90-92)
1206,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Aromas of dark cherries, incense, baking chocolate and rich soil tones introduce the 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu, a medium to full-bodied wine with superb depth and dimension, juicy balancing acids and powdery structuring tannins. The finish is long and sapid. It's an excellent Santenots that has really fleshed out since I tasted it from barrel.",,RP (90-92)
1207,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"The 2016 Meursault Clos de la Barre opens in the glass with aromas of musky peach, iodine, mandarin orange and smoky citrus oil. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with a textural attack, juicy acids and an expansive, saline finish. The impact of the frost seems to have made for more than usually heterogeneous maturity, and that lends the wine a rather old-fashioned profile. While I suspect it will never be a favorite of Dominique Lafon's, it's a commendable effort in a challenging vintage.",,RP (90-92)
1208,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, Lafon's 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru displays incredible potential, unfurling in the glass with a classy bouquet of buttered Meyer lemons, toasted nuts, dried white flowers and mandarin oil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, richly textural but tangy, with a deep, tight-knit core, excellent concentration and a long, pure finish. An hour later, this Montrachet was still filling out, acquiring more dimension along with subtly honeyed aromatic top notes, so I suspect my score will prove conservative.",,RP (90-92)
1209,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"From barrel, I preferred Lafon's 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes to his Perrières, and that preference manifested itself a year and a half later under blind conditions. Wafting from the glass with aromas of crisp peach, yellow orchard fruit, nutmeg and honey, it's a full-bodied, layered and multidimensional wine with terrific depth and concentration but rendered in a satiny, elegant style. Pure, precise and beautifully delineated, it was bottled under Diam 30.",,RP (90-92)
1210,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières reveals a nuanced bouquet of citrus oil, crisp yellow orchard fruit, nutmeg and white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a tensile, mineral profile. It isn't as profoundly multidimensional or satiny as Lafon's superb Charmes, but it's a classy and incipiently complex Perrières that ranks as one of the vintage's best.",,RP (90-92)
1211,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu offers up a deep bouquet of red-black cherries, spices, potpourri, espresso roast and subtle grilled meat. Full-bodied, ample and sappy on the palate, it's rich but vibrant, with fine-grained structuring tannins that are beginning to assert themselves on the finish. Having drunk several bottles of this wine since release, the extent to which it's shutting down is clearly apparent, and at this stage, patience will be required.",,RP (90-92)
1212,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind, Lafon's 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Genevrières exhibits a reserved nose of struck match, iodine and citrus oil, followed by a medium to full-bodied, taut but layered palate that's deep, tangy and concentrated but decidedly tight-knit at this stage. Some patience will be required.",,RP (90-92)
1213,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères exhibits a pretty bouquet of ripe citrus, pear, stone fruit pit and blanched almonds, followed by a medium to full-bodied, delicately textural palate that's bright, precise and decidedly elegant in profile.",,RP (90-92)
1214,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots reveals an attractive bouquet of green orchard fruit, white flowers and hazelnut cream. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, with a satiny attack, chewy extract and tangy balancing acids. It's a definite success.",,RP (90-92)
1215,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Thankfully, the 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrieres was a normal crop from Dominique Lafon, comprising ten and a half barrels. It has a vivid, hazelnut and flinty bouquet that is a little stricter than other years but very well focused. The palate is very composed with fine, lightly honeyed fruit, hazelnut and almond, leading to a very pretty and harmonious finish that lingers in the mouth. This is a very well-crafted, quintessential Genevrières that does its best to compensate for the devastation wrought in other vineyards.",,RP (90-92)
1216,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrieres manages to retain the stoniness, the sense of the earth that Perrières should convey—well defined, nicely focused with a subtle marmalade tang developing in the glass. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, gentle and refined, maybe not quite delivering the mineralité of the best vintages but certainly long and tender in the mouth. I think this has more to give, even if I doubt it will reach the heady heights of the 2014.",,RP (90-92)
1217,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Champans, the lower part of which was touched by frost, has a much more terroir-driven, mineral-led bouquet with black cherries, bergamot and cold stone scents. This feels more driven than the Clos des Chenes. The palate is well balanced with fine definition, tensile black cherry and blueberry fruit framing a pretty, tensile finish. This showed up the Clos des Chênes out of barrel, and it will be interesting to see whether it does likewise once in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1218,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"The 2016 Meursault Désirée was reduced to a single barrel. It has a well defined and quite tensile bouquet, with hints of hazelnut and smoke, gaining in intensity in the glass. The palate is well balanced, fresh and vibrant with a very fine line of acidity, hints of yellow plum, tangerine and sea salt on the long and persistent finish. Excellent. Such a pity there is bugger all of it.",,RP (90-92)
1219,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"The 2016 Meursault Goutte d’Or has impressive delineation on the nose, much more than the Meursault Boucheres, sporting better tension and vigor. The palate is quite tensile on the opening, less mellifluous than the Boucheres and demonstrating greater terroir expression. This is certainly showing more potential than other barrel samples from the domaine, though I would afford it a couple of years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1220,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes offers brisk ripe cranberry and blackberry scents on the nose—nicely defined even if not quite in the same class as the 2015. The palate is pretty rather than powerful. Ample red cherry and strawberry fruit with quite supple tannin, leading to a rounded, lightly grippy finish that maybe just misses the complexity and ambition of the Les Champans this year.",,RP (90-92)
1221,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"There are just five barrels instead of fifty of the 2016 Meursault Village this year. It has a simple, dried honey and walnut-scented bouquet that is just missing some tension that the 2014 and 2015 were bestowed. The palate is pretty—very smooth, with a gentle, caressing texture, tropical hints of passion fruit and guava on the entry and an attractive and easygoing finish.",,RP (90-92)
1222,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"There are just two and a half barrels of the 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Boucheres because of the frost this year. The nose was showing quite a bit of reduction when I tasted it from tank. The palate is much better, with a honeyed opening, hints of nutmeg and walnut infusing the light tropical tones with a tang of ginger on the finish. The reduction gets in the way a little, so hopefully this will come together in bottle. We will see.",,RP (90-92)
1223,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Les Duresses,"There are eight barrels of the 2016 Monthelie les Duresses this year. Tasted directly from stainless steel vat, fragrant crushed strawberry and red cherry fruit waft from the nose while the palate is fleshy and quite plump with a fine bead of acidity on the tart finish. There is often something straightforward and nonchalant about Dominique's Monthélie, and that is precisely what I like about it.",,RP (90-92)
1224,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"From one hectare came two and a half barrels of 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots this year. There was too much volatile acidity on the nose for me to really read the wine underneath, while the palate is quite rich and honeyed. There's moderate acidity on the palate, with nutmeg and walnut lining the spicy, assertive finish. I will reserve judgement for now because the aromatics need to settle.",,RP (90-92)
1225,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru from Domaine des Comtes Lafon has a clean and fresh bouquet, perhaps just a bit too much lime for my liking, although there is mineralité tucked in just behind. The palate is fresh and saline on the entry with a superb line of acidity. There is weight and presence to this Montrachet, and it gains weight and delivers a knockout, extremely persistent finish tinged with lemon thyme and sherbet. Though a little disjointed at present, I suspect this will turn into a wonderful Montrachet with style and class. But be warned that it will require several years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1226,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Lafon's 2014 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières has a clean and fresh bouquet with scents of dried honey, wet granite and apple blossom, just a hint of pralines tucked behind. This is very complex, very intellectual. The palate is fresh and crisp with vibrant acidity, quite saline in the mouth with an intense, marine-influenced finish, hints of oyster shell lingering on the aftertaste. Wow—this is a Meursault that delivers the goods.",,RP (90-92)
1227,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes from Comtes Lafon was not firing on all cylinders from barrel but clearly this is not the case now that the wine is in bottle. It demonstrated a subtle reduction on the nose with scents of dried quince complementing the citrus fruit, walnut and smoke aromas. The palate is well balanced with fine delineation, harmonious with notes of tangerine and orange zest, the oak nicely integrated with appreciable weight on the finish. Very fine, very sophisticated—this surpasses my expectations from barrel.",,RP (90-92)
1228,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Meursault 1er Cru les Genevrières was packed full of sulfur on the nose although behind this lies intense fruit that will blossom with two or three years in bottle (the longer the better). The palate is well balanced with slightly honeyed fruit, a fine thread of acidity and great presence on the finish. You cannot deny the substance and length of this 2014 from Dominique Lafon, a wine with ambition. All this Meursault requires is more time.",,RP (90-92)
1229,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu from Comtes Lafon is blessed with a sensual bouquet with plenty of dark cherry and blueberry fruit, maybe a slight malic scent just underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, a fine line of acidity, fresh and tensile with impressive mineralité coming through toward the finish. This is a stylish, well-crafted Santenots that should age well in bottle and may eventually merit a higher score. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (90-92)
1230,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Champans from Comtes Lafon has an endearing bouquet, one that is very harmonious: crushed strawberry and cranberry, fine mineralité and great delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with deftly chiseled tannin. This is very pure and refined, silky smooth in texture with a sensual, poised finish that lingers long in the mouth. What a gorgeous Volnay Champans from Dominique Lafon this is turning out to be! Tasted September 2017.",,RP (90-92)
1231,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots was very concentrated and intense on the nose, some SO2 to be addressed (like many of its peers) but underneath lies plenty of fruit with hints of passion fruit and grapefruit. The palate is very well balanced with crisp acidity that counters the rich, slightly honeyed fruit. This is a Meursault of stature and breadth and while not the most detailed, certainly packed full of flavor.",,RP (90-92)
1232,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes from Comtes Lafon has a gorgeous bouquet with ebullient red cherry and wild strawberry scents, wonderful mineralité, real cohesion and intent. There is a lot of gusto here. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, not exuding the complexity and nuance of the aromatics, quite primal and showing a little toughness toward the finish. This might be enduring an awkward phase, ergo the plus sign mark against my score. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (90-92)
1233,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchère, which Dominique Lafon bottled using Diam 30 closures, has a touch of oyster shell on the marine-influenced bouquet, a hint of orange blossom later. So far, so good. The palate is fresh on the entry with mandarin and grapefruit notes, though it seems to lose some of its initial complexity and then unexpectedly finishes in rather ordinary fashion. Perhaps it is just a matter of time?",,RP (90-92)
1234,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Montrachet Grand Cru has opened up since I last tasted a bottle (also blind) offering glimpses of honeysuckle and beeswax, even a hint of dried pineapple with time. It feels fresh, effervescent even. The palate is underpinned by a fine thread of acidity, and this time I did not detect any oxidative notes towards the finish, although it did come across as quite ""creamy"" with accentuated oakiness that suggests it deserves 3-4 more years to reach its plateau. As before, I remain cautious with my assessment. Tasted October 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1235,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Now here is a reminder that you should NEVER dismiss a wine by dint of its vintage. The 1984 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes from Comtes-Lafon ought to have been DOA. On the contrary, it offered wonderful aromatics: jasmine, honeysuckle, linden and hints of tangerine that defied all expectations. It set you up for a delicious palate, quite tensile yet elegant and focused. Hints of orange zest and mandarin line the finish that feels surprisingly long. Who knew how good this 32-year-old Meursault from a supposed written-off vintage could be? Tasted November 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1236,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Champans was picked on 1 September and the fruit was completely de-stemmed. It has a precocious bouquet with oodles of red cherry, kirsch and blueberry notes that are nicely controlled, seeming to gather momentum in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied, velvety smooth with sensual blueberry and strawberry fruit, a hint of orange sorbet and cherry liqueur on the finish. This is a gorgeous Volnay Champans and it would not surprise me if it ended up being Dominique Lafon's finest 2015, white or red.",,RP (90-92)
1237,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes, which includes 50% whole cluster this year after the fruit was picked on 31 August, will be matured in a maximum of one-third new oak. It has a fragrant raspberry and blackberry-scented bouquet with a touch of iodine. The palate is medium-bodied with lush tannin, a fine bead of acidity and very pure raspberry, wild strawberry and blueberry notes that flourish towards the generous finish. This is a fine Clos des Chênes, though surpassed by the Volnay Champans and Santenots this year.",,RP (90-92)
1238,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"The 2015 Meursault Désirée, which Dominique Lafon told me finished its malolactic just before harvest, has a precise, mineral, limestone-scented bouquet that is backward but very focused. The palate is clean and again, precise, edgy and tensile with a steely, green apple and kiwi fruit-tinged finish that is almost understated, but is very long in the mouth. You know, this might ultimately eclipse the 2014—it's that good.",,RP (90-92)
1239,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Baronne,"The 2015 Meursault Clos de la Baronne is named after the 2.4-hectare lieu-dit that was acquired back in 2010. Seven barrels were separated this year and sold exclusively to wine consultant/sommelier Robert Bohr, who spearheaded the American investment in the former René Manuel holdings. It has a fresh and vibrant bouquet with citrus fruit, touches of dried pineapple, mirabelle and almond. The palate is rounded with lightly honeyed fruit and comes across as easydrinking in style thanks to its harmony with subtle tropical notes of guava and fresh mango towards the finish. I can see how this would be lapped up by consumers seeking an introduction to Dominique Lafon's wines.",,RP (90-92)
1240,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"The 2015 Meursault Village has a lively, mint-tinged bouquet with just a touch of anise coming through as it opens in the glass. The palate is generous on the entry with citrus lemon, dried pineapple and a touch of honeycomb, gently unfolding in the glass with a persistent finish. Enjoy this over the next 6-10 years.",,RP (90-92)
1241,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Les Duresses,"The 2015 Monthélie Les Duresses has a lovely, frisky raspberry coulis and strawberry-scented bouquet with good intensity. The palate is fleshy and generous with a keen line of acidity, harmonious with a pleasant touch of piquancy on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
1242,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Dominique Lafon poured his 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or, however, it was clearly far too primal and reduced for me to make any evaluation. So I will seek to re-examine this once it is more evolved.",,RP (90-92)
1243,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Porusot has as a very terroir-driven nose: very Meursault with grilled walnut and hazelnut complementing the citrus fruit that feels razor-sharp. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, fresh and vibrant with satisfying depth and harmony. There is still some oak to be absorbed here, but it has wonderful focus and tension. This is a very delicious Meursault from Dominique Lafon. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1244,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Boucheres has a pleasant reduction on the nose, not to the extent that it occludes terroir, but certainly adopting the distinctive Coche-like style and just about getting away with it. The palate is slightly sour on the entry, however there is a keen line of acidity and the vibrant spicy finish maintains fine delineation and imparts length. I would just like it to dispense with a slight bitterness right on the finish. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1245,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes was perplexing. It had a rather unclean nose, smoke and walnut, but missing some of the clarity of its peers. The palate is slightly bitter on the entry, but it seems to get its act together for the second half, suddenly delivering more focus and tension on the citrus-driven finish. This was difficult to fathom out after such an impressive showing in barrel. I am not quite sure what is happening here so I will seek to re-taste. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1246,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"The 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Champans is effectively an old vine cuvée, as the parcel planted in 1922 gave a sufficiently generous crop for Dominique Lafon to relegate most of the fruit from the domaine's 1989 planting to the Volnay Village. The resulting wine is excellent, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark chocolate, dried flowers and candied peel. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and layered, with more concentration than the Clos des Chênes, and more length on the finish, too. I'm looking forward to seeing it from bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1247,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots exhibits aromas of green orchard fruit, dried white flowers and toasted nuts, framed by a touch of toasty new oak. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and saline, concluding with a pure finish.",,RP (90-92)
1248,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères reveals notes of citrus zest, peach, white flowers and almond paste on the nose, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny palate that's more tensile and incisive than last year's rendition, concluding with a saline finish.",,RP (90-92)
1249,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"The 2017 Meursault Désirée wafts from the glass with appealing aromas of ripe lemons, orange blossom, pastry cream and beeswax. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and gourmand, underpinned by succulent but ripe acids. This younger vine cuvée—the parcel was replanted in 2007-2008 and made its comeback with the 2012 vintage—hasn't yet attained the fleshy amplitude that used to distinguish it, but it makes progress every year. It hails from a warm site near Santenots, just below Meursault's campground.",,RP (90-92)
1250,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"Seven barrels of the 2017 Meursault Clos de la Baronne will be bottled exclusively for the US market, with the result of the production blended into the Meursault Village cuvée. The wine is charming and demonstrative, bursting with aromas of green orchard fruit, honeycomb and white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and succulent, with a mouthwateringly saline finish. This will be hard to resist out of the gates.",,RP 87?
1251,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"The 2014 Meursault Village, a blend of several vineyards, consists of 22 barrels rather than the usual 50 barrels. It has an understated bouquet, a little quiet at the moment though nicely defined. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with fine acidity, though it tapers slightly towards the finish. I feel that this was knocked sideways by the trauma of the hailstorm, a Meursault with its wings clipped and just doing the best that it can.",,RP 87?
1252,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"The 2014 Meursault Desirée 1er Cru has a lifted, fresh pear, green apple and quite saline bouquet with good delineation, if not the intensity of others. The palate is well balanced with good acidity, an uncomplicated Desirée with focus, moderate complexity and a pleasing, saline finish. It is a competent Meursault, albeit one without the fireworks or the chutzpah of the premier crus. As such, like the Clos de la Barre, it is a wine to approach in the flush of youth.",,RP 87?
1253,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Les Duresses,"The 2014 Monthélie les Duresses was the only red not touched by hail and my sample was taken directly from vat, though it will not be bottled until the spring. It has plenty of fresh redcurrant and cassis scents on the nose. It is simple on the palate with fine tannins, plenty of fruit and a juicy blackberry finish that will give lots of pleasure over the next 4-6 years.",,RP 87?
1254,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Montrachet Grand Cru from Dominique Lafon is much more reduced on the nose compared to Marquis de Laguiche: waxier in style, less mineral-driven, sporting resinous scents that don't quite ""sing"" of Montrachet. The palate is fresh and crisp, a little shrillness on the entry with a sharp citric thread of acidity, finishing in more accomplished fashion than the nose augured with a saline aftertaste. It is quite amazing how this Montrachet magically gains more and more precision in the glass. It is a different style Montrachet to Laguiche but equally compelling.",,RP 87?
1255,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchère from Domaine des Comtes-Lafon has a controlled, linear and focused bouquet that is very well defined, poised and mineral-laden, a bouquet that will reward long-term cellaring. The palate is fresh and crisp, the acidity very well judged with wonderful tension on the classy, sophisticated and saline finish. This is an outstanding Meursault that shows real craftsmanship - superb.",,RP 87?
1256,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes from Dominique Lafon has a beautiful nose with lemon thyme, lime flower, mineral scents that are just so neatly poised and delineated. The palate has exquisite balance, perfectly judged acidity, wonderful poise and sustain in the mouth. This is exactly what you would seek from a top flight Meursault Charmes that will repay long-term cellaring. Dominique just nailed this one.",,RP 87?
1257,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières has a very delineated bouquet with limestone and granite notes, very reserved but very harmonious. It is clearly beautifully poised, very feminine and succinct with a very precise, spicy finish that lingers long in the mouth. There are no fireworks here, rather an accomplished cerebral Meursault with considerable ageing potential.",,RP 87?
1258,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots from Domaine des Comtes-Lafon has a very succinct and subtle bouquet, beautifully defined, backwards and introspective but I think there is huge potential here. The palate is clean, fresh and poised, a hint of sour lemon on the entry but thereafter it becomes cohesive and focused with hints of white chocolate furnished the long, persistent finish. This is another excellent 2012 from Dominique Lafon.",,RP 87?
1259,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu showed just a touch of reduction, but otherwise there is appreciable blackberry and briary fruit here, tertiary/woodland scents with just a splash of balsamic. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, good backbone, more backward than its peers and probably befitting another 12 months in bottle. Broody perhaps? Yet there is appreciable balance and its sturdiness will soften with time.",,RP 87?
1260,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières has an accomplished bouquet with subtle notes of lemon thyme, linden and chalk dust that unfurls nicely in the glass. The palate is fresh and taut on the entry, quite pointed acidity, vibrant and nervous with a mineral-rich finish that bodes well for the future. This is a very well crafted Meursault Genevrières, though it is not at the same quality level as Dominique's Charmes in 2012.",,RP 87?
1261,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Champans from Domaine des Comtes-Lafon has a rather skinny nose with blackberry and raspberry fruit, wet undergrowth and just a hint of blood orange. The palate is medium-bodied with quite an oaky entry, sweet in the mouth with good acidity and plenty of spice, though it lacks nuance and feels ""blocky"" on the finish. I hazard a guess that this Volnay is at an awkward stage given how well it performed from barrel and its track record, so I will reserve judgement for now.",,RP 87?
1262,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Tasted from magnum this time, this was a frighteningly backward, deeply impressive 1989 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu. Black plum dominates the nose flanked by blueberry and pastille-like notes. It is very pure but structured, obdurate and unyielding on the palate with perfectly matched acidity. It is an immense Volnay and yet it is one that demands respect more than doling out pleasure. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 87?
1263,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"I had not tasted the 2005 Meursault 1er Cru les Genevrières from Dominique Lafon for several years, but it is just as impressive as I remember. Here we have a seductive nose: hints of lemon thyme and sherbet at first, giving way to more tertiary notes, echoing the ""hawthorn"" remark that I made last time. The palate is clearly very well balanced and harmonious, with a smear of vanilla originating from the oak. There is impressive weight and mineralité developing on the finish that displays great length. It does not quite possess the profundity of the Meursault Caillerets from Jean-François Coche served alongside, but that should not detract from this marvellous Meursault.",,RP 87?
1264,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"Tasted blind at Farr Vintners Kumeu/White Burgundy tasting. There is a slight blowsiness on the nose of the 2009 Meursault from Domaine des Comtes-Lafon: not as clean as I would have liked, the fruit not expressive. The palate is sharp on the entry with sour lemon dominating the mid-palate. Sharp and rather abrasive, this is very atypical for a 2009 white Burgundy, and it feels slightly attenuated on the finish. I wonder if this is the most representative bottle.",,RP 87?
1265,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"The 2013 Volnay 1er Cru les Champans is bestowed a more powerful nose than the Clos des Chenes with perfumed, floral red and black fruit, the new oak nicely interwoven. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe and succulent tannins, real depth and body here with great nervosité on the detailed, almost electrifying finish. What a fantastic Champans from Dominique Lafon! This should be sensational once in bottle.",,RP 87?
1266,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d’Or has a very precise, mineral-driven bouquet with wet limestone and lime-flower scents that are almost Puligny in style. The palate is well balanced with expressive citrus fruit intermingling with peach and nectarine. It is an undeniably pretty Meursault in the making, one that I suspect will be very seductive.",,RP 87?
1267,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"There are just three barrels of the Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu this year. It has a dense and concentrated raspberry and wild strawberry bouquet interlaced with minerals, backward and broody as usual. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannin, a crisp level of acidity and a finish not unlike the Champans, although this is more opaque and standoffish. In my mind the Volnay Champans has a little more panache, but this has the substance to suggest long-term cellaring will be repaid.",,RP 87?
1268,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"The 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes, of which there are two and a half barrels, has a straitlaced black plum and blackberry bouquet. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy ripe blackcurrant and cassis notes, very good depth here, and then surfacing on the finish with elegant and quite tensile tannins. This is a well-crafted, strict Clos des Chênes that might be overshadowed by the Champans, but is still a worthy wine.",,RP 87?
1269,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"Tasting from a barrel from the old 65-year-old vines that had finished their malo earlier than the younger, the 2013 Meursault Clos de la Barre has a powerful smoke and hazelnut bouquet that bodes well for bottling. The palate is quite tensile on the entry with citrus peel, orange rind and hazelnut: linear in the mouth, but holding nothing back on the intense finish. This is a very commendable Meursault, even if it is overshadowed by of Dominique's more ""ambitious"" premier crus.",,RP 87?
1270,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"The 2013 Meursault Villages has an appealing bouquet with straightforward apple blossom and citrus aromas. The palate is well balanced with impressive weight in the mouth, a keen thread of acidity and pleasant, orange zest and hazelnut notes on the rather conservative finish. Satisfactory if not remarkable.",,RP 87?
1271,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Les Duresses,"The 2013 Monthélie les Duresses has a light but pure raspberry leaf and strawberry-scented bouquet that wafts gently from the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, a decent structure, with a sharp, pointed, tart cherry finish. What you might call a ""pretty little thing.""",,RP 87?
1272,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"There was just a tiny bit of reduction on the 2013 Meursault Desirée when I tasted it from barrel (it was racked onto the lees of the Meursault Village in order to get it going), but it gradually unfolds with hazelnut and flint aromas. The palate is well balanced, slightly honeyed in style with a soft, caressing citrus finish that is just missing a little complexity and just loses focus toward the finish. This was one where I felt just a little shortchanged.",,RP 87?
1273,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2007 Meursault les Perrieres from Dominique Lafon has a relatively extravagant bouquet that does not hold back: pralines, coconut, almond and then later a hint of creme caramel. The palate is well balanced with plenty of oak on the entry and that really is the leitmotif for this Perrieres, to such an extent that I yearn for more mineralite and Perrieres typicity to be expressed on the finish. Not a bad Meursault, but Dominique has made better Perrieres in other vintages.",,RP 87?
1274,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières from Dominique Lafon has a very composed bouquet, more Perrières in style that Roulot’s at the moment, with limestone and granite aromas filtering through nicely, gaining vigor all the time. The palate is clean and fresh, detailed with fresh lemon peel and touches of white peach in the background. It is beautifully poised and harmonious right to the finish, this is a very assured Perrières. There is huge potential locked into this wine.",,RP 87?
1275,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Porusots from Comtes-Lafon has improved since I last tasted it. It displays fine precision on the nose with touches of chalk, grilled walnuts, orange rind and citrus peel. It is intense, but very well controlled. The palate is fresh and vibrant with very well-judged acidity, lovely orange zest and subtle tropical fruit notes, with plenty of swagger and verve on the long finish. This is the most harmonious and convincing wine of this flight.",,RP 87?
1276,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Meursault 1er Cru Charmes 2011 from Comtes-Lafon has a slightly austere bouquet with touches of white flower and melted butter developing with aeration, while maintaining fine delineation and focus. The palate is clean and fresh with good acidity, vibrant citrus fruit and a wonderfully poised and vibrant finish that lacks a little persistence in the mouth.",,RP 87?
1277,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Volnay 1er Cru les Santenots 2011 from Comtes-Lafon has an agreeable bouquet with red cherries, raspberry and dried flowers, hints of lavender and rosemary developing with time. The palate is nicely balanced with fine tannins and well-judged acidity. It is a more feminine and lighter style of Volnay, but balanced, dovetailing into a rather conservative but fresh finish. This is a composed and refined showing.",,RP 87?
1278,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Champans,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is a touch of reduction on the nose of Dominique Lafon’s Volnay 1er Cru Champans 2011, although underneath is some crisp red cherry and strawberry scents that are desperate to come out. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe red cherries, strawberry and citrus fruit. This is nicely balanced with a composed finish that lingers nicely in the mouth without becoming overbearing, though it seems to lose a little tenacity with time in the glass. Still, this is a nicely crafted, understated drop.",,RP 87?
1279,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Meursault 1er Cru les Genevrières 2011 is austere on the nose and, to be honest, it seems a little anodyne compared to its peers. The palate is crisp on the entry with bitter lemon and orange rind. There is moderate weight in the mouth, but like the first wine there is a slight volatile element that blurs the finish. After 15 minutes the wine improves, developing more spiciness and tension, although it still lacks that ""je ne sais quoi.""",,RP 87?
1280,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is clearly a lot of new oak on the nose of the Volnay Clos des Chenes and it tends to subjugate the fruit. The palate is chewy and ripe on the entry, quite dense and sinewy but missing some grace and sophistication on the slightly over-baked finish. The spicy aftertaste is attractive, but feels a little labored compared to its peers. The previous bottle tasted at the domaine last year performed more promisingly.",,RP 87?
1281,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Bouchères from Dominique Lafon feels a little anonymous on the nose compared to the first two wines in a flight of Meursault premier cru. There is a subtle minerality at play, but it needs to be more assertive and expressive. The palate is balanced with touches of orange rind and walnut on the entry, but it does not really follow through with conviction and it dips prematurely on the finish. It may be undergoing a sulky phase, although I wager that the 2012 is better than this debut vintage.",,RP 87?
1282,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Macon Bussieres Le Monsard les Heritiers du Comte Lafon,"The barrel sample of 2013 Mâcon Bussieres Le Monsard les Heritiers du Comte Lafon needed a little SO2 that Dominique will apply soon, but it appears to have an outgoing, almost brioche-tinged bouquet that is beautifully defined. The palate is smooth, rounded and sumptuous with slightly lower acidity than the 2012 but there is evidence of huge weight on the finish. ",,RP 87?
1283,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Macon Bussieres Le Monsard les Heritiers du Comte Lafon,"The 2012 Mâcon Bussieres Le Monsard has a slightly deeper, subtle almond and white-chocolate-tinged bouquet that unfolds nicely in the glass. The palate has good body, a little more phenolic than the Mâcon-Uchizy with a dab of spice and pithy fruit towards the vibrant finish. ",,RP 87?
1284,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"Tasted blind, the 2005 Meursault Villages is maturing nicely, although whether it will repay continued cellaring is another matter. It has a very pure bouquet of light honey, indicative of a benevolent growing season, hints of pressed flowers and pralines developing with time. The palate is well-balanced, and under blind conditions, I was not the only one suggesting premier cru quality (a testament to the craftsmanship of Dominique Lafon). It is very harmonious and with aeration the wood component becomes just a little conspicuous, but you cannot dislike the orange zest on the pert finish. Drink now-2017.  Tasted March 2014.",,RP 87?
1285,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 1988 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes from Dominique Lafon has retained an elegant, almost understated bouquet with butterscotch and lanolin aromas, hints of puff pastry following suit, all with fine delineation. The palate is a potent orange zest entry and seems fully mature. But it is certainly well-balanced with a strict line of acidity, finally showing evidence of just a little fatigue towards the finish. Drink now. Tasted November 2013.",,RP 87?
1286,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"A solitary 350-litre used barrel instead of the usual three, the 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chenes has a lifted pure nose of brambly red fruit and wild hedgerow that is vibrant and vivacious. The palate is crisp and fresh with taut and tensile tannins, well-judged acidity, leading to a surprisingly dense finish that contains some gravitas. Readers should not that this will only be bottled in magnums and I suspect that it will age magnificently over a decade or more. 

I am a simmering ball of irritation sitting in Dominique Lafon's office watching the second hand chipping away at precious time. Where is he? Our rendezvous was 8.30am. Now it's past nine and I have to be at Rossignol-Trapet, essentially the other side of the world, at 10.15am. I should bolt out of the door. But I don't. I don't because this is Domaine des Comtes Lafon. They have what I call a ""special pass of forgiveness"" that is totally at my discretion and totally unfair. But that's just the way it is. He's probably stopped for a cigarette. Dominique Lafon appears just after 9:03am, suitably remorseful and the raffish rascal has so much charm that I have to resist playfully punching him on the arm and saying: ""It was my fault for demanding such an early start."" And so we immediately troop down to the cellars to taste the 2012s, starting with the reds that were depleted by one-third due to the multifarious obstacles mentioned all over this report. Dominique divulged that like everywhere else, there were tardy malo-lactic fermentations and that he had not racked the wines. At time of writing he doubts that he will do so. As for the whites, they were depleted by between one-third and one-half, in particular affecting Les Perrieres and Montrachet. Whereas usually Dominique has around 350 barrels in his care, in 2012 that number is around 170. Dominique gave me the minutiae of the harvest, which commenced on 14 September with the young vines in Clos de la Baronne and finished on 23 September in Monthelie and Montrachet. (Compare this to 2011 that began on 24 August and 2013 that began on the 25 September, two days after the 2012 was finished.) How were the wines? We don't have time. Let's bash on with the notes

1287,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or comes from 0.39-hectares of vine that were planted in 1991. It is more introverted on the nose compared to its siblings with apple peel and fresh pear scents combining with alpine stream. The palate has commendable weight and depth with a seam of lemongrass underneath the citrus fruits, wax resin and toffee apple towards the tender finish. This is a very fine premier cru.

It has a light, slightly more resinous bouquet with touches of honeysuckle. The palate is well balanced with a rounded opening: hints of dried apricot and a spicy vein towards the finish. This is an intriguing Meursault undecided how good it wants to be. I look forward to finding out after bottling.

1289,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Désirée,"Dominique is fairly sure he will bottle the 2012 Meursault les Desiree separately, this tiny 0.45-hectare parcel of infant vines planted in 2008 often blended with another cru. Cropped at 20 hectoliters per hectare, it has a crisp, citrus driven bouquet with good penetration. The palate is fresh and vibrant with citrus driven fruit, gaining weight and energy towards the spice-tinged finish. Yes - I think this is worth bottling separately.

It has a fragrant bouquet with scents of orange blossom and pink grapefruit that is well defined, vivacious at first and then receding.

1292,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Having tasted this three or four times in the past, I probably have under-rated this wine because it is such a long-term proposition. The 2005 Volnay Santenot has a dense, almost impenetrable bouquet that demands considerable aeration to unveil its multi-layered aromatic profile of creme de cassis, raspberry, blackberry and a veneer of new oak that needs several more years to be fully absorbed (indeed, it feels like more than the one-third new oak that Dominique uses). The palate is full-bodied with a sweet, succulent entry. It is beautifully balanced, vivacious and sensual with a dab of alcohol on the finish. It is far too young to broach at the moment, but it will develop with style over the next three decades. Drink 2018-2035.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 87?
1293,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The 2002 Volnay Santenot has a lovely open, generous bouquet with vibrant red fruit: redcurrant, freshly picked raspberry and wild hedgerow – perhaps just a touch of pine cone in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with a rounded, succulent entry. It feels harmonious and luscious in the mouth, the tannins just beginning to soften after a decade in bottle. There is something quite feminine about the 2002 although it does not quite possess the complexity or nuance of the 2005. Drink 2015-2030.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 87?
1294,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The 2000 Volnay Santenots might not be the greatest wine that Dominique Lafon has ever crafted, and for sure it is dictated by the limitations imposed by the challenging growing season. However, there is still much to be enjoyed here. It has a ripe damson and briary-scented bouquet with a citrus undertow, later developing a touch of yellow plum. The palate is smooth and fleshy. No, there is not great depth and it does not have the persistency of other vintages, but it is very fresh, lithe and harmonious with appealing leather and dried meat notes on the finish. Drink now-2020.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 87?
1295,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Some might regard my score for the 1999 as a bit mean, but this is a vintage that I find too ostentatious. It has a voluminous, brazen bouquet with saturated small dark cherries, dark plum and a touch of iodine – but for me, it seems to lack some class. The palate is very concentrated with thickset tannins, layers of glossy dark cherry and strawberry fruit that coat the plush tannic backbone. However, the finish is too sweet and consequently it does not entice another sip like the 1996, as if the wine is trying too hard to impress. In fact, although you could argue that analytically it is better than the 2000, it is the millennial wine I would choose to drink. Drink 2014-2025.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 87?
1296,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières from Comtes-Lafon is the first time that it has been bottled under DIAM. It has a more topical-tinged bouquet than Henri Boillot's Meursault Genevières, with scents of butterscotch and acacia complementing the citrus fruit. The palate is well balanced with vibrant acidity. Lighter in style than other Genevrières, it does not quite deliver the complexity that the nose promises and I would be inclined to drink this in its youth rather than grace it with bottle age. This showing did not tally with the barrel sample that I tasted and I wonder whether the alternative closure might have had something to do with that, since this was not the only 2013 from Dominique Lafon to show below the quality I was expecting. Tasted May 2016.",,RP 87?
1297,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru was a perplexing wine of three 2013 Montrachets served blind. It was burdened with a massive reduction on the nose that renders it indecipherable as a Montrachet. The palate is likewise very reduced and is denuded a sense of precision and mineralité. I am not sure what happened here? Maybe it will take years to eat up the sulfur dioxide? I will hopefully get another chance to taste this and pray that it was a one-off bottle. However, it does make me wonder whether there is just too much sulfur here? Tasted May 2016.",,RP 87?
1298,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières does not quite have the definition of the example from Château de Meursault. There are pleasant acacia and dried honey scents, but it needs more detail to develop in bottle. The palate is saline on the entry with fresh lime and green apple, moderate weight in the mouth and yet falling away a little short on the finish. I must confess that I was shocked when I discovered that this was from Domaine des Comtes Lafon. Like other 2013s, it was the first to be bottled under DIAM and again, I wonder if this has actually compromised what from barrel appeared to be a fantastic wine? Tasted May 2016.",,RP 87?
1299,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or has an expressive nose that is cut from a similar cloth to the Meursault Bouchère, but perhaps with more gumption: citrus fruit, white peach and a touch of honeysuckle even, all with fine mineral tones. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a keen thread of acidity, slightly honeyed with a hint of something sweet, maybe marzipan or coconut, on the finish. Like an excitable child, send them to kindergarten for 3-4 years before welcoming them back home, preferably to your dinner table.",,RP 87?
1300,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"There is just half the usual crop of the 2014 Meursault Clos de la Barre because of hail. It has a composed bouquet with light tropical tones, inward looking at the moment, perhaps needing more mineral expression. The palate is quite tense on the entry, the acidity a little sharper than the village cru, with fine precision if not length on the finish. This is a good Meursault, one that I would broach in its youth, leaving its siblings for the cellar.",,RP 87?
1301,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Village,"The 2014 Meursault Village, a blend of several vineyards, consists of 22 barrels rather than the usual 50 barrels. It has an understated bouquet, a little quiet at the moment though nicely defined. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with fine acidity, though it tapers slightly towards the finish. I feel that this was knocked sideways by the trauma of the hailstorm, a Meursault with its wings clipped and just doing the best that it can.",,RP 87?
1302,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The 2014 Meursault Desirée 1er Cru has a lifted, fresh pear, green apple and quite saline bouquet with good delineation, if not the intensity of others. The palate is well balanced with good acidity, an uncomplicated Desirée with focus, moderate complexity and a pleasing, saline finish. It is a competent Meursault, albeit one without the fireworks or the chutzpah of the premier crus. As such, like the Clos de la Barre, it is a wine to approach in the flush of youth.",,RP 94
1303,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Apparently Dominique Lafon regarded the 1978 Volnay Santenots as a benchmark wine until the 1985 came along. I can see why. Lighter in color than the 1976 and commensurate with a 35-year-old wine, it has a charming animally, feral bouquet with a cheeky dab of menthol that emerges from the wings with aeration. The palate is well-balanced with dry and firm tannins, but unlike the 1976, here it is counterbalanced with decayed red berry fruit infused with ferrous notes and Cepes. It swaggers in its dotage – lovely. Drink now-2020. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1304,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"While I am a fan of many under-rated 1976 Pinot Noirs, this is not one of the domaine’s best. Deeper and more turbid than the 1978, it has an opaque, meaty and, to be honest, rather charmless bouquet of burnt toast and field mushroom. The palate is hard and aloof, dominated by dry tannins that I feel must have been over-extracted at the time, leaving the finish brawny and austere. Past its best. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1305,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"The 1969 Volnay Santenots was tasted from two bottles. The first had a chlorophyll-dominated nose that sometimes tinctures mature Pinot Noir – rather like an old Victorian swimming pool, almost algae-like. The palate was rather enervated and more curiosity than an outright pleasure. The second (served blind, incidentally) was a different animal altogether. Here the nose exuded far more fruite with light, brambly, red berry fruit on the nose – decayed but still vital, reminiscent of a 1964. The palate was medium-bodied with crisp acidity and a soft, pleasant, autumnal finish. This is attractive, but would not satisfy those without a penchant for old rustic Burgundy! Drink now. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1306,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Comparing the 2004 Montrachet against the 2002, the latter is clearly the superior wine. The aromatics feel a little discombobulated at first, with suggestions of TCA or sulphur reduction. But allowing the wine to breathe, my conclusion is that it displays that mulchy, herbaceous element that afflicts so many 2004 Burgundies. The palate is still quite attractive with a fine line of acidity, notes of walnut and smoke, though there is just a touch of greenness marring the finish. This is a perplexing Montrachet that feels a little out of sorts. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1307,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"“Not too shabby” was the turn of phrase used by the ever-understated Jasper Morris. To translate that from English to American: a superb Montrachet. It is noticeably light in color than the 2002 Perrieres, yet the nose is much more delineated and mineral-rich with a subtle marine-influence (freshly shucked oyster shells) that lend the aromatics intrigue. The palate is very well-balanced with outstanding minerality and precision. You barely notice the weight and presence in the mouth as it cruises to a sublime, orange-zest and hazelnut-tinged finish that lingers long. Not too shabby, in other words. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1308,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2002 Meursault Perrieres sports a deep straw color, perhaps just a bit deeper than I would like. It has an attractive bouquet of dried honey, beeswax, honeysuckle and damp straw with fine delineation. The palate is nicely balanced with a spicy opening and good weight, although it lacks a little finesse on the powerful, burly finish and I would have liked to have seen more Perrieres minerality. If I had bottles in my cellar, I would be inclined to drink them over the next decade. Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1309,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d’Or has similar clay to Porusots that lends them similar weight. It has a complex nose of lime flower, quince and hazelnut that gains intensity in the glass. The palate is actually quite similar to the Porusots on the entry, but for me, the finish shows superior tension and poise. This is one of Dominique’s finest. Drink 2014-2028.  

It was great to see Dominique Lafon three weeks after meeting him in Macon, this time back in Meursault. That semi-pornographic, licentious wine advertisement still hung on the office wall (those that have been there know what I mean) and a cigarette butt drooped from Dominique’s mouth, possibly the same one he lit when I bid him farewell back in Macon. If you added up all the charisma and charm in Bordeaux it still would amount to less than Dominique Lafon. I have tasted at this address for over a decade, but this marked the first time I had been presented his complete set of Premier Cru Meursault wines since his acquisition from Domaine Manuel with Jean-Marc Roulot. He remarked that possibly with the exception of a negociant, he is the only vigneron with all six top-tier Premier Crus south of the village. Dominique opened his full range of 2011s, including the Montrachet, which he avowed to polish off with a fish supper that night. How I would have loved to join him. Needless to say, this was an exemplary set of 2011s that do not disappoint. While like many others he concedes that 2010s have the upper hand and are likely to outlive them, he admires the 2011s for their approachability and charm.

It has a generous bouquet that is spicier than the Village Cru with hints of smoked walnut emerging with time. The palate takes the tempo down a notch: mellow, refined and harmonious with beautifully integrated oak and a sumptuous lightly honeyed finish. Lovely. Drink now-2022+

It was assembled in tank around January and bottled around early June. It offers an attractive bouquet with hints of wild honey, orange blossom and quince. The palate is refined on the entry but then motors up a few gears toward the finish with hints of brioche and popcorn infusing the citrus fruit. There is good richness here for a Village Cru.

1315,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"A sublime, seamless wine, the 2010 Montrachet impresses for its fabulous balance and sense of harmony. All the elements are in the right place. Floral aromatics meld effortlessly into highly nuanced fruit. Hints of smoke, slate and mint add complexity. Not surprisingly, the Montrachet has tightened up considerably since I tasted it from barrel last fall. The 2010 is going to require a measure of patience. Today, it is an infant, and also shows some of the effects of its recent bottling in June, 2012. Lafon’s parcels lie on the Chassagne side, but the wine itself shows more of a Puligny-like finesse. Anticipated maturity: 2016+.

There are two recurring themes every time I taste with Dominique Lafon; this is always one of the top visits in Burgundy, and there never seems to be enough time to explore all of the nuances in each of these wines. Lafon was fortunate to escape the vintage with just 20% lower yields than 2009, which here translates to 32 hectoliters per hectare as compared to 35 in a normal year and 40 in an abundant year. The malos were very, very slow. In fact, there were a few barrels still finishing their malos in early December, 2011. The 2009 reds have also turned out beautifully. I will report on those wines in the April issue.

1329,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay Village,"The 2010 Volnay (from young vines in Santenots) boasts incredible depth and power. The intensity and structure of the vintage come through in spades. This is a decidedly muscular style of Volnay. Today it is the richest of Lafon’s 2010s. It will be interesting to see the direction the wine takes over the next year. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2030.  

There are two recurring themes every time I taste with Dominique Lafon; this is always one of the top visits in Burgundy, and there never seems to be enough time to explore all of the nuances in each of these wines. Lafon was fortunate to escape the vintage with just 20% lower yields than 2009, which here translates to 32 hectoliters per hectare as compared to 35 in a normal year and 40 in an abundant year.

Dominique Lafon's 2009s are just as stunning from bottle as they were when I tasted them in cask earlier this year. Lafon is one of the most thoughtful growers in Burgundy.

Except as noted, I tasted the 2009s from bottle. The 2009 Charmes, Perrieres and Montrachet were bottled in May, 2011. I also tasted all of the 2010s from barrel. The Meursault, Clos de la Barre and Goutte d-Or weren't showing well, while the Meursault premier crus and the Montrachet were all sublime.

I arrived at Lafon just as the last of the 2009s were being bottled. Dominique Lafon describes the 2009 harvest as a generous one, which I am sure he was quite happy about given 2008. The approach at Lafon can be best described as gentle. The wines are mostly made from 100% destemmed fruit (the 2009 Monthelie is an exception, with 25% whole clusters). The fruit undergoes a cold soak of 4-5 days followed by a maceration of three weeks on the skins. After pressing the wines are left in steel for two weeks to encourage natural decantation, and are then racked into barrel with the fine lees. New oak is about 25% for the Monthelie, 33% for the Volnay and Clos des Chenes, and slightly more for the Champans and Santenots. Vintage 2008 was not an easy one for Dominique Lafon. In Volnay, the cold spring and ensuing irregular flowering lowered yields by a third, until hail in July took care of another third. Lafon said these were the lowest yields he had ever seen in his career. The remaining fruit, though, was quite pretty, as these sublime 2008s amply demonstrate. Lafon may be best known for his whites, but readers should pay just as much attention to these superb reds.

This fine representative of its vintage and site should be worth cellaring for 5-7 years.

Dominique Lafon’s vineyards were hit hard by the July, 2008 hail, with his largest site – Santenots du Milieu – worst hit, and reduced in production by two-thirds, all of which he bottled together, rather than (as more usually) declassifying the young vines portion to village Volnay. Crop loss was due to dehydration as well, a factor compounded by late harvest. (“But before October,” relates Lafon, “the fruit simply was not ripe.”) Lafon’s chagrin – coming on the heels of two challenging vintages for Pinot – was more than assuaged, though, by the superb quality of his Meursaults in both 2007 and 2008 (on which I shall report soon in these pages).

Alkaline, charred, and moss-like notes complement the typical fungal notes of this site and make for considerable complexity. This will keep well for a half dozen years, but there is no need to defer gratification.

It has a wonderful bouquet that is very focused: raspberry, a touch of cassis, Indian ink and just a suggestion of singed leather. It has a sweet entry on the palate that is underpinned by fine tannins and an elegant, sensual finish that lacquers but never oppresses the mouth. There is wonderful tension and purity in this Volnay, perhaps in some ways auguring the style of wine post-2000.

1347,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"Given the quality of the growing season, the 1995 Volnay flirts with disappointment, even though it remains an attractive wine. It has a gritty, open-knit, scorched earth bouquet with a hint of incense. But the aromatics lack the cohesion and purity of the 1996. The palate is medium-bodied and quite linear.

The 1993 has a lighter and perhaps more austere bouquet than coeval vintages, but leaving it in my glass, it reveals hidden facets such as Dorset plum, raspberry and even a faint scent of cola. The palate is medium-bodied with a firm structure. It is a little drier than the 1993 but nicely focused with a very classic, reserved finish that leaves the imbiber wanting another sip. Perhaps in retrospect I was expecting a little more class, but it is what it is. Drink now-2020+.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94
1349,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu,"As a Burgundy lover, I have a penchant for the 1991s, which were over-shadowed by the previous vintage. The 1991 Volnay Santenot has an attractive bouquet that does not possess the precocity of the 1990, but offers enticing scents of dried herb, mushroom and a drop of Hoi Sin. The palate is well-balanced with boysenberry jam on the entry. The tannins lend this 1991 good backbone and it boasts a lovely citrus edge that lends tension on the finish. Do not overlook this superb Volnay. Drink now-2022+.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 94

The palate has more volume and more viscosity than the 1989: very sensual and quite modern in style when you compare it to the 1985 or 1978. But there is a riveting sense of completeness here, a wine that will not let you down from start to finish and, moreover, you can envisage it continuing to perform at a top level for another 20 years. Drink now-2025+.  Tasted September 2013.",,RP 91
1351,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Flowers, peach, and nut oils are dramatically front and center in the Lafon 2006 Montrachet as well. Here is the one overtly creamy wine in this collection, yet it doesn’t in the least lack for ripe citrus juiciness. This lacks the sense of dynamic felt in the Perrieres, but is somehow both statuesque and at the same time ethereal and cloud-like. Suggestions of minerality here have near-sweetness, like fresh scallops or a lobster shell reduction. A virtually indelible finish suggests distilled floral essences, nut oils, ginger, and crustacean. Too bad there are a mere four barrels of this stunning elixir. The penetration of herbal distillates and citrus oil; seductively sweet gardenia florality; bittersweet nuttiness; and an astonishing combination of super-ripeness and verve, all place the 2005 in the same exalted class.

Like his neighbor Jean-Marc Roulot, Benoit Ente in Puligny, and a few others, Dominique Lafon obtained authorization to begin picking several days ahead of the official ban de vendange. He set his crew to work over the weekend, and was finished already on the 20th of September. The Perrieres, picked first, reached 13.8% alcohol, but all of the other wines weighed in at lower levels. Lafon insisted – and his wines testified – that the Chardonnay grapes were botrytis free, and he characterized the lees as excellent in quality and practiced “less settling than I did in the past.” That restraint – along with bright acids and pronounced minerality – makes for a richness that often expresses itself other than in creaminess. As these wines evolved, Lafon became increasingly enthusiastic about them, and I found them much more expressive on the eve of bottling than they had been in late 2007. Incidentally, the sickly vines in Lafon’s Desiree vineyard that have given so much bottled pleasure over the years gave their last in the beautifully refined, bittersweet, and for the vintage unusually delicate and creamy 2005. “It tastes as though the vines knew they were going to be pulled out,” was Lafon’s valediction.

1352,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Ripe apricot, white peach, jasmine, nut oil, fresh lime and hazelnut pour from the glass of Lafon 2006 Meursault Perrieres. Offering an amazing combination of subtly creamy richness and underlying firmness with utmost elegance and wafting floral notes, the 14 barrels’ worth of this beauty from 55 year old vines represent around 60% new wood, but it’s not noticeable as such. The finishing interplay of floral, fruit, nut oil, and mineral nuances in the finish will keep you occupied for minutes at a time, and this densely layered yet lacy Meursault should merit more than a decade of attention in the bottle as well. The subtly truffle-scented, extraordinarily mineral, tartly-fruited 2005 lacks the lift, and elegance of the 2006 but is memorably-concentrated, almost severe in finish, and brimming with potential.

1353,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The Lafon 2006 Meursault Genevrieres – all but two of its six and a half barrels from 60 year-old vines – exudes aromas of hyacinth, honeysuckle, apple blossom, lime, and quince; exhibits a remarkable clarity and striking interplay of Chablis-like iodine and saline savor and a hint of peach kernel bitterness playing against pure ripe orchard fruit and nut oils; and finishes ravishingly floral, pure in fruit, refreshing, and utterly insistent in its diverse mineral expressions. While consuming this extraordinary wine in its youth would be no crime, I would anticipate at least a decade’s worth of further interest to emerge from bottle. The intensely floral and herbal – and for the vintage surprisingly refreshing – 2005 is tightly-stitched, palpable chalky, and age-worthy, reminding me slightly of a great Cotat Sancerre.

1354,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The Lafon 2006 Puligny-Montrachet Champ Gains comes from a stand of tiny-berried, partly-diseased, middle-aged vines that he now manages for a friend. There are only three and a half barrels (one new), although he believes full production should be five or six. Iris and fresh lime in the nose lead to a sleek, polished, very subtly creamy palate with a vivid sense of bright citrus and tiny-berried phenolic grip. Juicy and refreshing, positively starched with chalky, saline, savory minerality, yet also subtly, persistently creamy, this finishes with impressive energy, positively shimmering with minerality and crystal clear fruit. While there is no relevant track record, this strikes me as a wine worthy of 7-10 years cellaring. The equally savory if less elegant 2005 exhibits oceanic depth, including a tidal finish - a profound and age-worthy gem.

1355,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Coming largely from 70-, 40- and 15-year old vines, and treated to around half new barrels, Lafon’s 2006 Meursault Charmes is both more open-knit and more overtly chalky and creamy than its stable mates, but displays notable polish and subtlety. Its nose of diverse citrus and pit fruits is tinged with notes of toast and vanilla. The finish here really “Charms”, enveloping and fanning out expansively, with no let up in sweetness of fruit or suggestions of crushed stone. “Honestly,” Lafon remarks, “when you taste wine from the 70 year old vines before racking, it’s just so lean and so mineral that on its own it’s almost undrinkable, too tough” and benefits from “a portion of young vines which is always much more up-front.” Expect this to be worth following for at least 8-10 years.  The spicy, subtly bitter 2005 is polished and well-concentrated, but betrays extraneous hints of barrel and heat, and was outclassed by its siblings on both occasions when I tasted it.

1356,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Lafon’s. 2006 Meursault Gouttes d’Or displays ripe pear and apple, along with a prominent alkaline mineral character. Penetrating, bright, and overtly chalky, this finishes with a long fruit and mineral colloquy, and invigoratingly bitter hints of citrus zest and quinine. I suspect this Meursault – which Lafon was set to bottle last – can be counted on for 7-10 years of interesting bottle maturation. The 2005 – plush wine with a spine – exhibits a saline, carnal intensity that calls to mind Chablis.

1357,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault Clos de la Barre,"The Lafon 2006 Meursault Clos de la Barre offers another example of very clear, bright fruit; a polished, satiny texture yet with underlying firmness and palpable mineral density; nut oil richness; and a long, expressive finish featuring luscious lime, grapefruit, and pineapple. Along with narcissus and citrus, there are hints of coconut, vanilla, and lanolin on the nose, although only 3-4 of the 50-some barrels were new. Some of the exotic character on exhibit here can be chalked up to “late” harvest, so quickly were the grapes evolving in the four prior days of picking. I suspect this will be best enjoyed over the next 4-6 years.  The more mineral – iodine, salt, chalk – inflected 2005 is formidably dense and sappy.

1358,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Monthélie Blanc Village,"Sadly, at only three barrels production, Lafon’s white 2006 Monthelie doesn’t get much distribution outside of a few local restaurants, his picking crew, and “friends of the house.” But this Riesling-lover’s white Burgundy is certainly worth the proverbial search of the marketplace. A gorgeous bouquet of assorted flowers leads to a silken-textured yet almost delicate as well as decidedly refreshing palate. Hints of chalk, salt, and cress lend an invigorating note to the pristine, persistently floral finish. This should be delightful at least through 2010.

This should be worth cellaring for 3-5 years. The almost briny, deeply savory 2005 is impressive if less refreshing or fun to drink today.

Two thirds of his half a hectare in Champans is planted with 85 year-old vines. Typically for this site, the nose  is generous with mushroom and forest floor, but there is also a wealth of flowers and of blackberry and strawberry fruit, which follow onto the palate in a briskly-concentrated form. Beef and mushroom stock, wet stone, moss, and wood smoke anchor the lower-range of this complex Volnay, wine beautifully 2005 in its combination of freshness of fruit yet darkly-hued, walk-in-the-forest personality.

Black cherry and red currant fruit are tinged with ginger and coffee grounds. This exhibits a vintage-typical clarity, sap and freshness yet also a flattering creaminess of texture. Cool, fresh fruit character, subtle suggestions of fungus and flowers, and faintly sizzling spiciness inform a long, refined, and refreshing yet soothing finish. Lafon says he went easy on extraction this year precisely to showcase the sort of vividly fresh fruit that is on exhibit here.

This offers bright aromas and flavors of black raspberry sorbet, brown spice and fungal complexities and a fine sense of chalkiness, all of this rather reminiscent of Volnay. The tannins are abundant but fine. A tart fruit skin edge and faintly bitter black chocolate character in the finish offer satisfying counterpoint with the wine’s fresh fruit. I would plan on enjoying this beauty at 5-7 years age.

Unlike his other 2005s, this finished malo “on time” and was racked to tank at the end of the summer, from which he bottled it the day I visited. Scents of lavender and fresh black cherry lead to a fresh, tight, rather brisk palate with tart fruit skin and bitter black chocolate accents. This boasts refined tannins and lingering spice, even if it lacks a bit of mid-palate weight or richness. And I feel compelled to make allowance for its having come right off the bottling line.

This liquid satin of a wine slithers onto the palate, expands, and unleashes waves of roasted minerals, sage, bacon, spices, pears, and buttered toast. Medium-bodied and noble, it displays an unreal finish that lingers for a minute offering additional flavors of creamed hazelnuts, hints of sweet limes, and spiced apples.

This should be worth hanging onto for another couple of years before opening but I still expect it will be best enjoyed within half a dozen.

There is a Riesling- or Chenin-like sense of purity and precision as well as fine concentration allied with lift and delicacy about this Monthelie that render it eminently and immediately appealing, and even though it is not really complex, in the finish there are subtle suggestions of things mineral.

1451,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Goutte d'Or,"Dominique Lafon was not pleased with his Meursault Goutte D'Or* when I visited him in November and was considering blending it in with his regular Meursault cuvee if it did not evolve properly. While excellent, and potentially outstanding, I can understand Lafon's concern as it does not appear to be at the level of his other premier crus. A tightly wound, buttered popcorn-scented nose gives way to a wide, broad, expressive, creamy, and medium-to-full-bodied personality with toasty minerals and white peaches. At the time of my tasting this wine's personality seemed to tail off  abruptly. Projected maturity: 2000-2004.

The rating, with the range of scores in parentheses, indicates the wine was tasted from cask, not bottle.

Dominique Lafon performed more batonnage than usual on his 1996s, ""to give them more richness,"" he said. However, unlike some other vignerons, Lafon abandons the practice when the malos start because he wants his wines to be protected by the carbon dioxide gas that is a by product of a wine's malo-lactic fermentation. Lafon's yields were between 35 and 45 hectoliters/hectare, demonstrating his dedication to quality in this potentially high-yielding vintage.

1455,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Dominique Lafon was faced with an interesting problem after the 1995 harvest. The low yields provided him with only enough Montrachet to fill 2 and a half casks. He considered using a half-cask and 2 regular ones but decided against it because he feels wines do not age well in small casks. His solution was to have a new cask built that would hold the equivalent of one and a half regular ones. To offset the new oak flavors of this large vessel, the second cask he is using has been used previously to make five vintages of wine. Possessing a super-tight and unyielding nose, this full-bodied Montrachet displays intense minerally fruit, and striking elegance. While not as forward or sultry as I expected, it has a superb structure. This tight wine will need 6-7 years to blossom, and will drink admirably for another 15-20.

Dominique Lafon, who has run this estate on his own since 1987, feels his '95s are the best set of wines he's made to date. I would ignore this kind of statement from most growers in Burgundy as they are often given to hyperbole, but Lafon walks the walk in addition to talking the talk. His reputation is such that his wines sell-out instantaneously irrespective of what critics might write. Secondly, he's not the type of man who would risk his credibility, nor is he given to immodest boasting. His '95s are outstanding wines that may have better structure than those from previous vintages, and, therefore, may age and evolve more gracefully. He has produced fatter, lusher wines in the past (the '89s for example), but, in general, cellaring hasn't improved them. I believe the '95 will be different.

1464,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Montrachet Grand Cru,"On January 17, 1997, a Belgian wine merchant held a comprehensive tasting of virtually every  Montrachet at the Crillon Hotel in Paris. In addition to myself, Pierre Rovani was the only other American in attendance. The group was evenly split between members of the Belgian/French wine trade and private consumers. I was permitted to insert several top California Chardonnays in the tasting as ""ringers."" I provided the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge and the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. The tasting was impeccably organized, with the wines served blind in multiple flights. The results, although not unbelievable to me, were shocking to the group of serious Belgian and French wine tasters. Two of the French tasters were well-known winemakers. One of them who asked to remain anonymous proclaimed that in large part, the group of Montrachets was ""a crime against France's patrimony."" The group overwhelmingly rated the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge the top wine. Several tasters recognized that it was a California wine, but they still felt it was by far the most compelling, complex, and complete wine of the tasting. Second place went to another ""ringer,"" the  Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Le Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, third place was awarded to the  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne another ringer, and fourth place went to yet another ""ringer,"" the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. Of the Montrachets, three producers produced wines that certainly merited outstanding ratings. The fifth place wine was the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti  Montrachet; sixth place went to Domaine Lafon's  Montrachet; and seventh place was the  Domaine Ramonet Montrachet.

My numerical ratings generally mirrored the group's, with the Peter Michael Pointe Rouge receiving 97 points, Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, 95;  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne, 96+; Mount Eden 1992 Chardonnay Estate, 94; DRC  Montrachet, 93; Domaine Lafon  Montrachet, 91+; Domaine Ramonet  Montrachet, 90+; and most of the other Montrachets in the mid to upper-eighties, except for the appalling  Montrachets from Delagrange-Bachelet and Rene Fleurot. A tropical fruit-scented, disjointed the acidity stuck out as it does in many New World Chardonnays  Robert Drouhin Montrachet Marquis de la Guiche was another underachiever. Only four of the Montrachets possessed the depth and richness or the group's top three wines. Perhaps the most remarkable conclusion of this tasting was that none of the Montrachets displayed the complexity of the group's favorite three wines. And let's not hear any whining about these Montrachets needing 5-10, perhaps 15 years of cellaring. That may be the case in vintages such as 1986 or 1995, but the  Montrachets are extremely forward, low acid wines except those that appeared to have had far too much acidity added. Too many of them were diluted, disjointed, flabby, and flat compared to the non-Montrachet wines of this tasting.

Much is being made in European wine writing circles about American versus European tastes, another phony non-issue by writers who would better serve their readership by doing more tasting than pontificating. While no single tasting can be considered definitive, this particular tasting did prove that a group of French and Belgian tasters exhibited a preference for California Chardonnays. C'est la vie.

It was put in the bottle unfined and unfiltered, so do not be surprised by any sediment that forms within the next 6-12 months.  The wine offers up a magnificent nose of minerals, buttery apples, and spring flowers.  Honeyed, rich, and full-bodied, this deep, layered wine exhibits low acidity, as well as sensational balance and depth.  Drink it over the next 10-15 years.

What Lafon achieved in 1991 is extraordinary.  His wines are the greatest wines of the vintage.  In 1991 he put most of the cuvees of white wine in the bottle with neither fining nor filtration.

Lafon's 1991s are the wines of the vintage.  Modestly, Lafon says he took some unnecessary gambles by waiting out the rains and picking late, harvesting fruit that was not diluted.  The results are splendidly rich, full-bodied wines with amazing intensity.  They are as exceptional as the 1990s, and superior to Lafon's 1988s, 1987s, and 1986s.  Average yields were 25 hectoliters per hectare, compared to 55-70 at other domaines.  Three of the four single-vineyard Meursaults were outstanding.

This wine tends to be among the fruitiest and most obvious of Lafon's wines, but in 1991 it possesses a level of extract and complexity that I have rarely detected in the past.  This long, full-bodied wine will be among the shortest-lived of the vineyard-designated Meursaults.

1487,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The blockbuster 1989 Meursault-Charmes is one of the richest, most intense wines I have ever tasted from Lafon.  This wine exhibits decadent levels of richness, amazing amounts of glycerin, and an extraction level that is usually only found in the finest white burgundy grands crus.  The huge nose of super-ripe apples, buttered toast, and nuts is followed by a wine of awesome richness, and phenomenal length and poise.  All of this is held together by crisp acidity, another indication that this 1989 vintage, for all its precociousness and unctuous fruit, is going to evolve well.  Comte Lafon's Charmes vineyard is on the Puligny-Montrachet border, next to the Les Combettes premier cru vineyard of Etienne Sauzet.  Interestingly, the vineyard is planted with vines of which two-thirds are 65 years of age, and one-third 40 years of age. 

Meursault yields for the Comte Lafon in 1989 were a minuscule 25 hectoliters per hectare.  In high yield years, the wines of the Comte Lafon are usually among the most concentrated in Burgundy.  From this readers can extrapolate the kind of intensity levels one is dealing with in a vintage such as 1989.  Dominique Lafon, who is now in complete charge in the cellars, has continued to move toward a more organic style of winemaking.  He has eliminated all fertilizers except for manure, uses minimum amounts of sulphur, and bottles his Meursault unfiltered.  If you have the requisite discretionary income, these Meursaults are must purchases.

Despite its enormous size, the wine is remarkably well-balanced, even backward.  Do not expect it to be fully mature for at least 5-6 years.  It should evolve over the next two decades.

The steely, mineral aromas of its bouquet are reminiscent of the Meursault-Perrieres.  In the mouth, there is awesome concentration, surprisingly high acidity for the vintage, and exhilarating definition and length.  I am not sure it will ever offer the drama and opulence of the 1989 Meursault-Charmes, or the intensity of the 1989 Meursault-Perrieres, but it is an extraordinary effort from the Comte Lafon.

While this is a beautiful Meursault, 4-5 years of cellaring is essential.  Do not be surprised to see it evolve for 10-15 years.

Layers of dark, brooding fruit come forth gradually, along with exotic scents of new leather, licorice, tar and soy that add complexity. This is a decidedly reserved, mineral-driven Barbera that will appeal most to readers who appreciate the focused side of Barbera as opposed to more opulent vintages such as 2007 where the fruit is decidedly forward. The Cascina Francia shows greater richness and density than the Ceretta, suggesting the direction that wine is likely to take in coming years. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2023.  

Few properties are so closely linked with a single site as Giacomo Conterno. Since 1978 the Cascina Francia vineyard in Serralunga, a monopole holding, has been the source of all of the estate’s wines, including the Baroli Cascina Francia and Monfortino, rightly considered by most observers as among the most profound wines in the world. Needless to say, it was big news when proprietor Roberto Conterno purchased three hectares in Ceretta, also in Serralunga, in 2008. Would the new wines reflect the same house aesthetic as the wines from Cascina Francia, or would the terroir of Ceretta be the dominant factor? Could Ceretta yield wines of similar importance as those of Cascina Francia? After all, Cascina Francia was a cornfield with a few old vines from a past life when the Conternos purchased it in 1974. These were some of the questions Barolo lovers asked, and now, two years later some answers have begun to emerge. The first, and most obvious, is that the new wines are loaded with the Conterno house style. That said, they are works in progress. Roberto Conterno took over his parcels in Cerretta in mid-2008, after which he had the misfortune of suffering through several hailstorms. When I visited the new vineyards in the summer of 2008 Conterno told me he thought it would take two to three years for the vines to respond to his methods of viticulture. Clearly 2008 is not the optimal vintage by which to measure the ultimate potential of these wines, but there appears to be much to look forward to based on the 2009s I tasted from barrel recently. All of that said, the star among these new releases is without question the 2002 Monfortino, a wine that is destined to carve a place for itself as one of the greatest wines ever made. That it is the product of a vintage that was disastrous for nearly every other producer in Piedmont will only add to the shroud of mystique that has surrounded this wine since its birth.

1500,Domaine Henri Boillot,Langhe Nebbiolo Cerretta,"The 2008 Langhe Nebbiolo Cerretta offers up red berries, mint, geranium, dried roses and herbs in a relatively soft, approachable style. The mid-weight Langhe Nebbiolo is already a touch forward, so it is best enjoyed sooner rather than later. This, too, is full of character, even if the modest quality of the vintage caused Roberto Conterno to bottle this as Langhe Nebbiolo rather than Barolo, undoubtedly the right call. In some ways, this reminds me of the 1994 Barolo Cascina Francia in its delicate, somewhat ethereal, personality. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2016.

1501,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"The 2006 Barolo Cascina Francia is a deep, muscular wine endowed with superb richness, inner perfume and structure. From cask this has always been an intense, inward Barolo and now that it is in bottle, those qualities seem even more prominent. Over time, the classic Cascina Francia bouquet of roses, tar, herbs and licorice comes forward, but only reluctantly. A massive wall of tannins prevents the fruit from emerging, but every now and then the wine shows hints of its ultimate potential. The finish alone is breathtakingly beautiful for its balance and inner sense of harmony. The 2006 is not as showy young as other recent great vintages such as 2001 or 2004, so I will not be surprised if it is overlooked, but it is a magnificent Barolo that only needs time, and lots of it.

1502,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"Conterno’s 2002 Barolo Riserva Monfortino is a legend in the making, or now that it is in bottle, it may be more correct to simply say it is a legend. The late Giovanni Conterno and his son Roberto Conterno created quite a stir when they announced that they would make their Monfortino in 2002, a year in which most of the harvest in Piedmont was severely compromised by a cold summer and devastating hail in early September. But there was more. The Conternos not only announced that they would make their Monfortino in 2002 but no Barolo Cascina Francia for the first time ever in the estate’s history. In a bit of defiance towards the press, the Conternos then announced no one would be allowed to taste the wine from barrel. Over the years, this stance softened. Visitors lucky enough to visit the cellars and sample the wine from cask knew what was in store. Simply put, the 2002 Monfortino is stratospheric. A dark, imposing, but sensual wine, it flows from the glass with a breathtaking array of dried roses, autumn leaves, wild cherries, plums, new leather, espresso, licorice and spices, showing phenomenal depth, richness and balance. The tension between the luxuriousness of the fruit and the austerity of the vintage is truly captivating. I have tasted the 2002 Monfortino multiple times from barrel and bottle. At times it has reminded me of what I imagine the 1971 tasted like upon release, at other times it has seemed more similar to 1978. According to Giovanni Conterno, the 2002 reminded him of the 1971. Either way, the wine is extraordinary. The 2002 Monfortino is the result of the cold vintage that was typical of Piedmont up until the mid 1980s. In many ways, it is a throwback to wines that can’t be made anymore in Piedmont. Roberto Conterno thought so highly of the 2002 Monfortino he gave the wine an extra year in barrrel. And of course, there is one sad footnote. The world lost Giovanni Conterno to cancer in 2004, but he made sure his last Monfortino was at least equal, if not better, than his most monumental wines. There is little doubt the 2002 Monfortino will soon take its place as one of the greatest Monfortinos ever made. It is the most fitting last chapter to the life of one of the world’s greatest winemakers. As always, I suggest readers who have an interest in Monfortino taste the wine as soon as possible, as it will soon head into a period of dormancy, which in this vintage may last several decades. One of my favorite vintages for current drinking is the 1970, which still looks to have another 30 years of fine drinking ahead of it! Anticipated maturity: 2027-2052. 

Few properties are so closely linked with a single site as Giacomo Conterno. Since 1978 the Cascina Francia vineyard in Serralunga, a monopole holding, has been the source of all of the estate’s wines, including the Baroli Cascina Francia and Monfortino, rightly considered by most observers as among the most profound wines in the world. Needless to say, it was big news when proprietor Roberto Conterno purchased three hectares in Ceretta, also in Serralunga, in 2008. Would the new wines reflect the same house aesthetic as the wines from Cascina Francia, or would the terroir of Ceretta be the dominant factor? Could Ceretta yield wines of similar importance as those of Cascina Francia? After all, Cascina Francia was a cornfield with a few old vines from a past life when the Conternos purchased it in 1974. These were some of the questions Barolo lovers asked, and now, two years later some answers have begun to emerge. The first, and most obvious, is that the new wines are loaded with the Conterno house style. That said, they are works in progress. Roberto Conterno took over his parcels in Cerretta in mid-2008, after which he had the misfortune of suffering through several hailstorms. When I visited the new vineyards in the summer of 2008 Conterno told me he thought it would take two to three years for the vines to respond to his methods of viticulture. Clearly 2008 is not the optimal vintage by which to measure the ultimate potential of these wines, but there appears to be much to look forward to based on the 2009s I tasted from barrel recently. All of that said, the star among these new releases is without question the 2002 Monfortino, a wine that is destined to carve a place for itself as one of the greatest wines ever made. That it is the product of a vintage that was disastrous for nearly every other producer in Piedmont will only add to the shroud of mystique that has surrounded this wine since its birth.

1503,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"In this context, the 1990 Barolo Riserva Monfortino is almost too much. While the 1990 Cascina Francia delivers tons of pleasure, the 1990 Monfortino is still years away from offering its finest drinking. Still, this breathtaking Barolo is a pleasure to drink for its round fruit and long, powerful finish. It is exceptional in every way. Here the fruit is quite a bit darker in tonality than the Cascina Francia, with mesmerizing layers of mocha, leather, licorice and tobacco that develop in the glass and add further complexity. This is a marvelous effort from Conterno, but it will require the patience of a saint. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2050.

Giovanni Conterno was one of the icons of his generation. These three Barolos are some of Conterno’s finest achievements in a distinguished career that was cut tragically short in 2004. Conterno was among the first growers to recognize that owning his own vineyards would ultimately allow for greater control over the quality of his fruit, a forward-thinking view at a time when Piedmont was dominated by a negociant culture of large bottlers who bought grapes and wine in bulk from smaller properties. In 1974 Conterno spent a princely sum to acquire Cascina Francia, the vineyard that would become the exclusive source for his Barolos. Cascina Francia, a high-altitude monopole in the village of Serralunga, is typically one of the last vineyards in the Barolo region to be harvested. Conterno’s epic Barolo Riserva Monfortino, arguably the single most important wine made in Italy, is a selection of plots within the vineyard. The exact source of the fruit can vary from year to year, but Monfortino is only made in the finest vintages. Both Conterno Barolos are vinified along rigorously traditional methods, with long fermentations and extended aging in oak that reaches seven years (sometimes more) for the Monfortino. These are reference-point bottles for readers who seek to understand the genius of one of Piedmont’s truly legendary producers.",,RP 97
1504,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"Sadly, in 1989 Mother Nature was not kind to Conterno, as hail wreaked havoc on the vines. There was no Monfortino that year, and Conterno released just 4,000 bottles of his 1989 Barolo Cascina Francia. Leather, spices, tobacco and licorice are some of the nuances that emerge from this austere, powerful Barolo. In this context, next to a set of profound 1989s and Conterno’s own 1990s, the wine suffers a bit, but it is still magical juice. At some point in the future, the wine’s structural components are likely to dominate over the fruit, but that date appears to be well off in the future. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

1505,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barbera d'Alba Cascina Francia,"The 2007 Barbera d’Alba Cascina Francia flows onto the palate with waves of dark red fruit, sweet roses, licorice, flowers, menthol and tar, showing a remarkable combination of ripeness, clarity and detail. Medium in body, the wine offers tons of length and a refined, polished finish. Stylistically, the 2007 recalls the finesse and perfume of the 2004, with perhaps a touch more intensity and depth. Simply, put, this is as majestic a Barbera as readers are likely to find. Hard as it may seem to believe, this wine continues to get better with each passing vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2017. 

My recent visit to Giacomo Conterno was fascinating, as I had an opportunity to spend several hours tasting through all of the wines in barrel with proprietor Roberto Conterno. The question of succession is always an issue in small, family-run wineries, but this is one example where the younger generation is building on past success by taking things to an entirely new level. I can only imagine how proud Giovanni Conterno would be if he could see (and taste!) the sublime wines that have emerged from this property in recent years. Among the wines still in barrel, the most promising appear to be the 2002, 2004 and 2005 Monfortinos, all of which are spectacular at this stage. I also tasted Conterno’s first wines from his newly-acquired vineyard in Cerretta. The 2008s show a work in progress as Conterno only had control of the vineyard for a few months that year. It will be interesting to see what he comes up with going forward. In 2007, Conterno’s Barbera officially carries the Cascina Francia vineyard designation to differentiate it from a new single-vineyard Barbera from the Cerretta vineyard the estate will release beginning with the 2008 vintage. These two new releases from proprietor Roberto Conterno are stellar. This year there is no Monfortino, as the next vintage that is scheduled for release, the 2002, is still in barrel. Depending on one’s point of view, the lack of a new Monfortino might be good or bad news. I, for one, don’t mind a year without having to make the significant but very worthwhile investment acquiring these wines requires.

1506,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"The recently-bottled 2005 Barolo Cascina Francia is, as expected, somewhat closed down at this stage from an aromatic perspective. That said, it is impossible to ignore the wine’s richness and depth, both of which are impressive. With time in the glass hints of sweet roses, cherries, spices and tar emerge, all framed by impeccably silky tannins. As always, readers should taste this wine as soon as possible, as it will almost certainly head for a slumber during which it will be impossible to evaluate with any accuracy. Today, this mid-weight, graceful Barolo Cascina Francia looks to be accessible relatively early, which means around age 10-12 give or take. It is another superb Barolo from Giacomo Conterno. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2030.

1507,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barbera d'Alba Cascina Francia,"The 2006 Barbera d’Alba is a knockout. The aromatics alone are worth the price of admission. This rich, sumptuous Barbera tastes just like it did in barrel, which is to say plump, juicy and full of vibrant dark fruit. Notes of iron, tar and smoke that are typical of the Cascina Francia vineyard develop in the glass. The wine possesses stunning length and textural depth not to mention a finessed, harmonious personality. Stylistically it is also remarkably complete, as it combines the richness of fruit found in the 2003 with the greater perfume and finesse of the 2004 and 2005. It is not to be missed. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2016.

The biggest news at Giacomo Conterno over the last few months has been the estate’s recently completed acquisition of three hectares in the Cerretta vineyard in Serralunga. This is a significant development considering the winery’s history. Few estates in Italy are so closely identified with one piece of land as Giacomo Conterno. When Conterno purchased the Cascina Francia vineyard (a monopole) in 1974 it was a wheat field, although vines had been planted there in the past. There are no known pre-Conterno wines from Cascina Francia. Once the estate began making wines from Cascina Francia (first vintage 1978) they focused all of their attention on that vineyard and ceased using purchased fruit. Given all of the change in Piedmont over the last thirty-plus years it is hard to believe, but Conterno never acquired another parcel - until now. There are two hectares of Nebbiolo and one of Barbera which will become new, separate bottlings. Roberto Conterno told me it will be two to three years before the vineyard responds to the work he is doing today. Unfortunately 2008 has been a challenging growing season characterized by abundant rain in the spring and summer, along with hail, which damaged a portion of the fruit, so total production from Cerretta is expected to be small. Still, it will be fascinating to see what Conterno comes up with from their new vineyards in Cerretta. As for the new releases, they are drop-dead gorgeous. While some of these wines are increasingly difficult to afford, at the end of the day it is hard to begrudge the commercial success of one of Italy’s historic estates, which in many ways, has been a long time coming. The late Giovanni Conterno and his wife Yvonne made enormous sacrifices over the years. In 1974 they paid a princely sum for their Cascina Francia vineyard, then in the early 1980s they built their current winemaking facility, all while putting five children through school. Today Roberto Conterno makes wines that can hold their own with the very finest wines made anywhere in the world, and in that context theses Barolos remain fairly priced. This is an estate that has achieved its success the hard way, by earning it - not just over the years, but over the decades.

1508,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"The 2004 Barolo Cascina Francia is an explosive wine that faithfully captures all of the promise it showed from barrel. This spectacularly rich, concentrated Barolo possesses striking perfume in its smoke, tar, spiced red fruits, licorice and flowers. The wine offers tremendous length and a finish that lasts forever. This is an especially dense, powerful Cascina Francia with a gorgeous core of perfumed sweet fruit that will require some time to fully emerge but is breathtakingly beautiful even at this early stage.

1509,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barbera d'Alba Cascina Francia,"Conterno’s 2005 Barbera d’Alba Cascina Francia is a terrific effort. Its silky aromas meld seamlessly onto the palate, where vibrant layers of dark fruit come to life. As it sits in the glass, licorice, tar, smoke and mineral notes become more prominent, adding further complexity to this irresistibly sensual wine. Long, sweet and pure, it continued to evolve beautifully over the day I followed it. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2015. 

This is another set of superb releases from Giacomo Conterno one of the bastions of traditionally made Barolos. While Conterno’s wines have often been profound, in recent vintages the estate has found another level of finesse that was sometimes missing in the wines. It is hard to say if that is because of a general trend towards warmer vintages, the estate’s focus on making just three wines, or small improvements in vineyard and cellar work, but the fact remains that over the past few vintages Roberto Conterno has produced the best and most consistently outstanding wines in his venerable firm’s long history. The wines he has in barrel amply confirm this very positive trend.

1510,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"The 2003 Barolo Cascina Francia is a remarkable wine for the vintage. This deep, powerful Barolo reveals awesome richness and an almost liqueur-like quality to its fruit that is balanced by the chalky mineral notes that provide freshness on the finish and help convey an impression of notable balance. In 2003 there is no Monfortino, and the Cascina Francia surely benefits from the addition of that juice which is mostly felt in the wine’s depth. Resisting the temptation to harvest too early, Roberto Conterno waited until October 8 to start picking in his Cascina Francia vineyard, long after most producers had already brought the fruit in. He had the benefit of the late September rains that helped restore at least a little freshness to the fruit, and as a result his 2003 Cascina Francia doesn’t have the aggressive tannins that plague so many wines. Simply put, this is a stunning Barolo made all the more notable by the challenging conditions the vintage presented. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2023.

1512,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barbera d'Alba Cascina Francia,"Conterno’s 2003 Barbera d’Alba is easily one of the best wines of the vintage. A rich ruby, it offers intense ripe dark fruit, with suggestions of tar, smoke and licorice on a medium to full-bodied frame, while retaining a classic sense of proportion and enough freshness to provide balance. It comes across as less concentrated than when I last tasted it from cask. A great effort. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2013.

1513,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"The 1999 Barolo Riserva Monfortino takes things to another level, hard as that may be to believe. It is deeply expressive in its aromatics, with breathtaking nuances of roses, menthol, spices and licorice that emerge from the glass, melding seamlessly onto the palate where complex layers of dark ripe fruit captivate the taster in an endless counterpoint of aromas, flavors and sensations that are hard to fully capture with mere words. Boasting much intensity and a more full-bodied structure than the 1998, with building tannins that define the eternal finish, it is wine to taste now and over the next 6-9 months before it begins to shut down. Sampled from both bottle and magnum, it is a remarkable wine in every way, and is sure to take a place among the great Monfortinos of all time. Those fortunate enough to own Monfortinos from the recent string of vintages dating back to 1995 as well as the equally promising 2000 and 2001 will no doubt enjoy debating the merits of these remarkable wines for years and decades to come. The 1999 Monfortino remains one of the greatest young wines I have ever tasted. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2039.

Notes of mineral and leather gradually develop in the glass, adding further complexity as this great wine begins to reveal its expansive and profound personality. The 1998 is unusually open right now. As was the case with the 1997 at this stage, it should offer a brief drinking window over the next 6 months or so before shutting down for what is likely to be an extended period prior to awakening in the glorious prime of its life.

Enormously full and ripe, layered and textured with a richness which is almost indescribable, it truly has it all, the rose petals, tar, and licorice of the nose, the succulent density of the flavors, the endless finish which rises to a crescendo of sensual authority. Strangely enough, it is already approachable, even if it will undoubtedly be good for another quarter of a century. A last piece of good news is that the 1996 version of this wine, a work of art which seemed hewn out of granite, is finally beginning to soften, open up, and show its austere magnificence. Unlike the 1997, it is a wine I would not touch for another ten years but, as in the fable of the tortoise and the hare, it is entirely possible that the former beast will win the race.

Medium garnet (color is never particularly deep here), its spicy-resinous nose, warm, penetrating, and alcoholic, promises much pleasure, a commitment which the palate respects in its ample texture, superior continuity and drive, lovely kirsch and licorice flavors, and unusually supple tannins.

An usually dark garnet for a completely traditional Barolo, its fabulously fresh aromas, plummy and spicy and redolent of roses, violets, graphite, and road tar, give way to a super-concentrated palate, massive and packed, dense and intense in texture and continuity. It is explosive on the development and finish, both mouth-coating and chewy yet nobly austere and with the length and kick which characterize the greatest of Barolo. I would not touch a bottle until 2010, and imagine that it will still be an extraordinary wine in 2035.

1521,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"Fully mature for the past decade, the 1967 Barolo Monfortino is one of Conterno's great successes. For some reason, this wine has long been ignored when top-notch Monfortinos are discussed by wine lovers/aficionados. The 1967 reveals a mature, ruby/garnet color with considerable amber. The smoky, earthy bouquet offers up copious quantities of sweet tea and dried fruit aromas. There is a sweet, succulent, rich, fleshy mouth-feel with just enough acidity and tannin to provide delineation. Owners should not push their luck by holding this wine longer as it needs to be consumed.

1522,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"The 1964 Barolo Monfortino, which I decanted in Maryland before making the trek to Brooklyn, probably suffered from being drunk six hours after it had been opened and decanted. The wine reveals generous amounts of amber to the color, a lusty, seaweed, dried herb, spicy nose, but fading, fragile flavors. Some glycerin and exuberance remain, but this wine is past its plateau of maturity.

1523,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Cascina Francia,"Probably because of its recent bottling, the 1996 Barolo Cascina-Francia was subdued, but it does not appear to have the depth of a great vintage for this estate. The color is medium ruby with pink at the edge. Notes of balsam wood, spice box, tar, and rosewood reluctantly emerge from the aromatics. In the mouth, flavors of spice and leather compete with dusty cherry fruit in a tannic, austere, closed, steely style. I do not find enough sweetness, glycerin, or extract to make this profound, but it is very good to excellent. Anticipated maturity:  2008-2025.

1524,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"One of the great Barolo Monfortino's is the 1995, which I hope will be bottled and released before 2005. This was the finest wine I tasted in Conterno's cellars (everything between current releases and 2000). Significantly concentrated, it represents a tiny crop because of hail damage. The wine reveals the essence of licorice, kirsch, smoke, red currant and cherries, as well as the tell-tale rose petal and licorice notes. It is ripe and full-bodied, with sweet fruit, copious glycerin, and a seamless finish that lasts for nearly 45 seconds. As the wine sat in the glass, it became even more floral and concentrated. There is abundant tannin, and the wine will undoubtedly taste more structured when it is released. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2040.

1525,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barolo Riserva Monfortino,"The light garnet/ruby-colored 1993 Barolo Monfortino is undoubtedly the wine of the vintage for this challenging year. Like all Conterno wines, it was bottled without fining and filtration, thus preserving its full terroir and varietal characteristics. It boasts a knock-out aromatic profile of rose petals, tar, new saddle leather, sweet, jammy black cherries, licorice, and raspberries, decent acidity, sweet tannin, copious alcohol, wonderful density, a fleshy texture, and beautiful harmony as well as elegance. It can be drunk now and over the next 15 years. Look for this effort to be one of the great sleeper wines of Piedmont given the fact that most 1993 Barolos are austere and hard-edged.

1530,Domaine Henri Boillot,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 1996 Dolcetto d'Alba, which had 28 days of skin contact, is an out-sized, tannic, monster Dolcetto that needs time in the bottle. Most Dolcettos are meant to be drunk within the first 2-3 years of life, but Conterno's need 2-3 years of cellaring! While the 1996 possesses elegance and lovely berry fruit, the tannin level is excruciatingly high. It will last for 10-12 years.

The two most famous Conternos are Giacomo, who produces these wines, and his near-by neighbor, Aldo. Both are legends in Piedmont, with the wines of Giacomo Conterno about as traditional as can be found in our high-tech world.

1531,Domaine Henri Boillot,Barbera d'Alba,"I am not convinced by the 1996 Barbera d'Alba's balance. It reveals extremely high acidity (typical of Barbera), which translates into shrillness in the mouth. The moderately intense nose of strawberry fruit, rose petals, and spice is promising. The wine possesses weight and richness, but oh, the acidity. This wine should last easily for a decade.

Drink these huge, large-scaled, full-throttle Barolos over the next 20 years. The 1989 is slightly more supple than the 1988 because of the nature of the vintage.

Conterno, whose wines I have followed since the mid-sixties, is unquestionably the quintessential traditionalist when it comes to Barolo.  No concessions are made to modern day tastes.  Consequently, his wines are among the most concentrated, as well as the most rustic and tannic.  From time to time there have also been levels of volatile acidity that modern day technocrats would consider obscene, but which actually can add to the wine's complexity and character, up to a point. 

Because Giovanni Conterno is among the last to bottle his Barolos, I have reviewed his current and upcoming releases, including his 1987 and 1985 luxury cuvees of Barolo called Monfortino.  I should note that Conterno's 1989 Barolo Cascina Francia has been bottled and may be released sooner than normal.

The 1987 Monfortino is unquestionably the Barolo of the vintage.  Its saturated dark color and huge nose of truffles, tar, and sweet tobacco tinged with black-cherry fruit are followed by a wine with gobs of glycerin, amazing power and richness, and a monstrously long, tannic finish.  A great wine from a so-so vintage, it should be at its best between 1997-2020.  Those of you who love wine loaded with lavish new oak, sweet, crunchy fruit, and squeaky clean, simple flavors should be sure to taste this wine before you decide to buy.

Conterno's controversial Monfortino, which often spends 10-12 years in old wood before being bottled, can be a wine with as many flaws as assets.  However, even though this 1971 spent nearly eight years in wood, it does not suffer from the excessive levels of volatile acidity that plague vintages such as 1964 and 1967.  The wine has thrown less sediment than Conterno's 1971 Barolo-Reserva, but it must be decanted.  Even then it requires a steady hand so as not to lose 15% of the volume due to the thick crust at the bottom of the bottle.  The nose offers sensational aromas of saddle leather, dried cherry fruit, cedar, tobacco, and tar.  Exceptionally full-bodied and rich, as well as smoother and less tannic than Conterno's 1971 Barolo-Reserva, this flamboyant, powerful wine is the quintessential example of an old style Barolo.  Drinkable now, this wine should have no trouble lasting for another 10-15 years.",,RP 97

1971 is one of the great vintages for Piedmont and for Giovanni Conterno.  This Reserva selection has thrown considerable sediment, but the color is still a deep garnet/ruby/purple.  The intense fragrance of the bouquet reveals classic Barolo aromas of tar, roasted black-cherries, and earthy, truffle notes.  This young, powerful wine continues to exhibit gorgeous levels of rich, sweet Nebbiolo fruit buttressed by high acidity and mouthsearing tannins.  While approachable now, it is still unevolved.  Unlike many of Conterno's Barolos, there is no evidence of volatile acidity, and at age 21 this wine is set for another 10-20 years of cellaring.",,RP 97
