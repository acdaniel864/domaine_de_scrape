0,Prieure Roch,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Vieilles Vignes,"Prieuré-Roche's 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Vieilles Vignes is showing very well, bursting from the glass with a captivating bouquet of rose petals, peonies, cinnamon and raspberries. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and layered, its considerable endowment of fine tannin largely concealed by its ample core of succulent fruit, concluding with a long and precise finish.",,RP 93
1,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots is showing very well, wafting from the glass with a complex aromatic mélange of dark berry fruit, orange rind, peonies, cinnamon, smoked meats and rich spices that are framed by a nicely integrated application of new oak and strongly recall the wines of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and muscular, with powdery tannins that assert themselves more and more prominently the longer the wine sits in the glass, good concentration at the core and ripe but lively acids. This Suchots is still a few years away from attaining its plenitude, but its quality is already apparent.",,RP 93
2,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières offers lovely rustic red cherry and black plum scents on the nose, a touch of Earl Grey tea developing in the glass, all with impressive delineation. The palate is lifted on the entry with a slight biscuit-like note infusing the red fruit. Tart red cherries, brown spices, a touch of cooked meat towards the finish complete this well-crafted Vosne-Romanée that should give several years drinking pleasure. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 93
3,Prieure Roch,"Bourgogne ""Pinoterie""","The 2011 Bourgogne ""Pinoterie"" comes from naughty berries that detached themselves from the stems on the sorting table, Prieuré-Roch being militant about their whole bunch vinification. These are collected together from the domaine's holdings and blended to form this cuvée. It has a brisk, slightly leafy bouquet (in fact, you might think a few stems found their way into the vat!). The palate is well balanced with light tannin, an easy-drinking Pinot Noir with tart red cherries, tapering towards a light finish. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 93
4,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Vosne-Romanée Haut Maizières 1999 is a deeply impressive wine from Domaine Prieure-Roch, especially considering this is not a premier cru vineyard. It has a dense redcurrant, raspberry and crushed rose-petal bouquet that is quite backward considering that it already has 15 years or so in bottle. The palate is powerful, quite muscular at first with a fine line of acidity and then with aeration it achieves more and more finesse, especially on the multilayered and pure finish. It actually deserves another three or four years in bottle. Wow.",,RP 93
5,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a ridiculously fine village cru for the vintage. It has a cohesive and focused bouquet with smoke, sea salt and a scent of bracken that lends real personality. After 10-15 minutes, it develops a slight graphite note that lends it masculinity. The palate is medium-bodied with a sensual opening that belies what are very fine tannins. The acidity here is extremely well-judged with a lovely dash of spice toward the peacock tail finish. After one hour, this wine is really opening with panache and style, so I recommend a couple of hours decanting or further bottle age. Wonderful. Drink 2016-2026.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
6,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2008 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a little lean and herbaceous on the nose and already shows some age on the rim. There is a slight vegetal tincture that becomes less prominent with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with soft, fleshy fruit, but it is missing some depth and structure toward the seaweed-tinged finish. This was a curious showing. Drink now-2017.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
7,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2007 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte initially has what you might describe as a funky nose, slightly bretty at first, although that seems to clear with an hour in the glass to reveal some ripe Morello cherry and wild strawberry scents. There is also a stemminess in situ, although that ebbs away with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with fine crisp tannins – a structured Le Clos Goillotte with more matiere than the previous vintage. This improves in the glass and evolves a lovely cohesive ferrous finish. This is very fine, but I would give it another two years in bottle. Drink 2016-2026+.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
8,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2006 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a slightly diffuse and leathery bouquet that compared to other vintages seems rather dour. The palate is tart on the entry with slightly rasping acidity, foursquare and masculine, and lacking a little substance for the first hour or so, although returning later it does coalesce and gain more weight. This is a mercurial Le Clos Goillotte that changes dramatically in the glass but never reaches the heights of other vintages. Drink now-2018.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
9,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2005 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a deep purple hue. The nose offers attractive dark cherries, red plum and a touch of sous-bois, a marine influence becoming more prominent with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with pure cranberry and cassis notes on the entry, tobacco just tangible underneath. There is good structure here although, like many 2005s, the wine remains backward, and is missing a little persistency on the finish. Returning after 30 minutes there is an attractive bacon fat/Italian cured meat note infusing the aromatics and it seems to stretch its wings and manifest more vigor. This is a lovely 2005 Vosne-Romanee but afford it an hour’s decanting. Drink now-2020.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
10,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"Served from magnum, the 2001 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a very commendable wine for the vintage. It has an attractive fungal, sous-bois-scented bouquet with a touch of blueberry and wild mint. After 13 years, this is still fresh and has a pleasing purity. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins and crisp acidity, with bitter red cherries defining the finish. What a splendid wine for the vintage. Drink now-2019.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
11,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2000 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a slightly bretty nose with sous-bois and Provencal herbs dominating, later some wild fennel and broom. The palate is showing a touch of underripeness and there is some volatile acidity masking the finish. This feels as if it would have been better several years ago, but here it is clearly surpassed by the 2001. Drink now. Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
12,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"Tasted from magnum, the 1999 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is initially a little scrawny both on the nose and the palate, but don’t be fooled – it’s just toying with you. Observing the wine over two hours, it coalesces on the nose with scents of red berries, iron rust, chestnut and Provencal herbs – fully mature but divine. The palate similarly seems to be at its peak, but there is certainly good substance here with marmalade, bay leaf and leather infusing the degraded red fruit. There is something autumnal about this Clos Goillotte, but with aeration it certainly still gives much pleasure. I would be more cautious with respect to 750ml examples. Drink now-2017.  Tasted June 2014.",,RP 93
13,Prieure Roch,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 1996 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is dominated by excessive brettanoymces on the nose that obscures any sense of terroir or fruit concentration. The palate seems ripe on the entry, but there is that distinct sweatiness that even for someone like myself who can abide brettanomyces, is just too much. Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
14,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Vieilles Vignes,"Prieuré-Roche's 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Vieilles Vignes is showing very well, bursting from the glass with a captivating bouquet of rose petals, peonies, cinnamon and raspberries.

22,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2005 Richebourg Grand Cru marks the transition to the domaine's contemporary style, wafting from the glass with a rich and fruit-driven bouquet of cassis, plums and black raspberries that's framed by a lavish application of creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, dense and concentrated, with a deep and fleshy profile that's still quite wrapped up in its fine-grained tannic chassis, buttressed by tangy acids. In its impactful, modernist style it's quite a success, though it's still several years away from prime-time drinking.",,RP 93
23,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2004 Richebourg Grand Cru is dominated by the green, herbal aromas that characterize this vintage at its worst. While I know plenty of tasters who are even more intolerant of such qualities than I, the wine was nevertheless hard to love.",,RP 93
24,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2003 Richebourg Grand Cru is in fact showing better than the 2002 in its rich, ripe, oaky style, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of dark chocolate, plums and cola, framed by creamy new wood. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with low acids and a long, oak-inflected finish. It could pass for a wine from the Russian River Valley, but it is holding up well.",,RP 93
25,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2002 Richebourg Grand Cru was disappointing, offering up a bouquet that mingles Asian spices and dark chocolate with notions of smoked meats and figgy fruit tones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied and surprisingly drying and firm in a vintage that's so often characterized by a pure, succulent and indeed almost crystalline expression of fruit. Dare I suggest that its best days are already in the rearview mirror?",,RP 93
26,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Anne Gros's 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is showing well, unfurling in the glass with a still-youthful bouquet of creamy dark berry fruit, spices, plums and toasty new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and layered, with a remarkably primary core of fruit, fine but gently chewy structuring tannins and ripe but lively acids. This is a strong effort in quite the comparatively oaky, extracted style that's so typical of this decade in the Côte de Nuits, my sole reservation being that it's a little short on complexity for a 20-year-old Richebourg.",,RP 93
27,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1998 Richebourg Grand Cru likely made for quite dramatic drinking in its youth, but today, it comes across as rather stylized, its aromas of dark cassis fruit competing with lavish applications of toasty new oak that contribute prominent aromas of caramel, vanilla and spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and ample but not terribly harmonious, with unresolved oak tannins poking out on the back end. This was a challenging vintage, of course, but the 1996 Richebourg has not aged especially gracefully.",,RP 93
28,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Fontanilles,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault and Carignan, the 2014 Minervois Les Fontanilles is a gorgeous, youthful, medium-bodied effort that has terrific freshness in its raspberry, crushed flower and mineral-laced bouquet. Coming from the grey clay and limestone soils beside the estate, it has solid mid-palate depth, ripe tannin and a lively, balanced style that will evolve nicely over the coming decade.",,RP 91
29,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,IGP Pays d’Herault La Grenache 8,"Readers looking for a Burgundian expression of Grenache need look no further than the 2014 IGP Pays d’Herault La Grenache 8. Completely destemmed and aged in tank, it’s purple/blue color is followed by searing minerality, licorice, crushed flowers and lavender, and this beauty continues to open up nicely with time in the glass. Mouth-filling, very young and almost tasting like a barrel sample, it has savory tannin and a clean, focused finish. It should be better in a year and drink well through 2024.",,RP 91
30,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,IGP Pays d’Herault Les Combettes,"Possessing a terrific bouquet of licorice, black and blue fruits and violets, the 2014 IGP Pays d’Hérault Les Combettes is 100% Marselan (this variety is a mix of Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon) that was completely destemmed and aged 12 months in barrels.  About as elegant and seamless as this variety gets, this medium-bodied effort has a seamless texture, no hard edges and smokin’ purity of fruit, all of which allow it to drink nicely today, yet should also allow it to evolve gracefully. I don’t see any need to delay gratification, but I’m sure this will keep for 5-6 years, if not longer.",,RP 91
31,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,IGP Pays d’Herault La Cinso,"The 2014 IGP Pays d’Herault La Cinso is 100% Cinsault was raised all in tank. Its vibrant ruby/purple color is followed by attractive notes of raspberries, crushed flowers, violets and hints of dusty earthy. These give way to a medium-bodied, elegant and seamless wine that shows the hallmark purity and elegance of the estate. It should drink nicely for 4-5 years.",,RP 91
32,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois 50 / 50,"A crunchy, vibrant and fresh style, the 2014 Minervois 50 / 50 has morphed from an even split of Syrah and Grenache to include a splash of Carignan. It reveals a vibrant purple color as well as fresh notes of spring flowers, plums, violets and black cherries. Medium-bodied, elegant and with light tannin, it shines for its terrific purity of fruit and clean finish. Drink it anytime over the coming 5-6 years.",,RP 91
33,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois l’O de Vie,"Sporting a vibrant purple color as well as notes of violets, black and blue fruits, licorice and peppery herbs, the 2014 Minervois l’O de Vie is medium-bodied, very fresh, lively and balanced. Like all of the 2014s here, it shines more for its purity and elegance, more so than its richness and power. Enjoy this solid red over the coming 5-6 years.",,RP 91
34,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru, from 75- and 50-year-old vines, has a crisp and poised bouquet with blackberry and blueberry, wonderful mineralité here and great precision, with the oak neatly dovetailed into the fruit. The palate is precise and structured. There is a superb backbone here; this is very focused and a more masculine, linear Richebourg. There is a sense aristocracy here with great sustain on the finish. Give it a decade before broaching, as I suspect it will end up in the top of my banded score. ",,RP 91
35,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is more expressive and open on the nose compared to the Echézeaux with dark cherries, blueberry and blackcurrant scents that are succinct and detailed. There is more fruité here at the moment and well defined. The palate is knitted together nicely by the veneer of new oak, but underneath is plenty of mineral-rich, black fruit. This is a structured Clos Vougeot, just a tad introspective but very nicely focused with an elegant, quite sustained finish. This is one of the best Clos de Vougeot that I came across during my tastings.",,RP 91
36,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Vignerondes,"Anne Gros is the present guardian of six barrels of a 2014 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Vignerondes that were auctioned by the Hospices de Nuits. It has a ripe, raspberry coulis and wild strawberry-scented bouquet with a light marine influence. The palate is rounded and generous on the entry, Anne's racking in used barrel tempering the oak influence, revealing lovely mineral tones towards the finish. This is a really quite adorable Nuits-Saint-Georges. ",,RP 91
37,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a clean and very precise bouquet: nicely focused with palpable mineralité even at this early juncture, hints of briary and griottes emerging with time. It is a succinct nose, detailed and not showy at all. The palate has a detailed entry with fine, quite firm tannins. This is linear and precise, a little grainy in texture with a healthy dose of white pepper furnishing the finish. It will need 5-7 years in bottle before it is ready to go. It just does not quite have the depth and body that others have shown.",,RP 91
38,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Nuits St Georges les Damodes,"The rarely seen 2014 Nuits St Georges les Damodes has an elegant raspberry and violet-scented bouquet, quite Vosne-Romanée in style. The palate is fleshy on the entry with fine tannin, impressive mineralité and a poised, very elegant finish. Is this really just a village cru!? Worth seeking out (although readers should note that this cuvée is not exported to the United States). ",,RP 91
39,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vosne Romanee les Barreaux,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée les Barreaux comes from vines that actually neighbor those of Les Varoilles lieu-dit in Richebourg. It has a stoic, slightly earthy nose at first, nicely defined, with a faint marine influence coming through. The palate is well balanced with juicy red and black fruit, not overly complex but with appreciable succulence on the easy going finish.",,RP 91
40,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Chambolle Musigny la Combe d'Orveaux,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny la Combe d'Orveau is back, back, back after being hailed off last year. It has a tightly wound bouquet with blackberry, wet limestone and briary scents, more Morey in style than Chambolle perhaps. The palate is crisp and taut on the entry, quite terse and backward; this is a broody Chambolle with a brisk, very linear finish. It should gain more flesh by the time of bottling, but it might still be convalescing from the trauma of 2013.",,RP 91
41,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Bourgogne,"From 50-year-old vines in three different vineyards towards the Vosne-Romanée appellation, the 2014 Bourgogne Rouge has a lovely floral bouquet in the making, one that is already charming. The palate is showing just a touch of rigidity on the entry. However, there is a keen line of acidity with commendable structure on the chalky finish. This is worth checking out. ",,RP 91
42,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Cotes de Nuits Cuvee Marine Blanc,"The 2014 Hautes Cote de Nuits Blanc Cuvée Marine Blanc has a light peach skin bouquet that is nicely defined, a touch of pear developing with aeration. The palate has a twist of sour lemon on the entry, that peachiness coming through towards the poised, tensile finish. This is a perfectly respectable Hautes Côte de Nuits Blanc. ",,RP 91
43,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Cotes de Nuits,"The 2014 Hautes Cote de Nuits Rouge has a crisp, high-toned bouquet with blueberry and blackcurrant notes that are detailed and open nicely in the glass. The palate is well balanced, a little hardness on the entry, the acidity crisp with a slightly austere finish that will hopefully flesh out by the time of bottling. ",,RP 91
44,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at Fine & Rare Wines' Clos Vougeot tasting, the 2013 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru from Anne Gros has a comparatively intense bouquet compared to its peers, with black cherries and red plum, rose petals and orange blossom. The palate is medium-bodied with good fruit intensity, but the oak feels a little strong and there is a dustiness on the finish that deprives it of the precision it might have had. This feels like a good Clos Vougeot that has been a little compromised in the winery, though perhaps it will settle down with continued bottle age, as Anne's wines are prone to do. ",,RP 91
45,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2001 Richebourg Grand Cru from Anne Gros has a well defined, comparatively voluptuous nose thanks to the layering of new oak, but the wood is enmeshed within the fruit and maintains a very sensual purity, not masking the pinoté as I suspect it did in its formative years. The aromatics need time to open, but it is worth the wait. The palate is medium-bodied, very well balanced, supple and rounded - a texture that belies the backbone and structure within. It is a plush take on Richebourg, a style synonymous with Anne Gros, and here it works extremely well, especially considering that 2001 was not a top-grade Burgundy vintage. Chapeau Anne!",,RP 91
46,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Carretals,"One of the greatest wine yet from Anne, the incredible 2013 Minervois les Carretals is a blend of Carignan (from vines planted in 1909) and Grenache that's brought up all in French oak. It exhibits thrilling notes of black raspberry, liquid violets, salty minerality and hints of licorice to go with an ultra-pure, elegant, medium to full-bodied feel on the palate. Given the overall purity and quality of the texture, it's hard to resist now, yet I think it will be even better in another year or two, and evolve easily through 2025.",,RP 91
47,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Fontanilles,"Another wine that I think is the best to date, the single vineyard 2013 Minervois les Fontanilles comes from sandstone and limestone soils and 25-year-old vines of Syrah and Grenache, and 50-year-old vines of Cinsault and Carignan. The Cinsault and Grenache are brought up in tank, and the Syrah and Carignan in demi-muid. This classic beauty has drop dead gorgeous notes of creme de cassis, black raspberry, caramelized cherries, vanilla bean and a saline-like minerality. Medium to full-bodied, fine, elegant and seamless, with incredible purity, this classy Minervois can be consumed now, or cellared for 5-7 years.",,RP 91
48,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois la Ciaude,"Another single parcel release, the 2013 Minervois la Ciaude comes from the clay and rocky soils around the town of Cazelles and is mostly Carignan (100+-year-old vines) and Syrah, yet incorporates a splash of Grenache. Aged mostly in demi-muids, it has lots of liquid minerality to go with classic notes of black raspberry, violets, spice and hints of toasted bread. Balanced, elegant and medium-bodied, with perfectly integrated acidity and ample balancing fruit, it too can be consumed anytime over the coming decade.",,RP 91
49,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vin de France La 8 Grenache,"A new cuvee, the 2013 Vin de France La 8 Grenache is a stunner that was aged in 1-3-year-old barrels before being bottled in November of 2014. It delivers terrific notes of ripe black and red raspberry, licorice and crushed flowers to go with building richness, medium-bodied depth and a seamless, pure style on the palate. This is Grenache at its most elegant and finesse driven, yet it still offers beautiful texture and richness. Drink it anytime over the coming decade.",,RP 91
50,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vin de France l'O de la Vie,"Meaning ""The Water of Life"", the 2013 Vin de France l'O de la Vie comes from 6-year-old vines and offers a forward, soft, supple and beautifully fruited profile to go with lots of salty minerality, violets, pepper and juicy, berry-like fruit. It's the finest vintage of this cuvee to date and is ideal for drinking over the coming 4-5 years.",,RP 91
51,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vin de France Cinso,"There's roughly 8,000 bottles of the 2013 Vin de France Cinso, and it's an elegant, medium-bodied effort that has an almost Pinot Noir like sensibility to it delicate raspberry, strawberry and floral scented bouquet. Medium-bodied, seamless and forward, it's a beautiful wine that's ideal for drinking over the coming 3-4 years. This gains depth and length with time in the glass, and is downright pretty.",,RP 91
52,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois 50 / 50,"I think the most straightforward of the new releases, the inky colored 2013 Minervois 50 / 50 is a blend of 40-45% Grenache and the balance an even split of Syrah and Carignan. It's a medium-bodied, elegant and forward effort that has pretty purple fruits, crushed violets, pepper and hints of leather. Drink it over the coming 3-4 years.",,RP 91
53,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois la Ciaude,"We finished the tasting with an older vintage of the la Ciaude. Like the 2013, the 2010 Minervois la Ciaude comes from a single parcel of rocky, clay soils and old vines of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. Deep, rich and textured, with superb concentration in its raspberry, violets and mineral-laced style, it opens up beautifully in the glass, has excellent mid-palate depth, medium to full-bodied richness and a seamless texture. Slightly deeper and richer than the 2013, yet not quite as polished or pure, this beauty is still youthful, and will continue to drink nicely through 2022.",,RP 91
54,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a broody, almost curmudgeonly bouquet at first: blackberry, undergrowth, black plum and just a suggestion of hoisin all very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, black truffle and a touch of dried lemon peel; quite austere and distant toward the finish at the moment. It will need several years in bottle and one hopes it will be less...moody! ",,RP 91
55,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a tightly wound rose-petal bouquet that is nicely defined with touches of forest floor developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, more masculine than other Echézeaux ‘13s that I have encountered from barrel with good backbone. Stern, maybe a bit aloof, this constitutes a ""serious"" grand cru that just needs to let its hair down (a bit).  ",,RP 91
56,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc,"The 2013 Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc, which was not as affected by botrytis as the red, has a clean and fresh lime flower and dried honey-scented bouquet that is well defined and offers good vigor. The palate is fresh with good acidity, a slightly waxy texture and a tickle of spice on the finish. What a lovely wine - one that strangely reminds me of a white Bordeaux!",,RP 91
57,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Damodes,"From purchased grapes, the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges les Damodes has a fine blackberry and briary bouquet that gently unfolds in the glass, forest-floor notes dominating. The palate is medium-bodied with a saline tang: gritty tannin and satisfying definition on the finish, even if it needs more persistence. Enjoy this over the next 4-6 years.",,RP 91
58,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge has an attractive bouquet, quite floral but it takes around five minutes to really get going. The palate is medium-bodied with taut, slightly chalky tannin and an appealing blackberry and cranberry finish. Sure, it's just a bit ephemeral, but it will give two or three year's easy-drinking pleasure.",,RP 91
59,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Côtes de Nuits,"The 2013 Hauts Cotes de Nuits Rouge has a slightly muted bouquet. The palate is crisp with dark berry fruit, slightly autumnal with crisp acidity and a light, pointed blackberry finish. Like the Bourgogne Rouge it is missing a little substance at the moment but maybe it will put on some weight by bottling?",,RP 91
60,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Carretals,"My favorite of the 2012s, the 2012 Minervois Les Carretals (named after the vineyard where it comes from) offers deep, layered aromas and flavors of cassis and crunchy dark fruits, licorice, vanilla bean and searing minerality. Medium to full-bodied, concentrated, structured and age-worthy, it will take 2-3 years for this to round into form and it will have a solid 10-12 years or more of total longevity.

While I hate to use the term Burgundian here, these efforts certainly have a tension and energetic feel (while not lacking fruit) that’s unique to the region.

61,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Fontanilles,"A more serious effort, the 2012 Minervois Les Fontanilles is a knockout blend of Syrah, Grenache, Carignan and Cinsault that has the Syrah and Carignan aged in barrel and the balance in tank. Coming from sandstone and limestone soils, it offers vibrant blue fruits, crushed flowers, big minerality and pepper to go with an energetic, medium-bodied, elegant profile on the palate. I love the overall purity here and while tight and slightly reserved at present, it should evolve gracefully and drink well for over a decade.

70,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois 50 / 50,"Moving to the 2011s, this warmer year has added a smidge more texture and overall depth to the wines, and in general, it’s a more successful vintage here. Having said that, the 2011 Minervois 50 / 50 is maybe not the best example of this. While it has more up-front and rounded fruit and texture, it shows a rustic edge to its tannin, and I like the overall purity and focus of the 2012 more. Nevertheless, this tank-aged blend of old-vine Carignan and Cinsault (some Grenache) offers plenty of character and will drink nicely over the coming couple of years.

After modest success with her 2011s, it was great to come back to this domaine to find eternally youthful pixie-like Anne Gros back on form with a gaggle of gorgeous 2012s. Anne, the cousin of Bernard, Michel and Anne-Francoise, is one of the most conscientious winemakers I know, somebody who lives for her family, whether that is her three children or her vines. She exacts a meticulous picking, which in 2012 commenced on 21 September and lasted over three weeks until the 15 October up in her “Hautes Cotes” vines. I have written several times about this domaine, which I visited on my first Burgundy trip back in 1997. They have a slightly modern sheen like her cousin Bernard Gros, but here they are slightly more nuanced and terroir-driven. Quantities are small and sought after, and in 2012 her piece de resistance might not be the Richebourg, rather one of the best Clos de Vougeot wines of the vintage. But do not ignore either her excellent Hautes Cotes de Nuits white or red (or indeed her superb joint venture with partner Jean-Paul Tollot down in sunny Minnervois.)

The palate is crisp and vibrant on the entry with blood orange infusing the dark cherry and blackcurrant fruit, with fine precision on the almost understated but classy finish.

I have long admired the wines of Anne Gros where I have been visiting since the late 1990s, before I ever put pen to paper, so to speak. She has always been a typical Burgundian, preferring to stay in and around Vosne with her husband, Jean-Paul Tollot, and their three children. Years ago, she spoke of her dislike of travelling abroad. But Burgundy has changed and become more international. Anne has changed too, since she was in Hong Kong when I came by, so it was her daughter Julie who guided me through the wines-having just started working with her mother in recent months. Some commentators have criticized Anne’s wines for leaning too far toward new oak, though I myself have found them to handle the wood and absorb it well once the wines are allowed to age. But I have to confess, I did find the use of 100% new oak suppressed and occasionally overwhelmed the fruit in these 2011s. The usual exuberance may have been diminished by bottle shock, but I worry that some of these wines did not show the requisite weight of fruit to handle that amount of oak. It is nothing to do with the winemaking, but rather the limitations imposed by the growing season.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins on the entry. The acidity is nicely judged and it has an elegant finish with just a touch of spice. Drink now-2018.

81,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vosne-Romanée Les Barreaux,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee Les Barreaux is showing some unresolved new oak on the nose at the moment and needs another 12 months to fully integrate. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly rustic opening. The acidity is quite sharp here and shows just a little attenuation toward the finish. This is for early drinking compared to other vintages that I have tasted in the past. 

I have long admired the wines of Anne Gros where I have been visiting since the late 1990s, before I ever put pen to paper, so to speak. She has always been a typical Burgundian, preferring to stay in and around Vosne with her husband, Jean-Paul Tollot, and their three children. Years ago, she spoke of her dislike of travelling abroad. But Burgundy has changed and become more international. Anne has changed too, since she was in Hong Kong when I came by, so it was her daughter Julie who guided me through the wines-having just started working with her mother in recent months. Some commentators have criticized Anne’s wines for leaning too far toward new oak, though I myself have found them to handle the wood and absorb it well once the wines are allowed to age. But I have to confess, I did find the use of 100% new oak suppressed and occasionally overwhelmed the fruit in these 2011s. The usual exuberance may have been diminished by bottle shock, but I worry that some of these wines did not show the requisite weight of fruit to handle that amount of oak. It is nothing to do with the winemaking, but rather the limitations imposed by the growing season.

82,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Côtes de Nuits,"The 2011 Haut Cote de Nuits Rouge, which comes from the same plot as the white, has a clean fresh red currant and raspberry bouquet. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannins, attractive tart cherry fruit and pleasing weight on the nonchalant finish. Fine. Drink now.

The palate is medium-bodied with a supple opening: clean red berries, citrus lemon with a slightly abrupt but balanced finish. Fine. Drink now-2017.

85,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2011 Bourgogne Rouge is a blend of four parcels on the plane between Nuits St. Georges and Vosne-Romanee. It has a very floral bouquet that needs to show a little more restraint. The palate is medium-bodied with edgy tannins on the entry. It would benefit from a little more flesh on the entry and perhaps the Haut Cote de Nuits Rouge is actually showing a little more complexity. Drink now.

86,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Fontanilles,"A pre-assemblage approximation to the Gros-Tollot 2010 Minervois Les Fontanilles displays a gorgeous, bittersweet floral bouquet incorporating iris and gentian, allied to ripe but vividly bright black fruits and a scent of sea breeze. High-toned suggestions of almond extract and distilled herbal elixir add riveting complexity. A saliva-inducing salinity lends the finish here invigoration as well as the compulsion to take the next sip. This wine's combination of sweet ripeness with vivacity and the tendency toward nut extracts and distillate-like esters are characteristic for the striking 2010 material at this address. 

Anne Gros of the eponymous Vosne-Romanee domaine and her partner Jean-Paul Tollot (of Domaine Tollot-Beaut) happened on the site of their new estate not long after they conceived the possibility of working vineyards in the South, and Anne says that as soon as she grasped the diversity of soils and glimpsed the several substantial parcels on offer around tiny Cazelles - 14 hectares at the high, northern edge of appellation Minervois just before it gives way to Saint-Chinian (at the same elevation as Vosne-Romanee's crus), where nights are generally cool even in mid-summer - she was smitten. Gros and Tollot have since taken to the task of preserving the ancient vines and vineyard ecosystems in this neighborhood with born-again zeal. The Gros-Tollot family of four now lives and works here most weekends, although during the protracted picking of these sites so dramatically different in soil, exposure, and cepage - a harvest which overlaps that of the Cote d'Or - they can literally be pulled in two directions. Given this couple's background and well-known talents, it comes as no surprise to learn that they are rendering wines unlike any others in Minervois, or indeed anywhere else in the Languedoc. Their aims are inter alia to showcase each of their principle grape varieties - very much including unjustly-slighted Cinsault and Carignan; each of their soil types - sandstone and iron-rich chalk-clay; and elegance, levity, and refinement, vinous virtues that, yes, might well be dubbed Burgundian. The prices of top cuvees emanating from Gros and Tollot's new, extremely sophisticated facility (much of its equipment mirroring that at Domaine Anne Gros in Vosne) also set them apart from all but a handful of Languedoc collections, in which respect Gros openly expresses her disappointment that trade resistance has forced her to lower her sights a bit, quite possibly beneath price levels that will be sustainable long-term given the low yields and innovative, labor-and capital-intensive viticultural efforts that characterize the Gros-Tollot regimen. (Example: there are three different tractors to accommodate the widths of rows and method of vine-training in different parcels.) One might argue that Gros was naive about consumers' expectations of Minervois vis-a-vis famous-name Burgundy. But it is the trade and consumers who ultimately must shed prejudice and recognize good value, unique personalities, and exciting innovations in wine when they taste them - otherwise the market will dictate that quality like that of these wines no longer issues from the Languedoc, notwithstanding their eloquent testimony to what is possible. The Gros-Tollot La 50/50 represents tank-vinified fruits of old vines Carignan and Cinsault with those of some younger Grenache. Les Fontanilles is from a north- and west-facing, densely garrigue-rimmed bowl of predominantly ultra-friable sandstone but at places stony calcaire, planted with Grenache (in the majority), Cinsault, Syrah, and centenarian Carignan, fruits of the latter two sorts being matured in aged barriques. From south-facing but water-retentive limestone and all four cepages - though Syrah is dominant - La Ciaude is raised entirely in barrel; as is Les Carretals, from largely centenarian, dominantly Carignan vines in a near-clos whose lime-, iron-, and clay-rich soil reminds Gros of her parcel of Richebourg - except that this site is extraordinarily rocky by any standards whatsoever. After three years of rigorous de-budding, notes Gros, her younger vines seem now to have begun regulating themselves and producing a smaller, balanced crop. Incidentally, the inaugural 2008 collection here gained in charm and complexity during the nearly 12 month interval between the two occasions when I tasted it. Whereas the 2009s - harvested on average two weeks later than the 2008s and bottled last November - kicked into malo directly out of their primary fermentations, malo-lactic transformation of the 2010s was - in typically Burgundian fashion - delayed until spring, so my notes on wines of that vintage encompass the occasional lot with residual malic acid or significant residual CO2. I did however deem my note on one wine representative enough to be worth publishing as a foretaste of what is to come. Although there was no drought stress or desiccation here in 2010, Gros reports that she and Tollot were nonetheless amazed on pressing to realize how low was the juice-to-skin ratio as well as the pH, all of which one tastes as vibrant concentration, not to mention sees in wines whose deep colors belie their sense of levity and elegance.

87,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Carretals,"Fresh, tart-edged dark cherry, blackberry and mulberry characterize the Gros-Tollot 2009 Minervois Les Carretals, along with high-toned allusions to kirsch and fruit distillates in general. Lush and glycerin-rich, this nevertheless preserves the sense of lift and vivacity that are hallmarks of wines from this estate. Notes of resinous herbs, piquant cherry pit, cardamom, and crushed stone add counterpoint - and a sense of veal stock richness mouthwatering savor - to an expansive and imposingly-long if faintly warm finish. This sumptuous yet uplifting cuvee will I suspect be worth following for more than a decade.

88,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois la Ciaude,"Suggestions of toasted walnut and hickory along with violets, lilac, and hints of vanilla and resin from toasted oak all compliment the rich dark berries displayed in Gros and Tollot's 2009 Minervois La Ciaude. This is another example of plush texture and seamless ripeness allied to a welcome sense of finishing levity and energy such as can by no means be taken for granted from the vintage in question. I suspect this will merit the better part of a decade's attention, though of course a track record for the wines of this domaine is not yet established.

90,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois 50 / 50,"Gros and Tollot's 2009 La 50/50 was the sole somewhat disappointing wine in my tastings at this new estate. A spinach-like leafy and nutty note allied to fresh blackberry and cassis informs a sappy palate, while high-toned hints of maraschino waft throughout. The finishing impression here is pretty but just a tad warm and less persistent than its fellows.

91,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Carretals,"Gros and Tollot's 2008 Minervois Les Carretals offers a compelling combination of richness, textural refinement, levity, and energy. Burley tobacco, blackberry, cassis, rosemary oil tweak the nose and stain the palate, informing a satin-textured, palpably extract-rich, viscous, yet at the same time buoyant and vibrant matrix. As with so many of the most successful wines from this new estate, a high-toned, esterous suggestion of distilled fruits, herbs, and flowers shadows this all the way through its gripping yet at the same time soaring and exhilarating finish. I feel sure that it will fascinate and delight for more than a decade. 

Anne Gros of the eponymous Vosne-Romanee domaine and her partner Jean-Paul Tollot (of Domaine Tollot-Beaut) happened on the site of their new estate not long after they conceived the possibility of working vineyards in the South, and Anne says that as soon as she grasped the diversity of soils and glimpsed the several substantial parcels on offer around tiny Cazelles - 14 hectares at the high, northern edge of appellation Minervois just before it gives way to Saint-Chinian (at the same elevation as Vosne-Romanee's crus), where nights are generally cool even in mid-summer - she was smitten. Gros and Tollot have since taken to the task of preserving the ancient vines and vineyard ecosystems in this neighborhood with born-again zeal. The Gros-Tollot family of four now lives and works here most weekends, although during the protracted picking of these sites so dramatically different in soil, exposure, and cepage - a harvest which overlaps that of the Cote d'Or - they can literally be pulled in two directions. Given this couple's background and well-known talents, it comes as no surprise to learn that they are rendering wines unlike any others in Minervois, or indeed anywhere else in the Languedoc. Their aims are inter alia to showcase each of their principle grape varieties - very much including unjustly-slighted Cinsault and Carignan; each of their soil types - sandstone and iron-rich chalk-clay; and elegance, levity, and refinement, vinous virtues that, yes, might well be dubbed Burgundian. The prices of top cuvees emanating from Gros and Tollot's new, extremely sophisticated facility (much of its equipment mirroring that at Domaine Anne Gros in Vosne) also set them apart from all but a handful of Languedoc collections, in which respect Gros openly expresses her disappointment that trade resistance has forced her to lower her sights a bit, quite possibly beneath price levels that will be sustainable long-term given the low yields and innovative, labor-and capital-intensive viticultural efforts that characterize the Gros-Tollot regimen. (Example: there are three different tractors to accommodate the widths of rows and method of vine-training in different parcels.) One might argue that Gros was naive about consumers' expectations of Minervois vis-a-vis famous-name Burgundy. But it is the trade and consumers who ultimately must shed prejudice and recognize good value, unique personalities, and exciting innovations in wine when they taste them - otherwise the market will dictate that quality like that of these wines no longer issues from the Languedoc, notwithstanding their eloquent testimony to what is possible. The Gros-Tollot La 50/50 represents tank-vinified fruits of old vines Carignan and Cinsault with those of some younger Grenache. Les Fontanilles is from a north- and west-facing, densely garrigue-rimmed bowl of predominantly ultra-friable sandstone but at places stony calcaire, planted with Grenache (in the majority), Cinsault, Syrah, and centenarian Carignan, fruits of the latter two sorts being matured in aged barriques. From south-facing but water-retentive limestone and all four cepages - though Syrah is dominant - La Ciaude is raised entirely in barrel; as is Les Carretals, from largely centenarian, dominantly Carignan vines in a near-clos whose lime-, iron-, and clay-rich soil reminds Gros of her parcel of Richebourg - except that this site is extraordinarily rocky by any standards whatsoever. After three years of rigorous de-budding, notes Gros, her younger vines seem now to have begun regulating themselves and producing a smaller, balanced crop. Incidentally, the inaugural 2008 collection here gained in charm and complexity during the nearly 12 month interval between the two occasions when I tasted it. Whereas the 2009s - harvested on average two weeks later than the 2008s and bottled last November - kicked into malo directly out of their primary fermentations, malo-lactic transformation of the 2010s was - in typically Burgundian fashion - delayed until spring, so my notes on wines of that vintage encompass the occasional lot with residual malic acid or significant residual CO2. I did however deem my note on one wine representative enough to be worth publishing as a foretaste of what is to come.

92,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois les Fontanilles,"The Gros-Tollot 2008 Minervois Les Fontanilles projects deep blackberry, blueberry, and mulberry fruit; roasted red meat; pungent herbs; and saliva inducing salinity. A deep suggestion of veal and beef marrow puts me in mind of certain of the best cru Beaujolais, while allusions to shrimp shell reduction further enhance the mouthwatering sense of umami this cuvee projects. Firm, tightly-stitched tannins allied to exuberant, infectious juiciness suggest a wine capable of performing well for the better part of a decade, and an opportunity to play around a bit at table with a bottle of this beauty revealed its versatility. Gros particularly likes the influence of the Cinsault in flavor, texture, and moderation of alcohol and says if she does some more planting on sandstone it will be of this variety. ""The Grenache is a mistake,"" she says, laughing, in referring to its tendency to ripen at around 15% alcohol. But in fact, the finished Gros-Tollot blends nearly always weight in at only 13.5-14%.

93,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois la Ciaude,"Gros and Tollot's 2008 Minervois La Ciaude projects impressive depth of fruit; interactive, high-toned complexity of floral, mineral, and savory carnal nuances; along with sheer energy doubtless - as Gros suggests - testifying to the efficacy of both 104-year-old Carignan vines as well as to high active lime and water retention in these soil. If the corresponding Fontanilles evoked meat marrow and shrimp shell reduction, this Ciaude suggests lobster shell reduction in its sense of sweet, subtly saline, and hauntingly mineral savor. I suspect that it will be worth following for a decade of not longer, but in lieu of any track record that can only be taken as an intuitive guess.

94,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Minervois 50 / 50,"The combination of textural refinement; palpable extract yet levity; sheer juicy exuberance; and persistent, dynamic interplay of stone, salt, bittersweet nut oils, and dark berry fruit render Gros and Tollot's 2008 La 50/50 a fine value apt to prove highly versatile over the next several years.

95,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Clos Vougeot le Grand Maupertui,"Tart but ripe black raspberry (as in the corresponding 2006) is joined by its spirituous framboise counterpart as well as grenadine; overlain by smoky peat and Latakia tobacco smokiness; and suffused with alkaline minerality and bloody meatiness as well as roasting pan-drippings in Gros’s 2008 Clos Vougeot Le Grand Maupertui. Refined tannins permit an unusual degree of textural caress and finesse to emerge for such a young Clos Vougeot, and this finishes with saliva-inducing carnal savor, intriguing mineral nuance, and admirable purity of fruit. I suspect it will keep well for at least close to a decade, but I see no reason to deprive oneself of the pleasure of early (or, for those with the requisite disposable income, frequent!) acquaintance. 

Anne Gros always tends to prefer a light touch with extraction. This applies to a set of 2008s that she bottled already in December and agrees will probably be best enjoyed on the early side (though I suspect she might find my suggestions a tad too conservative). She picked until quite late, though, and – relative to most of her colleagues – even later in 2007, from which unfortunately I did not get opportunity to taste her collection. “The past three vintages,” she notes – including 2009 in her comment – “I’ve taken three weeks to harvest six and a half hectares, and I now regret that in the previous years I started too late,” meaning it was impossible to take as much time as she prefers for her wide range of elevations and exposures with grapes both black and white. (In 2003, harvest took place the 25th through 28th of August, the earliest and fastest harvest in the history of the domaine, but one Gros says she hopes fervently never to have to relive.) In Clos Vougeot alone, Gros harvested for five full days in 2008.

96,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Echézeaux Les Loächausses Grand Cru,"The 2008 Echezeaux Les Loachausses represents Anne Gros’s second vintage from family vines leased for a quarter-century (since before the birth of Domaine Anne Gros) to Domaine Gros Frere et Soeur. (Actually, she has had a few rows of Echezeaux all along, but not enough to fill a standard barrique, let alone commercialize.) This evokes perfume and pungency of hibiscus, cooked ginger, and smoky Latakia tobacco. Persistent inner-mouth florality and smokiness are accompanied on a palate of delicacy and textural refinement by tart, vintage-typical fresh red berry fruit subtly tinged with barrel-reinforced vanilla cream and caramel that contribute lovely finishing counterpoint. This veritable alter-ego of Gros’s Clos Vougeot should be fascinating to follow, but watchfully, for at least half a dozen years.

97,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vosne-Romanée Les Barreaux,"Musky narcissus and gentian perfume; peat, crushed stone, and (oak-reinforced) resin; along with ripe black raspberry inform the nose and palate of Anne Gros’s 2008 Vosne Romanee Les Barreaux, whose sensed of delicacy allied to inner-mouth florality and mildly austere stoniness reflect its high-elevation, hardscrabble location above the famed Cros Parantoux. An invigorating and refreshingly juicy persistence of tart berry fruit keeps the finish here from turning spare. But the balance of elements – like the wine itself – is so delicately that I wonder whether it won’t also prove fragile, or that if it is replaced whether what replaces it will have equal charm. I’d enjoy some of this soon and then guard any bottles watchfully, as I could imagine the charm fading already in five or six years.

This finishes with mouth-watering enticement to take the next sip, as well as with recognition of the wine’s fine but persistent tannins that were previously almost undetectable. I would plan on enjoying it over the next 3-5 years.

101,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Clos Vougeot le Grand Maupertui,"Tart but ripe black raspberry and cassis are allied to tobacco and singed meat in the Gros 2006 Clos Vougeot Le Grand Maupertui, which offers a flattering creamy richness yet an invigorating sense of vivacity. The bitter side of its black fruits, its meatiness, and stony notes gain prominence in the wine's long, formidably intense, and positively frisky finish. Such a youthfully charming and enticing Clos Vougeot you won't often encounter, although I am confident it will be worth following for at least a decade.  

Anne Gros's 2006s were bottled after only 15 months to preserve the fruit and charm of a vintage she envisages for near-term enjoyment. This is a vintage whose strong suits are characteristics she regularly says she prizes above all – elegance, charm, lift – perhaps one reason why she has been particularly successful.

102,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vosne-Romanée Les Barreaux,"From above Cros Parantoux, the Gros 2006 Vosne Romanee Les Barreaux displays bright, tart cherry and raspberry, which mingle on the palate with chalk, salt, and fresh ginger. Hints of vanilla and caramel as well as fresh meat reveal themselves as this opens to the air, but it retains brightness, snap, invigoration and energetic interplay in its long finish. Gros says she backed off on new wood only slightly this year vis-a-vis 2005, but in this instance what one notices of oak is more harmoniously integrated than in the 2005 at the same stage. This should be worth following for at least 6-8 years.

103,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau,"The Gros 2006 Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d’Orveau – from high above the Clos Vougeot, but in a fog-trapping and therefore rot-prone dimple that in this instance necessitated relatively early harvest – displays brightness and purity of red fruits typical for this bottling, as well as chalky and saline mineral notes. The texture is silken and the wine's modest endowment of tannins well woven-in. The virtues of the vintage seem perfectly suited to the virtues of this site, and one ends up with a wine impeccably pure, uplifting and invigorating if not especially complex, and best suited to enjoying over the next 4-5 years.

104,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"Like its Hautes-Cotes counterpart, the Gros 2006 Bourgogne was picked late and manifestly ripe in flavor (though at only 12.7% natural alcohol). Sweet cherry and raspberry fruit inform a silken palate, and the balance of tartness and refreshment with the continued perception of textural richness is lovely. This is about simplicity and purity of Pinot fruit, and if it were not for the wine's alliance of lift and delicacy with intense ripeness I might not have been sure, tasted blind, that it was a Burgundy. I would plan to enjoy this within three years.

105,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Hautes Côtes de Nuits,"Gros's 2006 Bourgogne Hautes-Cotes de Nuits is more forward and enjoyable in its first year of bottle than its 2005 counterpart was at a similar stage. Flattering, ripe black raspberry is underlain by subtle suggestions of chalk and wet stone on a palate of considerable polish, and this finishes with juicy exuberance. It was harvested very late – and tastes that way – yet at moderate (natural) alcohol of 13.2%, albeit high for the Hautes-Cotes. I would plan to enjoy this by 2011.   Gros says she did no pigeage here – and for that matter, very little on her other 2006s, an approach that seems to be becoming standard operating procedure here.

106,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Clos Vougeot le Grand Maupertui,"The Anne Gros 2005 Clos Vougeot Le Grand Maupertui offers aromas of plum, blackberry, vanilla, wood smoke, black tea, and tincture of iodine. Charred meat flavors join the purple and black fruits on the palate, and here, too, a toasted, resinous, slightly detached note of new wood is evident. The wine finishes with genuine grand cru length, and has density, girth, and underlying structure that suggest waiting the better part of a decade – which may also bring better integration of the oak – before pulling a cork.

107,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau,"Anne Gros’s generally light touch with extraction would seem to fit the nature of a thick-skinned vintage like 2005, and there is no question she has captured an element of delicacy in her 2005 Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d’Orveau (from high above Clos Vougeot) that is rare for the vintage. Red cherry, rhubarb, cinnamon and lily-like florality in the nose lead to a polished, silky, bright, juicy, pure-fruited palate with persistent inner-mouth florality and hints of truffle. Meat and minerals enter on the long finish, which offers bloody, chalky and saline hints mingled with ripe but slightly tart red fruits. While this will have most appeal for tasters who like a little kick of acidity in their Pinot, the tannins are scarcely noticeable and the wine perfect for early drinking, indeed the most immediately charming wine in this year’s collection and my favorite Anne Gros Chambolle yet.

108,Domaine Anne-Francoise Gros,Vosne-Romanée Les Barreaux,"From the highest reaches of Vosne Romanee (above Cros Parantoux) comes the Gros 2005 Vosne Romanee Les Barreaux. Bright raspberry and red currant fruit, allspice, ginger, star anise, and a whiff of wood smoke lead to a deeply-fruited palate with bright acids and obviously firm structure, lightly marked by a note of toasty oak. The finish really grips with strong fruit, spices and salty minerality, but there is not the striking refinement of the Chambolle and a certain woodiness persists. Because of the unusually high acid profile of fruit from this site, the wine often needs a while to settle down (possibly the more so for having been lightly filtered this year) and perhaps the oak notes will be integrated.

Its scents of blackberries, black cherries, plums, licorice, and tar lead to an intense character. Its powerful, deep core is crammed with sappy dark berries as well as monstrous levels of ripe yet solid tannin. Projected maturity: 2010-2020.

Pinot Noir, a fragile varietal, reacts poorly to fining, filtration, and careless bottling techniques, I recommend caution when considering buying a red burgundy based on cask samples. I called it as I tasted it, and hope the bottled wine reflects the quality of the samples I was provided.

Anne Gros has bought out her father Francois' interest in this estate and is making super-extracted, black, deeply layered, intense wines. Lightly filtered but not fined, she uses between 80-90% new oak on her two grand crus. I consider it impossible to produce an inkier wine from Pinot Noir than she did in 1995. Readers who search out Pinot Noir with refined notes of strawberries, raspberries and tangy cherries should be aware that these wines are the antithesis.

Very dark-colored, the Vosne-Romanee Les Barreaux displays penetrating aromas of super-ripe black fruits and berries and a flavor profile packed with chewy, hyper-concentrated, floral blackberries and cassis.

138,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The 2021 Masseto is back to being 100% Merlot. Recent past vintages saw a tiny part of Cabernet Franc. That second varietal in the blend represents the proverbial ""tax"" one must pay in the face of climate change, especially when making wine on the sun-drenched Tuscan Coast. This is a very rich and elaborate expression with the extract, tannic tightness and the hefty 15.5% alcohol content to match. It comes off as quite big-boned or monotone. The wine is redolent of blackberry confit and cooked cherry, with a wide range of sweet oak spices to close. There is dark chocolate with a thin lining of creamy mint filling. Within the context of that fullness and generous fruit weight, Masseto is quite a commitment in terms of price and further cellaring. More bottle aging is an absolute requirement.",,RP 95
139,Domaine Ponsot,Massetino,"The Masseto 2021 Massetino is mostly Merlot with a touch of Cabernet Franc for good measure. The wine (packaged in a heavy glass bottle) is very richly concentrated and layered. You see (and taste) the opulent texture of the wine as it slowly coats the glass. Quality fruit is matched by carefully selected oak, and the intensity of both builds on the palate. This vintage is poised for especially long cellar aging. This vintage of Massetino (2021) scores neck-in-neck with the current vintage (2020) of Masseto.",,RP 95
140,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The 2020 Masseto now sees new DNA with a touch of Cabernet Franc added to this celebrated Merlot-based icon wine. This is a vintage of enormous richness and density, and everything about the wine is taken up a notch or two (including the bottle glass weight and the 15% alcohol content). But Axel Heinz and his team are well prepared for the hot vintages like 2020, and changes to farming and canopy management ensure even ripening. This wine is always hard to analyze in its youth. It needs many more years to soften and flesh out. Give it time.",,RP 95
141,Domaine Ponsot,Massetino,"The Masseto 2020 Massetino (Merlot with a touch of Cabernet Franc) is extremely generous and rich. This wine puts it all out there in full view with a bouquet that is stitched together with ripe blackberry and black cherry preserves, black stone or pencil shaving, sweet spice, cigar, smoke and tar. This was a warm and sunny vintage, and you feel the power of those sunbeams locked within the dark, opulent and concentrated fruit on display here. This is a special treat, and the 2020 edition offers a clear identity for Massetino. This vintage comes close to out-powering the bouquet of the 2019 Masseto also hitting the market now.",,RP 95
142,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"This bottle opens a new chapter for one of Italy's most celebrated and collected wines. The first vintage made entirely in its dedicated state-of-the-art winery (and the first vintage with a 10% dabble of Cabernet Franc added to what has historically aways been a pure expression of Merlot), the Masseto 2019 Masseto has two main themes at heart: concentration and elegance. And managing those two seemingly contrasting elements requires a little bit of magic. That's the Masseto magic we look for. The 2019 vintage delivers it in spades with lovely concentrated fruit, blackberry, integrated spice, tobacco, crushed slate, pencil shaving and lots of texture and fiber to push a lasting mouthfeel. The wine's richness translates into density and power to the palate, meanwhile the bouquet reveals fluidity and new sides as the wine opens in the glass. The finish is tapered and focused.",,RP 95
143,Domaine Ponsot,Massetino,"Tasted before bottling, the 2019 Massetino is shaping up beautifully. This is the third vintage made of the Merlot-based wine enhanced with a small part of Cabernet Franc. The Cabernet Franc is what distinguishes this euphemistically diminutive expression of Masseto, and it is its distinctive vinous signature. The 2019 vintage is soft and pliant but also incredibly rich and layered. It offers generous black fruit with ripe cherry and blackberry. Spice, tobacco and campfire ash fill in the rear and build the aromatic profile of this wine that is already stacked tall and proud. We still need to see how the 2019 plays out in the bottle, and I am especially interested to gauge how the thick and rich fruit concentration works against the less pronounced acidity of the vintage.",,RP 95
144,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The 2018 Masseto is the vintage surprise few of us could have expected. The season saw rains just before harvest, and vintners were forced into dramatic last-minute decisions and risks. The expert team at Masseto navigated those challenges with deft precision in this first vintage executed in the new winery that is now fully dedicated and engineered to fulfill the expectations of this iconic Merlot from coastal Tuscany. The new gravity-flow building has angular concrete fermentors and an old-fashioned basket press. Dark fruit and ripe blackberry bleed slowly into spice, leather, chocolate and sweet tobacco. The wine shows generous extraction and concentration; however, it remains light and lifted throughout. Welcome Masseto into your new home.",,RP 95
145,Domaine Ponsot,Massetino,"Here's our new little super star from the Tuscan Coast. The 2018 Massetino is Merlot with a dash of Cabernet Franc that makes all the difference in terms of the wine's aromatic precision and its overall staying power. Dark fruit and dried blackberry are followed by exotic spice and campfire ash. The aromas are fluid and relaxed, flowing seamlessly in unison and grace. If you love Masseto, you can't miss the Massetino. This wine offers a whole new take on the world-famous Merlot, and if we are to be honest, it paints a path to where future vintages of Masseto are going as an expression of a vineyard and territory rather than just a strict read of one grape.",,RP 95
146,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The Masseto 2017 Masseto puts on another exhilarating, knock-out performance for the third year in a row. The Masseto vineyard is a triangular-shaped plot tucked in at the back of the same property that houses the Ornellaia vineyards and winery. This special site is located at the base of the mountains that rise gently from the Tyrrhenian Sea, with the picturesque silhouette of the Castiglioncello castle at the top. The vines are planted at an altitude of 80 to 100 meters above sea level in blue clay soils that are unique to Bolgheri. That ideal position opens the vineyards to soft breezes, proximity to the sea, long daylight hours and cool diurnal shifts from the protective wall of low mountains at the back. It's a little garden of Merlot Eden. The center of the vineyard now is home to the new Masseto winery and an adjacent tasting room built into a pre-existing farmhouse. This wine was made in the old winery (the existing Ornellaia winery). Fermentation kicks off in a combination of steel and oak tanks before the wine is racked over to barrique, where it rests for two years. The wine then goes into bottle for 12 months before its release. Like most vintages of Masseto tasted this early in the game, the oak is omnipresent, and it grounds the wine in terms of texture and structure. It is powerful, but that's always the case with Masseto (this vintage records a 15.5% alcohol content). I tasted this wine next to the decidedly more playful Massetino, and the Masseto moves over the palate with substantial fruit weight and concentration gained over the course of this hot and dry growing season (which produced smaller, richer and more compact berries). Perhaps, what this vintage lacks is that profound varietal character that we saw in recent vintages like 2016 and 2015. If concerned that the hot vintage would draw out too many ripe fruit tones, the oak serves to soften some of the more volatile components of the fruit. Those distinctive notes of macchia mediterranea (wild bush) that I always associate with Masseto are less present in this vintage. You feel the oak tannins on the finish with toast and vanilla that will certainly shed as the wine ages. In fact, I went back to taste the wine 12 hours later, and they had already softened considerably. This 2017 vintage will be released in October 2020.",,RP 95
147,Domaine Ponsot,Massetino,"Now that Masseto has a new home, a dedicated winery slash temple, it makes perfect sense that the brand would introduce a sibling wine. We had been hearing stirrings regarding the possible release of a second Masseto wine, and indeed the Masseto 2017 Massetino was born at about the same time the stunning new winery was unveiled. All these exciting changes lined up perfectly, making 2019 an important milestone year for the brand. I know that some critics have commented that Masseto didn't need a Massetino, the implication being that a second wine could distract from the main attraction and give the entire operation a more commercial air. I would disagree. Not only does this addition make a perfect companion, Massetino holds its own. Masseto is famously 100% Merlot, and Massetino is 92% Merlot and 8% Cabernet Franc, a grape that has been showing spectacular results on this stretch of the Tuscan Coast. The addition of the Cabernet Franc gives this wine a very different personality, and it beautifully draws out the wine's high tones or the more lifted aromas of black olive spice and crushed aspirin or mineral that immediately catch your attention at the back of the usual black cherry, spice and tobacco. This wine is more playful and ultimately more fruit-driven, with less fruit weight. The Merlot comes from the same blue clay soils that distinguish Masseto, and the wine sees a less intensive oak regimen. You sense this in the freshness of the aromas, the elegant weightless quality of the mouthfeel and the softer tannins. Both steel and oak fermenters are used for brief skin maceration before going into barrique for 15 months, followed by an additional nine months in bottle. In all honesty, I would gladly go with Massetino over Masseto if I devilishly intended to drink the whole bottle. While Masseto can sometimes be too much, Massetino is just right. Welcome to a beautiful new world, young Mr. Massetino.",,RP 95
148,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"Masseto has pulled off back-to-back home runs. This is the first time that an Italian wine has earned 100 points in successive vintages. The 2016 Masseto is a thunderstorm of emotions, but it manages to keep them under perfect control. Like the 2015 Masseto before it, this vintage is a seamless wine of the highest pedigree. It represents an encore performance, continuing the string of successes that is bringing Italy to the forefront of the wine world. The first thing you'll notice is the thickness and concentration of the fruit that makes an immediate impact on all the senses, in terms of appearance, aroma and mouthfeel. There is no overstating the sheer power and richness of this iconic vintage of Italy's groundbreaking Merlot. Despite that considerable mass, this Masseto remains delicate and graceful. You gain better perspective as the wine opens in the glass and reveals deeper layers that were not immediately apparent on first nose: dark fruit, spice, sweet tobacco and black cherry. There is great tightness and laser focus to the fruit. I tasted the 2016 and 2015 vintages together for comparison when I scored this wine, and then I tasted this 2016 edition alone about a month later to confirm my impressions. These vintages are identical twins, two perfect wines.",,RP 95
149,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The release of this wine comes at a very happy time for the Masseto brand. The stunning 2015 Masseto is hitting the market just as the final touches are being made to the new Masseto winery. I'm told that Masseto might one day see other wines made under that same roof, so we can't exclude a future enlargement of the Masseto portfolio. The Masseto vineyard now covers seven hectares (divided into three plots), and the vines range from 30 to 40 years old. The wine is absolutely teeming with sensorial spirit that is transmitted through the bounty of the bouquet and the solid tannins of the mouthfeel. Nothing about the wine goes unnoticed or unchecked. Its many working pieces fit together with precision like a well-oiled machine. The 2015 vintage is characterized by a level of sheer exuberance that also defined the 2004 and 2007 vintages. Yet, it also reveals similar power, directness and linearity that we saw in the 2010 vintage. The 2015 Masseto takes the best of all those past vintages and confines those qualities to this single, spectacular bottle.",,RP 95
150,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The 2014 Masseto has developed beautifully over the past few years of its oak and bottle evolution. This is a very distinctive edition of the iconic Italian Merlot that delivers a silky and streamlined approach. As bold and opulent as Masseto is in the warm vintages, I personally find those wines difficult to finish because the extract, concentration and intensity are so over the top. The best vintages of Masseto usually overpower any food dish you put before them. This is a subdued and downplayed expression instead. The cool summer season has shaped fresh berry notes of wild blackberry and cassis with drying mineral, tobacco, licorice and tar. There is evident sweetness here in terms of the wine's fruit flavors and its tannins, but there also is a cooling vein of acidity that makes the difference. The alcohol feels integrated and light. If you are hankering for a less massive and less muscular Masseto, this vintage is for you.",,RP 95
151,Domaine Ponsot,Masseto,"The 2013 Masseto paints a glorious picture of Tuscany. It captures an inspired moment in time and walks an impressive tightrope between power and elegance. In my preview tasting last year, I noticed the firm textural richness of the 2013 vintage and the crystalline sharpness of its aromas. Thanks to 12 additional months of bottle aging, that impression is evermore constant and concrete. The focus is there, yet the wine has also fleshed out and put on more velvety definition especially in terms of mouthfeel. It wears its pedigree with pride, but most importantly it offers the balance and integration to promise a long and healthy aging future. The 2013 vintage follows closely on the heels of the impeccable 2006 and 2010 vintages in terms of cellaring potential. This is definitely a bottle that should interest collectors.",,RP 95

161,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"Ponsot's 2018 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes was only bottled in July 2020, and its extended élevage has really refined the wine. Opening in the glass with aromas of dark berries, cherries and plums mingled with dark chocolate, preserved citrus peel, woodsmoke and spices, it's full-bodied, concentrated and powerful, with real depth and mid-palate amplitude, its rich, powdery tannins largely concealed in a generous core of fruit. This is a muscular wine somewhat reminiscent of a more gourmand version of the domaine's 2005, and it will demand patience.",,RP 94
162,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2018 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru is quite shut down now that it's in bottle, unwinding to reveal aromas of dark berries, cherries, smoked meats, spices and violets.

164,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"The 2018 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc has turned out very nicely in bottle, mingling scents of pear and white flowers with hints of beeswax, toasted almonds and petrol.

165,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"A touch of youthful reduction dissipates as the 2018 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes opens in the glass, revealing aromas of rich berry fruits, smoked meats, spices and orange rind.

167,Domaine Ponsot,Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange,"The 2018 Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange reveals aromas of pear, white flowers and fresh peach, followed by a medium-bodied, charming palate that's lively and delicately honeyed.

Full-bodied, rich and layered, it's a velvety, fleshy wine that appears to be a decade away from true maturity. As readers may remember, this cuvée derives from the part of the domaine's holdings in lieu-dit Monts Luisants that are classified in grand cru Clos de la Roche, as it was with the purchase of this parcel that William Ponsot founded his eponymous domaine.",,RP 94

173,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"Firmer and more reserved but also ampler and more enveloping, the 2018 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru is a medium to full-bodied wine evocative of raspberries, plums, rich soil tones, peonies and burning embers.

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with a concentrated core, succulent acids and a wonderful sense of energy and tension that balances its comparatively broad shoulders. It's produced from two parcels in Aloxe-Corton, one warmer and the other cooler.",,RP 94
183,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Due to be bottled in April, the 2017 Chambertin Grand Cru wafts from the glass with a brooding bouquet of cassis, sweet spices, grilled meats and rich soil tones. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and concentrated with excellent intensity, fine-grained but abundant structuring tannins and a long finish that's still quite primary. It isn't quite as expansive and multidimensional as the domaine's Chapelle-Chambertin, but it's a very fine example of this micro-cuvée.",,RP 94

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered with a fleshy core of fruit, rich structuring tannins and a quintessentially blocky profile that's built for the long haul.

Full-bodied, satiny and expansive, the wine's fine structuring tannins are entirely cloaked in succulent fruit. The finish displays good length and delineation. Of all Ponsot's grands crus, this will be the best bet for near-term consumption.",,RP 94
187,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"The 2017 Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon unfurls to reveal a classy bouquet of ripe cherries, licorice, spices and candied violets, with little hint of the savory complexity to come. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, tangy and youthfully firm, with a lovely line of acidity underpinning its concentrated core of fruit. Abel observes that efforts have been made to render this cuvée in a more elegant register, all the while retaining the distinctive profile and aging potential of these vineyards. This year's blend is composed of some 60% Les Paulands, 20% Les Perrières and 20% Clos du Roi.",,RP 94
188,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes offers up lovely aromas of red plums, rose petals and candied peel that mingle with incipient savory nuances of grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and incisive, with excellent concentration, fine-grained and chalky tannins, and above all a bright, vibrant quality that lends this Morey fabulous definition. It will need some time, as it's much more tight-knit than the Morey village.",,RP 94
189,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc is excellent, offering an appealing bouquet of hazelnut cream, green apple and citrus, followed by a medium-bodied, concentrated and tangy palate that's built around a racy line of acidity, with excellent depth and tension at the core and concluding with an intense, lingering finish.",,RP 94
190,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives,"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives bursts with aromas of sweet spices, cherries, berries and coniferous forest floor. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and succulent acids, with fine tannins and a juicy core of fruit. Of all Ponsot's wines, this is predictably the best adapted to near-term consumption.",,RP 94
191,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Ponsot's 1999 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru is superb, wafting from the glass with a vibrant bouquet of cherries, plums, cassis, rich soil, black tea, umami-like bass notes and dried roses. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and complete, with a youthful core of beautifully pure fruit, fine-grained structuring tannins, excellent energy and delineation and a long, tangy finish. This is one of those vintages where one feels Chapelle-Chambertin's proximity to the Clos de Bèze. This is just entering the beginning of its plateau.",,RP 94
192,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes is superb, bursting from the glass with aromas of juicy cherries, peonies, blood orange, licorice, raw cocoa and espresso roast. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and succulent, with a concentrated, layered mid-palate, satiny structuring tannins and vibrant underlying acidity, concluding with a long finish. Harvested on October 7 at a comparatively high yield by Ponsot's standards of 38 hectoliters per hectare, this year seems to have been perfectly adapted to Ponsot's style. Vibrant, elegant and expressive, the 2016 is quite different from the richer, more powerful 2015, but in the fullness of time, I wouldn't be surprised to see it surpassing its brawnier elder sibling.",,RP 94
193,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"The 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes continues to show very well, and as it settles down in bottle, the tangy acids that underpin its ripe, sun-kissed fruit are becoming more apparent. Aromas of red berry compote, plums, blackberries, dark chocolate and peonies introduce a full-bodied, powerful wine with considerable mid-palate amplitude, structured around fine-grained tannins that are coming to the fore now that this Clos de la Roche it tightening up in bottle—though they remain largely cloaked in the wine's lavish core of fruit. It's an excellent wine, and I see no reason to alter my score or drinking window given earlier this year.",,RP 94
194,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes reveals a pretty bouquet of red plums, blackberries, spring flowers and potpourri. On the palate, it's full-bodied, velvety and layered, with tangy acids, fine-grained but chalky tannins and a deep, concentrated core of fruit. While this has shut down, it isn't as structurally reserved as some of the top 2014s have become. It's an elegant Clos de la Roche in the making. Harvested on September 18, this was one of Ponsot's earliest harvests in recent years: the 2013 Clos de la Roche, for example, was picked on October 9.",,RP 94
195,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"This was a superb showing for the 2007 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes, a brilliant wine that bursts from the glass with a complex and maturing bouquet of red cherries, caramelized orange rind, cinnamon, potpourri and sweet soil tones. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, textural and satiny, with a concentrated, layered core, tangy acids and a stunningly long, sapid finish. This has always been a brilliant wine that transcends the vintage, but new dimensions are becoming apparent as it enters its second decade. This was the last vintage bottled under natural cork chez Ponsot.",,RP 94
196,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"Ponsot's 2001 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes is going from strength to strength, and this bottle was showing beautifully, wafting from the glass with notes of red plums, smoked duck, cherries, spices, mustard seed and potpourri.  On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with chalky but melting tannins, tangy acids and a long, stony finish. Somewhat rustic in profile, it isn't the most elegant vintage of Ponsot's Clos de la Roche, but it's beginning to drink well today.",,RP 94
197,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"More evolved than the ageless 1999, the 1998 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes is approaching full maturity, wafting from the glass with a classy bouquet of dried strawberries, cassis, sweet forest floor, potpourri and cinnamon. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and expansive on the attack, with tangy acids and seemingly melted tannins that turn chalky and assert themselves on the tense, stony finish.",,RP 94
198,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc, more than 85% of which hails from Aligoté vines planted in 1911, opens in the glass with notes of citrus zest, vanilla pod, pastry cream and hazelnuts. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and textural, with tense acids and a grippy, almost phenolic finish.",,RP 94
199,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives,"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives is very pretty this vintage, offering up lovely aromas of sweet red cherry, strawberry and peony. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, fine-grained and silky textured, with an expansive attack and notable structural amplitude. This is classic Ponsot.",,RP 94
200,Domaine Ponsot,Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange,"The 2015 Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange is very pretty, wafting from the glass with notes of honey, white flowers and orchard fruit. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a glossy attack and fresh acids, finishing with good grip. William Ponsot originated in Saint-Romain, and this bottling nods to that heritage.",,RP 94
201,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is excellent, opening in the glass with notes of golden orchard fruit, spring flowers, orange zest and hazelnut cream, gently framed by new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied with a glossy attack, superb concentration and an almost chewy sense of extract, its taut structural elements asserting themselves on the grippy finish. While this is marked by the warmth of the vintage it has the necessary energy and freshness to retain its balance.",,RP 94
202,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes is deeper and more serious than the Cuvée des Grives, wafting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of ripe plum, cherry, cinnamon, licorice, rich soil and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, sappy and powerful, with a deep core of sweet fruit that conceals an ample chassis of fine-grained, chalky tannin.",,RP 92
203,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"This was a superb showing for Ponsot's 2001 Chambertin Grand Cru, its bouquet unfolding to reveal notes of red plum, cherry, rich soil, grilled meat and a touch of herbs. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and expansive, with a beautiful line of bright acidity, enrobed tannins and lovely length and persistence. I had wondered whether Ponsot's lavish style would be at odds with the racy character of the vintage, but in fact, the wine's vibrancy only adds to the ensemble.",,RP 92
204,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"The 2015 Clos Saint-Denis Très Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru has a very elegant and stylish bouquet with red cherry, crushed strawberry and bergamot scents the unfurl in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe dark cherries, raspberry and cranberry fruit, quite pointed acidity but with good balance on the structured, lightly spiced finish. This was showing better than several other grand crus at the time of tasting from barrel.",,RP 92
205,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chambertin Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru, from vines planted in 1961, has an extravagant bouquet with small red cherries, wild strawberry and raspberry jam, nicely defined with commendable purity. The palate is medium-bodied with a ripe red cherry and strawberry drive on the entry, fine mineralité and tension with a slightly brusque but nicely detailed finish. Give this 4-5 years in bottle.",,RP 92
206,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru has the most composed bouquet of Laurent Ponsot's grand crus from the Gevrey appéllation, with seductive scents of black cherry, wild strawberry and crushed violet. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin and crisp acidity, pretty dark cherries and blueberry here with a slither of Seville orange marmalade on the finish. It is a satisfactory Griotte Chambertin, although I would like to see more depth, more energy conveyed towards the finish.",,RP 92
207,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes has a refined bouquet, very pure redcurrant and wild strawberry fruit that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is very pure on the entry with fleshy red cherry and raspberry fruit, a keen thread of acidity with a citrus-like finish. It just cuts away a little sharply on the finish, but hopefully it will flesh out by the time of bottling.",,RP 92
208,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"The 2015 Chambolle Musigny Cuvee des Cigales has a voluminous bouquet with crushed strawberry and raspberry fruit, fine definition and quite floral in style. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, fleshy in the mouth with red cherry and strawberry fruit, leading to a gentle, quite sensual finish—very Chambolle in style.",,RP 92
209,Domaine Ponsot,Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson,"The 2015 Bourgogne Cuvee Pinson has a ripe, slightly candied bouquet that has a slight Mediterranean slant. The palate is sweet on the entry with soft red berry fruit, fine acidity with a slightly short but fresh finish.",,RP 92
210,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru showed a little more cohesion than the Charmes-Chambertin, plump dark cherries and crushed strawberry fruit, bunches of violets, some woody character that is a little jarring underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly brutish tannin, masculine in the mouth and with an assertive, lightly spiced finish that like other cuvées, just needs more flesh and fruité. I will seek to re-taste this wine at a later date.",,RP 92
211,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton Bressandes Grand Cru has a very opulent bouquet of kirsch, dates and fig, just a faint touch of volatility developing in the glass. The palate is chewy on the entry with firm tannin, tightly wound red cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, though the finish feels gritty in the mouth and leaves a slightly dry aftertaste. Again, this is a Corton I would like to revisit once in bottle.",,RP 92
212,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"The 2015 Corton ""Cuvée de Bourdon"" Grand Cru did feel a little volatile on the nose when I tasted it. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet red fruit, quite firm tannin but lacking real cohesion towards the austere finish. It just feels a little static at the moment. I would like to re-taste this once in bottle.",,RP 92
213,Domaine Ponsot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles,"The 2015 Charmes-Chambertin ""Cuvée des Merles"" Grand Cru was also showing some signs of over-ripeness on the nose, smudged red cherry and strawberry fruit with touches of leather and date. The palate is medium-bodied with candied sweet cherry fruit with orange zest and tangerine, quite firm tannin with a punchy, slightly curtailed finish that needs more flesh to balance its structure. I will seek to re-taste this wine at a later date.",,RP 92
214,Domaine Ponsot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru has a rich and opulent bouquet of wild honey, acacia, lemon curd and dried pineapple, clean and pure although I would have liked more mineral expression. The palate is fresh on the entry with fine balance, texturally very satisfying with hints of hazelnut and walnut, segueing into a well-defined, slightly saline finish. A more immediate Montrachet than others, it should be ready to drink within about 3-4 years.",,RP 92
215,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru has a more approachable bouquet than the 2014 Chambertin; it is more forward and expressive with red cherries, raspberry preserve and orange blossom aromas, which gain intensity and volume with virtually each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple, ripe tannin. I adore the purity here, the sensuality of this Clos-de-Bèze that (whisper it) you might mistake for Armand Rousseau. This might well be Laurent Ponsot's finest contribution to the vintage.",,RP 92
216,Domaine Ponsot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles,"The 2014 Charmes Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles has a precise, almost pixelated, limestone-infused bouquet that blossoms in the glass with its vibrant red cherries, strawberry and bergamot scents. The palate is medium-bodied with very supple tannin. The acidity here is very well judged, smooth and silky in the mouth, extremely pure with stupendous precision on the long finish. It is the kind of Charmes-Chambertin that you instantly fall in love with. Beautiful...just beautiful.",,RP 92
217,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"The 2014 Clos St Denis Très Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru takes its time to open in the glass, but eventually offers raspberry preserve, wild strawberry and distant estuarine scents mixed with desiccated orange peel. The palate is medium-bodied and supple in the mouth. This is very well proportioned, very focused with a noticeable saline tang on the finish. It will deserve 4-5 years in bottle; it is a bit broody and introverted now, but it has the substance to blossom.",,RP 92
218,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru comprises of two barrels this year. It bears the most semblance to the 2014 Chapelle-Chambertin on the nose, those bunches of roses popping up once again, accompanied by raspberry preserve and strawberry scents, later just a suggestion of Thai fish oil. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine, supple tannin. This is clean and precise, quite spicy towards the finish that has very fine depth, though maybe it does not quite possess (or is hiding) that killer X-factor on the finish that reverts to something more conservative. A Chambertin that is serious and will demand several years in bottle.",,RP 92
219,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Griotte Chambertin Grand Cru is certainly not as immediate as that temptress, the 2014 Charmes-Chambertin. This insists upon more coaxing from the glass, more swirling to eke out those attractive scents of blackberry, raspberry preserve and rose petals, all very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with supple, ripe, sappy red berry fruit. There is pleasant tang of sour cherry here, even a hint of licorice on the finish that has more density than the Charmes-Chambertin, if not quite the nascent ""Charmes."" Give it 4-6 years in bottle and then I think you might have a serious Griotte on your hands.",,RP 92
220,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chapelle Chambertin Grand Cru behaved like the Griotte-Chambertin in that it needed a prerequisite two or three minutes to fire up its engines. When it did, it sprung a gorgeous floral bouquet with red roses, kirsch and blood orange, all struck through with wonderful mineralité and tension. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin. It resorts back to its broody nature. There is appreciable density here, quite tangy and spicy in the mouth with layers of red berry fruit on the very saline finish. It will require 4-5 years in bottle, but the class is here.",,RP 92
221,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes has a tightly-wound bouquet that does not require too much encouragement to reveal scents of macerated small red cherries, blueberry and a hint of cold flint. There is something ""cool"" about this nose (temperature speaking). The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry. I like the tannins here, precise and perhaps a little rigid, yet they frame the red berry fruit with style and lend wonderful mineralité on the finish. This is an impressive Chambolle Charmes that should age with style and grace.",,RP 92
222,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Bressandes Grand Cru has a far more generous and giving bouquet than the 2014 Cuvée de Bourdon . It offers lush red cherries and raspberry preserve aromas, dried orange peel, menthol...like a Corton Clos du Roi in some ways. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe red berry fruit and cracked black pepper, very saline in the mouth with impressive depth and structure on the finish. It starts closing up in the glass, but I think this will ultimately turn out to be an excellent, delicious and quite cerebral Corton Bressandes.",,RP 92
223,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru has a modest bouquet, bashful at first but finding its voice with aeration; it offers attractive scents of orange blossom and lime zest, almond paste and plenty of leesy notes. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity. There is decent body and depth to this Corton-Charlemagne, perhaps a touch more ""tropical"" than others, but that is counterbalanced by the mineral seam that pokes through on the long finish. Excellent.",,RP 92
224,Domaine Ponsot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru from Laurent Ponsot has a pretty bouquet with vanilla and shaved almond sprinkled quite generously over the citrus fruit. The palate is well defined with orange sorbet and citrus notes, dovetailing into comely apricot and mango infused with spice. Perhaps I was seeking more persistence and depth on the finish, yet this remains a very fine Montrachet with more to give for those with the wherewithal to age 5-8 years. ",,RP 92
225,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos Vougeot Cuvée Vieilles Vignes took a little more coaxing from the glass than its fellow Grand Crus. Quite opaque at first, the nose is deep with a mixture of red and black fruit (blacker than Laurent Ponsot's Grand Crus from Gevrey for example). The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin and grippy in the mouth, suggesting just a little more extraction perhaps? This has real weight and presence, though I would like to see more detail and tension come through on the finish. Whatever, it will need some serious aging in the cellar.",,RP 92
226,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"The 2014 Morey Saint Denis 1er Cru Allouettes has an introspective bouquet. There is something ""steely"" about this: cold metal, copper piping underneath the transparent red berry fruit. The palate is quite harmonious on the entry. There is a taut line of acidity here, clean and crisp, very linear with touches of bitter cherry towards the finish. There is something ""moody"" about this Morey-Saint-Denis, which may well be its way of saying that it needs to be cellared for 3-5 years.",,RP 92
227,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"The 2014 Corton Grand Cru Cuvée de Bourdon has quite a complex bouquet, the initial rush of redcurrant and cranberry fruit followed quickly by marine/sea spray aromas, flint and limestone very subtle but there underneath. I like the definition and the focus here. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit. There is a seam of spice here, bitter red cherry, some hardness apropos that tannin towards the finish that needs a little more flesh. That may develop by the end of its élevage. This is broody, capricious Corton, but I would like to see more charm.",,RP 92
228,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives,"The 2014 Morey St Denis Cuvée des Grives was showing just a small reduction on the nose when I tasted it, though one could still discern the tart red cherries mixed with red rose scents that gained intensity in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannin, a crisp line of acidity, a little brittle in the mouth but with a pleasant oyster-shell, marine-infused finish that is appealing. On the aftertaste, there is residue of white pepper with tang of licorice. Though it needs more harmony, it should be a fascinating 2014 once in bottle.",,RP 92
229,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny Cuvée des Cigales was showing a little earthiness, some quite pronounced undergrowth aromas in this wine (you might think it had some whole bunch fruit, but it was 100% destemmed). The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin, a little rustic perhaps, nicely balanced with a fizz of limestone on the finish, Morey-like in structure with moderate length. It just needs to muster a bit more charm by the time it is bottled.",,RP 92
230,Domaine Ponsot,Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange,"The 2014 Saint Romain Cuvée de la Mésange has a crisp lime flower and dandelion-scented bouquet, pretty and detailed. The palate is fresh on the entry with a touch of orange rind, a little tightness on the mid-palate and gently gliding to a simple, but pleasantly saline finish. Drink over the next 3-4 years.",,RP 92
231,Domaine Ponsot,Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson,"The 2014 Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson, which comes from vines located in Morey-Saint-Denis down towards the Route Nationale, has an infectious sense of energy on the nose with vivid red cherries and orange sorbet notes coming through with time. The palate is medium-bodied with light, slightly rigid tannin. I was looking for a little more depth in the middle here, as the finish feels attenuated slightly, but there is sufficient freshness to give pleasure.",,RP 92
232,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"The 2014 Morey St Denis Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc Vieilles Vignes was undergoing a very late malolactic conversion so that the nose was quite reduced when I tasted it. The palate appears to have crisp tannin and plenty of focus on the finish, but best I return to this one later, once the wine is finished.",,RP 92
233,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at Fine & Rare Wines' Clos Vougeot tasting, the 2013 Clos Vougeot Cuvée Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru from Domaine Ponsot has a rather animally nose, although it clears with time. It never quite takes full flight. The palate is very tart on the entry with red cherries and lemon zest, although it feels a little obdurate towards the finish and does not have the precision of the best Clos Vougeot in this vintage.",,RP 92
234,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Clos de la Roche Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru from Laurent Ponsot has an extravagant, generous nose with hints of kirsch and raisin infusing the cranberry and blueberry fruit. Fortunately it does seem to calm down in the glass, rein in some of that nascent enthusiasm. The palate is sweet on the entry with red fruit, marmalade and dried orange peel. This is a grand cru that just wants to go out and please, a sexy Pinot Noir that does not hold back, which is what you want from this grand cru. This is a tempting offering, so much so that it is easy to overlook its pedigree.",,RP 92
235,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Grand Cru Cuvee de Bourdon from Laurent Ponsot has a fragrant bouquet with wilted rose petals infusing the slightly rustic yet still appealing red berry fruit. The palate is a little oaky but it feel nicely integrated with the fruit. There is a gentle grip in the mouth, a healthy dash of white pepper and a sense of symmetry towards the finish that indicates a well made Corton that may warrant a higher score with continued bottle age.",,RP 92
236,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Griotte Chambertin Grand Cru from Laurent Ponsot has a voluminous nose, though there is a stalky element that is not totally combined with the black and red fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin, quite linear in the mouth, structured but like the Griotte-Chambertin 2012 from Réné Leclerc, it seems to be lacking some flesh and charm towards the finish. That said, it does develop in the glass, offering hidden notes of blueberry and a hint of crème de cassis, so I would advise not broaching a bottle for two or three years.",,RP 92
237,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"The 2013 Clos de la Roche Cuvée Vieilles Vignes, from vines planted in 1905, has an inviting, delineated bouquet with vibrant wild strawberry, raspberry preserve and mineral notes. The palate has great tension – so suave and poised with superb symmetry and an effortless finish that I don’t think the Clos Saint Denis has at the moment. Laurent Ponsot did not disguise his enthusiasm for this Grand Cru and I could understand why.",,RP 92
238,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru might very well turn out to be Laurent Ponsot's best offering this vintage. It has a very well-defined, almost crystalline bouquet with wonderful mineralité percolating through the shimmering red berry fruit. The palate possesses brilliant delineation and poise. This is not a deep or titanic Clos de Bèze, but it is interwoven with a killer line of acidity and demonstrates more complexity and finesse than the Chambertin on the finish. This is just...beautiful.",,RP 92
239,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru (planted at the same time as the Griotte incidentally) has a very pure, mineral-drive bouquet that has a touch more delineation than the Griotte at the moment. The palate is structured and very focused: real energy and tension here with a crisp, tense finish that lingers long in the mouth. This might very well turn out to be one of Laurent Ponsot’s best 2013 Grand Crus.",,RP 92
240,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The expanded title of the 2013 Chambertin Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru suggests that the vines have come of age. Conversely, it has an understated bouquet that comes across a little broody out of barrel, yet but delineated and very focused, furnished with wilted flower petals in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with supple and lithe tannins, reserved at first but fanning out with conviction on the finish. There are copious black brambly fruit here mixed with minerals and subtle tertiary notes. This should turn out to be an intriguing Grand Cru.",,RP 92
241,Domaine Ponsot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"There are three barrels of 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru since Laurent Ponsot has a second joint-venture that has expanded his production in this historic vineyard (though he did not divulge who with!) It has a touch of reduction on the nose but there seems to be good intensity underneath. The palate is very well balanced with nigh perfect acidity. Lightly honeyed with hints of brioche and walnut, it gradually builds toward a really quite effortless finish. After my cautious reaction to the 2012, this might be the better ""Monty"" from Laurent Ponsot. Excellent.",,RP 92
242,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"The 2013 Clos Saint Denis Très Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru has a lot of reduction on the nose. Once you get past that, the palate feels firm in the mouth with dense, brittle brambly black fruit cut through with a citric thread of acidity and quite a powerful finish that demonstrates good backbone - a Clos Saint Denis not to be messed around with and demanding respect. That said, I don't believe that it will turn out to be as complex as the Clos de la Roche, quite masculine but you cannot deny the symmetry in situ.",,RP 92
243,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru is much more flattering on the nose than the Cuvée de Bourdon at the moment, exuding liveliness and precision courtesy of bright red Morello cherries and wild raspberry fruit. The palate is well balanced, fresh and tense with palpable mineralité and tension, sporting great finesse on the finish. This is a sophisticated Corton-Bressandes in the making.",,RP 92
244,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru has a tightly wound bouquet with blackberry, touches of mulberry and briary. It is a relatively ""conservative"" Griotte compared to others tasted from barrel. The palate is medium-bodied with a gentle grip in the mouth. A little fuller than the Charmes-Chambertin '13 with fine backbone, this feels chewier, but with plenty of substance on the finish. This is a gutsy Griotte, but it will mellow by the time it is bottled.",,RP 92
245,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"Taken directly from tank, the 2013 Morey-Saint-Denis Clos des Mont Luisants Blanc Vieilles Vignes has a fragrant, lightly resinous bouquet that is well defined and focused. The palate is sensual, nicely balanced with just a touch of clear honey, smooth in the mouth with a rounded and surprisingly rich finish. Excellent.",,RP 92
246,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"The 2013 Morey Saint Denis 1er Cru Allouettes has a fragrant nose erring more toward red fruit such as wild strawberry and raspberry. It is well defined and pure. The palate is very well balanced with a keen line of acidity, harmonious and poised with a mineral-rich finish. This is so good that frankly, it is not that far behind Ponsot's Grand Crus in 2013.",,RP 92
247,Domaine Ponsot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles,"The 2013 Charmes-Chambertin Cuvée des Merles Grand Cru has a slight reduction on the nose that will disappear after racking. The palate is clean and fresh with small dark cherries, a touch of blueberry, good acidity and fine tension on the finish. This keeps the character of Charmes-Chambertin and offers a fine purity and elegance. It just does not possess quite the same convincing depth and breadth of Laurent's other 2013 Grand Crus at this prenatal moment.",,RP 92
248,Domaine Ponsot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Despite a touch of reduction on the 2013 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, there is tangible earthiness on the nose that renders it broodier than some other Corton-Charlemagne tasted from barrel. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity that cuts through vibrant notes of almond and Cornice pear and a dab of lemongrass upon the effervescent, precise finish. This is a sublime Corton-Charlemagne, though without quite the complexity of other vintages that I have tasted.",,RP 92
249,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes was slightly reduced on the nose, but on the palate there feels like a little more depth and extraction compared to Laurent Ponsot’s other 2013 crus with succulent ripe tannins, plenty of blackcurrant and wild strawberry fruit with a dense finish that will require some bottle age. I just like the way this stays true to what one expects from a Chambolle-Musigny, but it does not go that extra mile.",,RP 92
250,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales has a deep blackcurrant and raspberry bouquet: reserved but delineated. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, a pleasant powdery texture, a lively acidic thread and fine backbone on the finish that has a pleasant savory touch. Very fine and full of character.",,RP 92
251,Domaine Ponsot,Saint-Romain Cuvée de la Mésange,"The 2013 Saint Romain Village from Laurent Ponsot (the first time I have tasted this cru) has a lightly honeyed bouquet with touches of honeysuckle developing. It is quite rich for a Saint Romain. Viscous and honeyed, this is a rich and generous Saint Romain that caresses the palate. Delicious and hedonistic!",,RP 92
252,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"The 2013 Corton Grand Cru Cuvée de Bourdon has the most reticent nose at the moment, sultry and introspective. Likewise, the palate is obstinate and broody, quite “rigid” in the mouth with a dense, tightly wound, chalky finish. This is just lacking a little charm at the moment, but hopefully it will flesh out by the time of bottling.",,RP (87-89)
253,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis Cuvée des Grives,"The 2013 Morey Saint Denis Cuvée des Grives has a crisp iodine and raspberry preserve-scented nose, slightly reduced but that will blow off. The palate is medium-bodied with a gentle grip, a fresh line of acidity and a pastille-like finish laden with tense bilberry and blackcurrant notes. Perhaps a tad rustic compared to Ponsot's other 2013s, I would drink this over the next six or seven years.",,RP (87-89)
254,Domaine Ponsot,Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson has a crisp red cherry and raspberry bouquet: simple but bright and ""buoyant"". There is a touch of reduction on the palate, a little chewy, perhaps a touch rustic, but full of character. Not bad at all - drink and enjoy once bottled.",,RP (87-89)
255,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Laurent Ponsot’s Clos de la Roche Vieilles Vignes '11 is reticent at first and demands coaxing, although it repays the patient imbiber with lively floral scents that are entwined with strawberry pastilles and cranberry. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy and almost corpulent entry, at least for a 2011 Côte de Nuits. There is admirable depth here with fleshy strawberry and red cherry notes infused with fennel and sage. It lingers for a very long time, which is quite unusual for this vintage. While it needs another few years to completely coalesce, it will be worth the wait.",,RP (87-89)
256,Domaine Ponsot,Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bourdon,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Laurent Ponsot’s Corton Grand Cru Cuvée du Bordon ’11 offers impressive intensity on the nose: plenty of wood here, although there is at least a satisfactory level of fruit to back it up. The palate is medium-bodied with a zesty, lively entry. It does not have the sophistication or complexity of top Corton, although it is balanced, clean and fresh on the finish. It needs a little more sophistication.",,RP (87-89)
257,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Griotte-Chambertin 2011 has a concentrated, fruit-driven bouquet with blackcurrants, sloe, boysenberry jam and just a lick of nail varnish. The palate is medium-bodied with a bitter entry; rather green underneath that carapace of sweet candied red fruit and the finish is bereft of harmony and focus. This is a strange showing for a grand cru of this stature and I will seek to re-taste it because others warmed to it more than I did.",,RP (87-89)
258,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"Cropped at 10 hectoliters per hectare, the 2012 Clos-Saint-Denis Tres Vieilles Vignes, from vines planted in 1905, has a very intense, broody bouquet with intense blackberry and mineral scents that will need a few years to really unfold. The palate is medium-bodied, but like the nose; broody, powerful and intellectual with robust, saturated tannins and a gentle build to a convincing, persistency finish with a long mineral tail. Superb. 

Laurent Ponsot, when he is not the Lone Ranger fighting alleged fraud, is busy making wine in his own individual way from his winery perched on the higher reaches overlooking Morey village. As ever, he is refreshingly candid in his views, passionate about the tenets he applies to winemaking, but always counterbalanced with tongue-in-cheek humor. I concentrated on the premier and grand cru 2012s since he was just about to bottle his village crus after one year and they were not ready. He told me that he commenced picking on 3 October, several days later than most winemakers, a date that he assured me he knew as far back as June due to natural indicators, whatever they may be. Yields averaged around 19 hectoliters per hectare, lower for the grand crus, while his famous Aligote from Monts Luisants was wiped out by oidium not from the vines, but from the nearby forest that pricked the flavor of the wine. (I did mischievously quip that I knew of someone in the United States who might be able to rustle some up if so desired – I could not help myself). What I like about Laurent’s wines is that they are edgy, uncompromising, occasionally “Marmite” wines that perhaps like the man himself, goes out to divide opinion and create debate. His strict use of old barrels combined with a dizzying array of grand crus combine to create distinct wines that tend to wear their heart of their sleeves.

259,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"From barrel, the 2012 Clos de Vougeot Cuvee Vieilles Vignes has one of my favourite bouquets with wonderful vibrancy, mineralite and tension. The palate has a beguiling sense of symmetry and tension, blessed with precocious, beautifully aligned mineral-rich black and red fruit towards the finish. One of the best Clos de Vougeot this year.

260,Domaine Ponsot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chambertin Vieilles Vignes (vines planted in 1961) has a vivacious bouquet, quite floral at the moment with wonderful definition and vigour. The palate is bursting full of red cherries, redcurrant jam and a lovely aniseed note lining the finish that fans out with style. There is a lot of energy in this barrel sample, with superb definition and focus. This is a riveting, convincing Chambertin that may garner a couple more points with bottle age.

261,Domaine Ponsot,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru is tighter and more laconic on the nose compared to the Griotte, which is usual. With a little encouragement there is just a suggestion of brine, something from the deep dark sea. The palate is fresh and vibrant right from the start with fine tannins, very smooth in the mouth with impressive density and weight. This is a vin de garde for sure, with a lovely touch of white pepper lingering on the aftertaste.

It has an elegant bouquet with lovely, ripe raspberry and cassis scents, hints of violet emerging with time with wonderful definition. The palate is very candied and generous with sensual cassis and boysenberry notes, very fine balance and a long velvety finish. Delicious!

The palate is underpinned by fine, tensile tannins and there is a wonderful silver thread of acidity. Quite compact towards the finish, this Griotte has good substance and length, probably deserving of 5-6 year in bottle before broaching. Very fine.

264,Domaine Ponsot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"“I wanted another grand cru to make up a case,” quipped Laurent Ponsot as he dipped his pipette into the single barrel of 2012 Montrachet Grand Cru that he has made since 2010. It has a generous bouquet with citrus fruits, frangipane and lime flower that opens nicely with aeration but to be truthful, do not quite convince that it is from the most illustrious white vineyard on the planet. The palate is rounded and generous in the mouth with plenty of pear skin, peach and spicy notes, although like the Corton-Charlemagne, it needs just a little more tension towards the finish. This is a fine Montrachet that does not capture the heart in the same manner as some of Laurent Ponsot’s other 2012s.

The palate is solid and dense with firm, quite grippy tannins. There is plenty of energy and tension here with touches of spice and soy lining the ebullient finish. Excellent.

The palate is silky smooth with fresh black fruit: blackberry and bilberry at the tip of the tongue, more dark plum towards the back. There is a touch of reduction just occluding the finish but that will of course clear by bottling. Good matiere here – I would give this 4-5 years in bottle. Last year, Laurent bought a single barrel from the Hospices auction that he said was like chewing a piece of wood when he received it. (He’s actually not the only one with that sentiment.)

It is a huge, towering Burgundy that impresses for its gorgeous inner perfume and juicy, exuberant fruit. This shows tons of richness without being heavy or overripe in any way. Anticipated maturity: 2029-2049.  

This set of 2009s from Laurent Ponsot was among the finest I tasted. The wines are simply dazzling from top to bottom. Ponsot was among the last to harvest in 2009, essentially starting when most, if not all, of his colleagues already had the fruit in their cellars. The fruit was 100% destemmed and the wines were vinified in oak vats. The wines were then racked into barrel for the malos, where many of them stayed with no further rackings. There is no new oak at Ponsot. The barrels range from 5 to 50 years of age. The range now includes a head spinning eleven Grand Crus, which now total an astonishing 70% of the estate’s total production. Ordinarily I would suggest cellaring the top 2009s for a minimum of 15 years or so, but now that Ponsot is bottling all of his wines with synthetic plastic corks made in Italy it is hard to know exactly how the wines will develop. I tasted all of the 2009s from barrel, where they had been aging since finishing their malolactic fermentations.

The wine flows through effortlessly to the long, impeccably textured finish. Yields were a minuscule 12 hectoliters per hectare here.

The fruit was 100% destemmed and the wines were vinified in oak vats. The wines were then racked into barrel for the malos, where many of them stayed with no further rackings.

Thick and incipiently silken in texture, this beauty doesn’t stint on ripe black fruits either, as becomes especially evident in an intense, multifaceted finish that superbly harnesses the inherent energy of its vintage while remaining engaging, elegant, as well as compulsively enticing of the next sip. Look for great things over the next two decades.  

I asked Laurent Ponsot what he though were the critical factors in avoiding the prevalent pink, under-ripe grapes scattered within the clusters of 2008 vintage Pinot Noir, whose undesirable flavors were bound to have concentrated under the influence of late September wind right along with those of the properly ripe berries. “First of all,” he replied, “you had to prune correctly, which is the beginning of everything – like being in front of a piece of wood or stone as a sculptor and beginning to carve a statue. It’s artistic – not simply something that will determine how many grapes (you end up with). After that, you focus on working with and not in opposition to nature’s cycle. Why are we always the last in Burgundy to pick their grapes? It’s because we pick on time.” In the case of 2008, that meant commencing on the eighth of October; and Ponsot’s 2007s – which taste as though they must come from a completely unfamiliar not to mention remarkably great vintage – were not picked until after the middle of September. “I wasn’t sure in early tastings,” says Ponsot about his 2008s, “that all of the elements would fit together into something harmonious.” For the most part, though, they have – at least, based on my tastings from a range of barrels in late winter. With regard to the distinctively delicious and atypical personality I discovered in Ponsot’s 2007s, readers should bear in mind that he employs some of the lowest levels of sulfur in Burgundy, so there’s no pepping-up going on here by means of dosage, which is seldom employed at all! I couldn’t help thinking as I tasted them: was this much excitement really implicit in 2007 generally and somehow the opportunity to capture it was missed at more than 90% of the addresses where I taste?  Incidentally, the big news at Domaine Ponsot last year – although, Laurent Ponsot’s choice of synthetic closures for future bottlings and his remorseless pursuit of forgers and security justifiably made headlines – was that there will be Corton, Corton-Bressandes, and Corton-Charlemagne here beginning with vintage 2009.

Rich purple plum and blackberry pour out over a creamy palate while inner-mouth profusion of violet and lily – along with underlying salt and stone – serve for allure, intrigue, and saliva-inducement. This is a distinctly decadent as well as mysteriously and complexly-nuanced Pinot that finishes with haunting length and the promise of two decades, perhaps more, of fascination.

289,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"“This is one of the two barrels we still have left that was crafted from an oak tree grown in the village of Morey-St.-Denis in 1954,” says Ponsot as I taste his 2008 Clos Vougeot Cuvee Vieilles Vignes from it. Neither it nor the (at least slightly!) younger barrels here interfere with this wine’s strong flow of juicy plum and blackberry along with soy-like, saline savor. Hints of game, along with roasted red meat richness typical for its appellation well up as this opens to the air. Fine-grained tannins offer a reassuring sense of support structure and this finishes with impressive persistence. I expect it to be worth following for 15-20 years.  

I asked Laurent Ponsot what he though were the critical factors in avoiding the prevalent pink, under-ripe grapes scattered within the clusters of 2008 vintage Pinot Noir, whose undesirable flavors were bound to have concentrated under the influence of late September wind right along with those of the properly ripe berries. “First of all,” he replied, “you had to prune correctly, which is the beginning of everything – like being in front of a piece of wood or stone as a sculptor and beginning to carve a statue. It’s artistic – not simply something that will determine how many grapes (you end up with). After that, you focus on working with and not in opposition to nature’s cycle.

290,Domaine Ponsot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles,"Purple plum and dark cherry in the nose of Ponsot’s 2008 Charmes-Chambertin Cuvee des Merles are augmented by alluring perfume of peony and heliotrope. Tenderly-textured, expansive, and buoyant, its palate is perfectly suited to receive those ripe fruits and sweet perfume. Yet along with seductive richness there is a striking sense of transparency here, not only to inner-mouth floral nuances but to underlying chalk, salt, and crystalline minerality that seems to positively shimmer in the wine’s long, lip-smacking, lip-licking finish. Almost ethereally as well as shockingly bright and light, this striking Charmes ought to be worth following for at least a dozen years, though it’s unusual enough that I hesitate to prognosticate.

291,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Blueberry fruit and citrus oils inform a surprisingly creamy yet also vivacious palate on Ponsot’s 2008 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes, which displays a textural and tannic refinement; near creaminess; as well as bright length reminiscent of – yet going beyond – those exhibited by the corresponding village cuvee. Saliva-inducing salinity and suggestions of chalk add enticing and intriguing mineral dimensions, while star anise, black tea, and peat add a metaphorically dark aspect. This long-lined, energetic, exuberantly-finishing exemplar of its great site ought to be worth following for at least a dozen years.

292,Domaine Ponsot,Gevrey-Chambertin Cuvée de l'Abeille,"Bright, fresh cherry fruit is tinged with vanilla as well as lemon and tangerine oil on the pungent nose and abundantly juicy palate of Ponsot’s 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin Cuvee de l’Abeille, a cuvee cut from the same –almost white wine-like – cloth as its appellation Bourgogne sibling. There is a subtly sense of satin to the texture here and no sense of bifurcation or awkward tartness. Practically Chablis-like suggestions of meat stock and mineral savor inform a long, lip smacking finish. This should be fascinating to follow and to creatively employ at table over the next 5-7 years, though whether for longer than that I don’t feel at all able to predict given the wine’s literally off-the-charts character.

293,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"The Ponsot 2008 Chambolle-Musigny Cuvee des Cigales emphasizes piquant fruit pit and citrus oil flavors, mingled with bittersweet, bright dark berries. Thanks to sheer levity and ultra-refined tannins, this projects striking elegance and sheer refreshment of a sort almost uniquely possible in its vintage, finishing with bright, vibrant, focused persistence. Look for at least 6-8 years of stimulation, and quite possibly more.

294,Domaine Ponsot,Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson,"The Ponsot 2008 Bourgogne Cuvee Du Pinson – grown just below the route nationale in Chambolle – evinces floral (hyacinth, narcissus) perfume rare for its appellation, allied to coniferous, fir-like (not fur-like!) scents and ripe, fresh cassis and black raspberry. Vivacious but not tart, this only very subtly-tannic Pinot refreshes almost like a white wine. It should prove delightful for at least 3-4 years. It bears reiterating – lest some of this wine’s florality be wrongly-ascribed – that Ponsot entirely de-stems his fruit. Unfortunately, he estimates that only about 25 cases of this little gem make it to the U.S. annually.

This finishes with a resonance, clarity, levity (despite its alcoholic richness) and sheer persistence rare even in Burgundy’s highest echelons, to say nothing of in 2007. I predict that this will also transcend other 2007s in its aging potential and continue to offer thrills for 20-25 years.

Vibratory oscillating intensity of fruity, herbal, and sanguinary carnal elements, allied to saliva-pumping salinity and soy-like savor make for a riveting finishing experience that reels you back for the next sip, and is likely to continue doing so for another two decades. As if such a quality of performance and such a vinous personality weren’t quite astonishing enough for their vintage, I discovered that this Chambertin was carrying 14% alcohol, which I would never have guessed. “You don’t feel it,” contends Ponsot – granted, somewhat simplistically and provocatively – “because it’s made by nature and in harmony with nature.”

300,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Roasted red meats, dark cherry and purple plum tinged with black pepper, black tea, and soy characterize Ponsot’s 2007 Clos Vougeot Cuvee Vieilles Vignes, which combines rich ripeness, expansiveness, and textural polish with an invigoratingly bright fruit skin edge and saliva-inducing, saline savor. While the fine tannins here are impeccably tucked-in, it is one instance where the roughly 14% alcohol achieved in Ponsot’s crus from 2007 is felt as slight finishing heat. But that is a minor deterrent to the appreciation of a singularly fine achievement for its vintage and a testimony to the stature of the best sites in this enormous as well as famous grand cru, and one that should stand for two decades.  

I asked Laurent Ponsot what he though were the critical factors in avoiding the prevalent pink, under-ripe grapes scattered within the clusters of 2008 vintage Pinot Noir, whose undesirable flavors were bound to have concentrated under the influence of late September wind right along with those of the properly ripe berries. “First of all,” he replied, “you had to prune correctly, which is the beginning of everything – like being in front of a piece of wood or stone as a sculptor and beginning to carve a statue. It’s artistic – not simply something that will determine how many grapes (you end up with). After that, you focus on working with and not in opposition to nature’s cycle. Why are we always the last in Burgundy to pick their grapes? It’s because we pick on time.” In the case of 2008, that meant commencing on the eighth of October; and Ponsot’s 2007s – which taste as though they must come from a completely unfamiliar not to mention remarkably great vintage – were not picked until after the middle of September. “I wasn’t sure in early tastings,” says Ponsot about his 2008s, “that all of the elements would fit together into something harmonious.” For the most part, though, they have – at least, based on my tastings from a range of barrels in late winter.

Teak, wood ear mushroom, and smoky animal fat notes lend fascination to the nose and a glycerin-rich, slick, yet persistently sappy palate. There is an invigoratingly tart edge to this that you might anticipate from 2008, but certainly not 2007. Expect it to intrigue your imagination; invigorate your palate; and milk your salivary glands for at least the next 10-12 years.

302,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"Red currant, lingonberry, and rose hip scent and surprisingly brightly flavor the Ponsot 2007 Chambolle-Musigny Cuvee des Cigales, while a veritable halo of high-toned green tea, kirsch, and generally distilled red fruits in the nose, transforms itself into a swirling inner-mouth volatility that strikingly compliments the wine’s sheer juiciness. A clean, strikingly vivid, marrow-rich underlying meatiness adds depth and persists into an otherwise bright; penetrating; peat-, chalk-, salt- and fruit pit-tinged; saliva-including finish. This tres-Chambolle but very un-2007 Pinot is one of those that make you ask “how can something like this come from grapes?” And the intrigue is sure to remain for at least the better part of a decade. But to be honest, Ponsot’s 2007s are so singular – not only in the context of their vintage – that I hesitate to handicap them.

303,Domaine Ponsot,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru Cuvée des Merles,"Cherry, red currant and blond tobacco inform the nose and bright, firm palate of Ponsot’s 2007 Charmes-Chambertin Cuvee des Merles. Clean underlying meatiness adds depth here, although a faintly raspy streak of tannin persists in the otherwise exuberantly juicy and impressively persistent finish. It will be interesting to see whether this picks up greater complexity and/or polish with time, and I would be inclined to want to revisit it in a few years before rendering any prognostication for longer term aging. I tasted this – like his other 2007s and 2008s – in Ponsot’s company, and was thus able to assure myself that the bit of roughness was not bottle-specific.

304,Domaine Ponsot,Bourgogne Rouge Cuvée du Pinson,"Raw red meat and red raspberry along with hints of game and flowers on the nose of the Ponsot 2007 Bourgogne Cuvee Du Pinson continue on a palate of unusual polish for the wine’s classificatory stature. Chambolle-like as befits its origins, this finishes with both decadence and charm, soothing yet persistently stimulating. It should remain delicious for at least the next several years and represents a remarkable performance (the first of many of its collection) considering its vintage, one in which village-level wines can consider themselves lucky to attain such a level of complexity and allure. This represents as well a fine value – that is, for the few folks lucky enough to locate any of the 300 or so bottles that ship to the U.S. annually.

306,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru Cuvée Vieilles Vignes,"Sweetly ripe black fruits in the nose of the Ponsot 2006 Clos de La Roche Cuvee Vieilles Vignes prepare the way for a more succulently, generously sweet fruit, plush texture, and generally sunny disposition than that presented by the corresponding Clos St.-Denis. Ripe cherry and red currant flood the creamy, silken palate with sweetness, while some of the same notes of citrus oil, floral perfume (here iris), and peat as exhibited in the Clos St.-Denis swirl about, too. Saline, chalky suggestions help offer contrast and a sounding board to the fruit, and this finishes with exhilarating lift, riveting interplay, and phenomenal length. Here is a combination of textural allure and backbone for which velvet gloves and iron fists seem inappropriately mundane – not merely archaic – metaphors. Blind – I must confess (and did, to Ponsot) – that I would more likely have guessed this to be Musigny than Clos de la Roche. In an extreme instance of a phenomenon shared by many of the best 2006s, I find this irresistible now; find it hard to imagine its having ornery or sulking phases; yet expect it will be worth following for 20 years.

Here we have the sheer size and slightly gruff tannic grip of the corresponding Clos Vougeot combined with the nuance, intrigue, and exhilarating length of this year's Chambertin. Game, peat, forest floor, citrus oils, and high-toned kirsch and framboise practically assault the nose. Bitter-sweet tart berry fruit and myriad mineral shadings erupt on the palate, while the dark soil and animal low tones as well as the spirituous manifestations of fruit – joined by hints of floral perfume – persist all the way through to a finish of energetic lift as well as faintly gritty and tactilely spicy persistence.

Ponsot's 2006 Chapelle-Chambertin – his last-bottled wine of the vintage, and which I last tasted from its four barrels – offers smoke, leather, ripe plum, and high-toned maraschino in the nose, leading to a richly-fruited as well as richly meaty, yet bright and buoyant palate that proves transparent to mineral and animal nuances as well as prodigiously persistent.  The ample tannins here are refined and deftly woven into the wine's fabric. This should be a superb candidate for 12-15 years fascinating evolution, though one that should already deliver enormous pleasure and intrigue as soon as it recovers from bottling. Didn't somebody speak about hail in this vineyard, too?!

310,Domaine Ponsot,Griotte-Chambertin Grand Cru,"From Ponsot's site worst-hit by hail and from some of his youngest vines, a 2006 Griotte-Chambertin betrays neither of these facts in the glass. Ripe plum and black raspberry mingle with wood smoke in the nose. This is especially bright and energetic on the palate, yet glycerin helps support the rich, sappy fruit impression and cream-over any tannin for one of those 2006 finishes that manage to be at once soothing and invigorating, and that exhibits the peculiar and somehow seemingly ferrous notes that signal this site. Like most of the wines in its collection, this really blossoms and takes on nuance as it takes on air. I suspect it will be worth following for at least a decade. Ponsot says that a sort of surface-scouring whirlwind effect – ""something I have never seen before … but there is no other explanation"" – was apparently created in the shallow bowl that is Griotte, because the hail did more damage to leaves around the fruit zone than to the photosynthetically primary canopy foliage.

High-toned aromas of kirsch and framboise lead to a palate of silken refinement and uncanny buoyancy yet abundant, intense fruit mingled with peat and licorice. The empty glass wells up with suggestions of floral perfume and grass-fed raw red meat. This finishes long and refined but also refreshing in a way one seldom encounters in grand cru red Burgundy unless as a result of superficial lightness or patently high acidity, neither of which applies here.

312,Domaine Ponsot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"From a parcel of ancient vines up against the wall below Grands Echezeaux that he accesses through a share-cropping arrangement, Ponsot's 2006 Clos Vougeot Cuvee Vieilles Vignes appears to have violated his previously-stated labeling principles. ""The vines for my Chambertin and others are as old as those in Clos de la Roche,"" he has said, ""but 'Vieilles Vignes' has lost its meaning. Ok, we put this on the label of the Clos de la Roche because people expect it; it's become like a brand."" In any event, the wine smells of and saturates the palate with elderberry, cassis, rich beef stock, and quarry dust. Predictably (or at least, according to my notion of this terroir) less refined than its grand cru siblings in the present collection, this broadly stains the palate with black fruits and iodine and combines a coarser weave of tannin with pronouncedly stony minerality. Ponsot thinks this wine's virtues will transcend its slight ""roughness"" and that ""you just need to give it some time in the bottle."" I'd say 4-5 years would be a good guess, followed by the anticipation of good behavior for half a dozen more.

Red raspberry and red currant retain their brightness while informing a subtly silken, tenderly-textured and buoyant palate on which the tannins are so refined as to be scarcely noticeable. Ginger, white pepper, salt, and chalk dust add interest and invigoration to a long, saliva-drawing finish. As this warms and takes on air, intriguing suggestions of musk and other animal scents emerge. This epitome of Chambolle and of vintage 2006 elegance should be a perpetual delight over the next 8-10 years.

314,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Cuvée des Alouettes,"From Ponsot's monopole Clos des Mont Luisants (virtually surrounded by grand crus, and which, he opines, represents as steep a slope as exists in the Cote de Nuits), the 2006 Morey-St.-Denis 1er Cru Cuvee des Alouettes exhibits a healthy, deep color; a nose of well-hung game, cassis, blackberry, and dark chocolate; a creamy richness rare in this vintage; and a low-toned finish in which the wine's abundance of tannins becomes evident as a fine, subtly-abrasive though relatively well fruit-covered spread. The more this opened to the air, though, the more game-like notes dominated, so one should probably treat that as an omen for the wine's future rather than a temporary manifestation of reduction which would in any case be rare at Ponsot where the wines are not sulfured.

316,Domaine Ponsot,Chambolle-Musigny Cuvée des Cigales,"Ponsot's 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Cuvee des Cigales brims with bright red currant and cherry, accented by iris and citrus peel, while underlying notes of char and chalk provide contrast and a sounding- spring-board for the vivacity of fruit. There is a slightly split personality here – at least at this early stage – between suggestions of creaminess and a certain angularity of tannin in the wine's finish. I would plan to enjoy this over the next 3-5 years.  

Picking chez Ponsot began predictably late – on September 27 – and lasted until October 5. As might have been expected, Laurent Ponsot acted rigorously in the vineyards in the immediate aftermath of hail and eventually on the sorting table (overseen, he notes, by an especially meticulous team of three young women) to insure that any effects were minimized.

317,Domaine Ponsot,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc,"Laurent Ponsot’s five barrels of 2006 Morey-St.-Denis Mont Luisants tasted for a second time this spring after assembly for bottling represent a return to the 100% Aligote that his great grandfather had planted in 1911, an act which, Ponsot insists, followed a then long-standing tradition of planting that grape in especially chalky and/or nosebleed sectors of the Cote de Nuits.  Nectarine, apricot, fresh lime, and iris inform this wine’s effusive bouquet, and a patisserie-like overlay of yeast and vanilla offers lovely counterpoint; speaking of which, a subtly tart fruit skin and citrus zest note I associate with this unjustly maligned grape runs throughout. The interchange of mineral and bright citrus and pit fruit on display here – yet accompanied by a plush texture – is reminiscent of Riesling, and there is a depth of flavor and a richness beneath the wine’s ripe, juicy acidity that promise at least a decade’s worth of fascinating further evolution. The 2005 was even more strikingly – and somewhat more adamantly – mineral from barrel, and will surely be worth a search of the marketplace. Ponsot was not ready to show the bottled wine this Spring. Given this wine’s virtues, it is small wonder that Ponsot is bullish enough on Aligote to have planted more. But he adds that it will take at least a decade for fruit from these vines to merit consideration for white Mont Luisants.

Ponsot’s grandfather had introduced the white Gouges mutation of Pinot Noir – and later some Chardonnay – to the site and blend. The former was ripped out in 1993 and the Chardonnay was replaced with Pinot Noir in 2005.

318,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"The 2005 Clos St.-Denis Cuvee du Centenaire – from vines planted in 1905 – is remarkable for the intensity and richness of its black fruit and exotically floral nose, its creaminess and almost Esszencia-like glycerin-richness, unctuousness, and viscosity, sumptuous flavors of black fruits, game, brown spices, blond tobacco, and preserved walnut, and a finish with prominent fruit pit bitterness but exhibiting remarkable subtlety. There is a Riesling-like intricacy of fruit-mineral interplay outlasting the sheer, stubborn clinging richness of fruit. Alas, a mere 125 cases will be bottled of this amazing wine. 

Laurent Ponsot (like his father) vinifies to the beat of a different drummer, whether it is in his employment of a basket press from 1945, his reliance on exclusively (truly) old barrels, his aggressive pigeage, or his virtual refusal (since 1988) to sulfur the wines (nitrogen and CO2 are administered at bottling). The results are as distinctive as the methods, but also profoundly impressive and proven to age magnificently. Certainly one has to adjust to a background level of chocolate and that lack of a certain “pep” that is otherwise conveyed, MSG-wise, to wines given a normal quota of sulfur during their elevage. But after a few samples – and especially when I re-tasted these wines “cold” at 7:00 A.M. – I was fully attuned to their virtues. The alcohols in 2005 are as high as 15%, but you do not notice it, even when told. Asked when he intends to bottle, Ponsot replies “I don’t know.

I envision this spectacular, full-bodied and concentrated wine aging gracefully for 15+ years. This note is the result of tastings I did in Burgundy between January 7 and January 29. The wine was tasted from cask, not bottle. Pinot Noir, a fragile varietal, reacts poorly to fining, filtration, and careless bottling techniques, I recommend caution when considering buying a red burgundy based on cask samples.

With an exceptionally ripe, complex, incredibly deep flavors that are filled with red and black berries, this wine has prodigious depth, extraction as well as spectacular length. The tannin is looming behind the fruit. It requires 8-9 years of cellaring, and is capable of lasting 15-20+ years. This note is the result of tastings I did in Burgundy between January 7 and January 29. The wine was tasted from cask, not bottle. Pinot Noir, a fragile varietal, reacts poorly to fining, filtration, and careless bottling techniques, I recommend caution when considering buying a red burgundy based on cask samples. I called it as I tasted it, and hope the bottled wine reflects the quality of the samples I was provided.

346,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"The Clos St.-Denis vineyard is scheduled to be replanted in 1996 so the 1994 and 1995 will be the last Domaine Ponsot wines from Clos St.-Denis.  Only 400 bottles of the 1993 were produced and only a whopping 24 bottles will make it to the United States.  A fabulously concentrated wine with old vine intensity, an inner-core of sweetness, full body, and brilliant balance, it is loaded with fleshy, ripe, concentrated Pinot fruit.  Cellar it for 4-5 years and drink it over the subsequent 20.  While I am a great believer that low yielding, highly concentrated Pinot Noir deserves plenty of toasty new oak, there is not one new oak barrel to be found in Ponsot's cellar.  The average age of the barrels is between 30-60 years, thus proving that there is at least one exception to the rule that the greatest red Burgundies are kept in new oak casks!
Note:  Ponsot also makes and bottles wines for the Domaine des Chezeaux.
The good news is that Ponsot's 1993s are spectacular wines, as stunning as his prodigious 1990s.  The bad news is that his yields were minuscule, with the average for all his vineyards approximately 20 hectoliters per hectare, or just over one ton per acre.  For some of the grand crus, yields were so tiny that the number of cases that will make it to America is preposterously low.  For example, yields for the Clos St.-Denis vineyard were 8 hectoliters per hectare, for Clos de la Roche, 18 hectoliters per hectare, and for Griotte-Chambertin, 23 hectoliters per hectare.  Laurent Ponsot stated that only 48 bottles of Chambertin were allocated to America, 24 bottles of Clos St.-Denis (only 400 bottles were produced), and less than 30 cases of Clos de la Roche Vieilles Vignes.  It is not that the United States is getting screwed in the allocation system, but just that so little wine was produced.  My reviews are, therefore, largely of academic interest.

Ponsot's Chambertin exhibits great richness, a profound nose of smoked meats, herbs, berry fruit, and forest-like aromas.  Rich and full-bodied, with an expansive texture, this spectacular Chambertin should age effortlessly for 20+ years.  Uncharacteristic of many 1993s, its sweet fruit and ripeness are reminiscent of the 1990 vintage, with its tannin largely concealed behind the wine's massive fruit extraction.

The sad news is that only 5-10 cases of the Clos St.-Denis are likely to be imported to the United States.  The color is saturated ruby/purple, and the huge nose of cassis, smoke, minerals, and spices is mindblowing.  An unctuous texture and phenomenal richness are evident in this wine that is held together by moderate tannin and relatively low acidity.  This is a huge, massively extracted, amazingly well-defined, impeccably balanced wine for drinking over the next 15 or more years.  It is reminiscent of the great Ponsot 1980 Clos de la Roche-Vieilles Vignes, but more concentrated.  No matter how many wines I taste, or how long the days can be in damp, dingy cellars, it is hard to spit out wines such as Ponsot's Clos St.-Denis.

361,Domaine Ponsot,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 1991 Latricieres-Chambertin is an opulent, beautifully concentrated, perfumed wine with lavish quantities of sweet fruit.  It is soft and velvety-textured with wonderful mid-palates and length.  Its tremendous richness explodes at the back of the palate.  However the low acidity and sweet tannins already make this wine delicious.  It should drink well for another 10-12 years.

The perennially inconsistent Domaine Ponsot has, along with the Domaine Leroy, turned in the vintage's most extraordinary performances.  This domaine made mind-boggling 1990s, but a strong case can be built that Laurent Ponsot and his father have fashioned 1991s that are as rich and profound as their 1990s.  Certainly their yields were significantly lower.  In fact, only Domaine Leroy had yields as low as Ponsot's average of 16 hectoliters per hectare (less than 1 ton per acre).  Keep in mind that 1 ton per acre on 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare is considerably different than 1 ton per acre from new world vineyards that have 1200 vines per hectare.  In the top grand crus, such as Chambertin, Clos St.-Denis, and Clos de la Roche, Ponsot's yields were between 9-13 hectoliters per hectare - and from exceptionally old vines.

364,Domaine Ponsot,Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes,"Ponsot's terrific 1990s are his finest wines since 1980.  The 1990 Clos St.-Denis-Vieilles Vignes and the 1990 Clos de la Roche-Vieilles Vignes are the superstars of this estate.  The Clos St.-Denis-Vieilles Vignes reveals less of the animal side of Pinot Noir and more of the black fruit character.  The aromas of over-ripeness that are apparent in the Clos de la Roche are not as obvious in the Clos St.-Denis.  This wine is densely colored, with a huge perfume of black fruits, herbs, and truffles.  Full-bodied and rich, with a viscous, thick texture, and spectacular length, like the Clos de la Roche, this is a red burgundy for drinking over the next 15-20 years.

390,Sine Qua Non,Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Substance,"Disgorged earlier this year, Selosse's latest NV Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Substance saw tirage in 2015 and, as usual, derives from a solera established in 1986. Unfurling in the glass with rich and complex aromas of dried fruits, orange zest, saffron, fenugreek, buttered toast and confit peach, it's full-bodied, ample and seamless, with a deep and layered core of fruit, racy acids and a long, resonant finish. As I've contended before, Substance is the cuvée that best exemplifies Selosse's contention (to paraphrase) that an oxidative élevage can purge a wine of the organic, leaving behind only the mineral—in this case, he argues, the imprint of two Avize lieux-dits, Les Chantereines and Les Marvillannes. For admirers of Selosse's wines, that makes it one of the most compelling bottlings in the portfolio, just as his detractors are likely to rank it as his most divisive.",,RP 99

392,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Grand Cru Les Chantereines,"The NV Extra-Brut Grand Cru Les Chantereines, this time based on the 2016 vintage and as usual derived from a parcel planted in 1922, is once again a highlight in this year's range. Wafting from the glass with aromas of peach, hazelnuts, dried flowers, buttery pastry, mocha and citrus oil, it's full-bodied, layered and sapid, with huge depth at the core, a beautifully fine-boned, racy profile and a long, penetrating finish.",,RP 99
393,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Grand Cru Chemin de Chalons,"Based on the 2016 vintage and disgorged in January 2023, the latest release of Selosse's NV Extra-Brut Grand Cru Chemin de Chalons offers up a deep bouquet of ripe stone fruits, honeycomb, mint, toasted nuts and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, ample and pillowy palate that's rich but sapid, concluding with a chalky finish. As readers will remember, this bottling derives from the Cramant part of this lieu-dit that straddles Cramant and Avize; the vines, planted in the first half of the 20th century, have been a source for the domaine's massal selection.",,RP 99

(Version Originale), I clearly underrated this wine on release. Unwinding in the glass with aromas of dried fruits, citrus oil, toasted nuts, drawn butter, yellow orchard fruit, clear honey and fenugreek, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and vinous, with terrific concentration allied with excellent tension. In fact, if this disgorgement stands out, it's for its especially notable cut and precision. Concluding with a long, sapid finish, it's a bottle that doesn't survive very long after opening in our household.",,RP 99

Bursting from the glass with botrytis-inflected aromas of tangerine, crisp yellow orchard fruit, citrus blossom, clear honey and toasted nuts, it's full-bodied, satiny and pillowy, with an open, expressive profile that lends it real immediacy. Guillaume Selosse explains that to produce the Millésime, he doesn't select the ""best"" barrels from each of the lieux-dits, but rather those with a more pronounced personality. The 2010 likely won't be the most long-lived vintage of this bottling, but it will deliver enormous pleasure over the next decade.",,RP 99
399,Sine Qua Non,Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Initial,"Disgorged in May 2021, the latest rendition of Selosse's NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Initial is showing beautifully, unwinding in the glass with aromas of pear, dried fruits, confit lemon, fenugreek, fresh bread and toasted almonds. Full-bodied, vinous and complex, it's a rich, fleshy Champagne that's underpinned by bright acids and complemented by a pinpoint mousse, concluding with a long, sapid finish. As usual, this bottling derives from the lower-altitude slopes of Avize, Cramant and Oger, where the soils are richer in clay and yields are higher when compared with the vineyards that inform V. O.",,RP 99

401,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Millésime,"The 2008 Extra-Brut Millésime is soon due for release, and I'm a little afraid to fan the flames of what is sure to be insatiable demand with a laudatory review. But such reservations notwithstanding, I'm obliged to report that the wine meets and indeed surpasses the lofty expectations that Selosse's admirers will have surely have formed for it. Disgorged in January 2020, this bottle soared from the glass with scents of citrus oil, buttery pastry, candied peel, crisp orchard fruit, toasted pecans, iodine and smoke. Full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's immensely layered and intensely vinous, with a tightly wound core, racy acids and a long, pungently saline finish. ""If the 2009 is a Catholic,"" observes Selosse, ""the 2008 is a Protestant""—though a Protestant, I'm tempted to add, who is evidently not entirely immune to the pleasures of the flesh.",,RP 99
402,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Millésime,"Whereas Selosse's vintage bottling was formerly derived exclusively from Avize, the 2007 Extra-Brut Millésime is the first that draws on all the estate's holdings, with the vins clairs chosen in a blind tasting. Wafting from the glass with aromas of yellow apple, toasted almonds, nougat, shortbread, warm spices, honeycomb and white flowers, it's full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, with incisive acids, chalky structure and a tensile profile. A bottle drunk in Burgundy several weeks after my visit to the domaine was just as striking.",,RP 99
403,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Blanc de Blancs Millésime,"A brilliant wine from this torrid vintage, Selosse's 2003 Extra-Brut Blanc de Blancs Millésime is drinking beautifully today, wafting from the glass with rich aromas of warm biscuits, golden orchard fruit, mirabelle, orange oil, toasted bread, beeswax and dried citrus peel. Full-bodied, round and enveloping, it's sapid and intense, with succulent acids and a pearly mousse. This is marked as much by Selosse's approach as it is by the vintage—in itself quite an achievement in a year such as this.",,RP 99
404,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Grand Cru La Côte Faron,"I drank a bottle of the January 2018 disgorgement of Selosse's NV Extra-Brut Grand Cru La Côte Faron from my cellar, and it showed superbly—especially several hours after opening. Wafting from the glass with aromas of buttered toast, ripe pears, quince, mirabelle, honeycomb and white flowers, it's full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with an enveloping core of ripe, textural and generously patinated fruit, succulent acids and a broad, saline finish. Formerly the cuvée Contraste, this bottling is drawn from a perpetual reserve established in 1994.",,RP 99
405,Sine Qua Non,Brut Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Origine,"The predecessor to Substance, this bottle of Selosse's NV Brut Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Origine was disgorged in 1997 and based on the 1990 vintage. Wafting from the glass with rich and complex aromas of orange oil, white flowers, musky peach, apple blossom, spices and dried fruits, it's full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a textural attack, racy acids and a long, intensely saline finish. Selosse observes that some of the vins clairs were impacted by botrytis and high in glycerol and that, at this stage, he employed more sulfur dioxide in his winemaking.",,RP 99
406,Sine Qua Non,Ratafia il était une fois...,"Admirers of the domaine will be excited to learn that there's a new rendition of Selosse's singular NV Ratafia il était une fois... in the works. A homage to the wines of Jerez, it mingles aromas of macadamia nut and almond with aromas of orange oil, marmalade, dried fruits, caramelized banana and warm spices. Medium to full-bodied, layered and fleshy, with lively acids and an intensely sapid, penetrating finish, I'm inclined to say it's even better than the last version.",,RP 99
407,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Millésime,"Disgorged in January 2020, the 2009 Extra-Brut Premier Cru Millésime represents a new direction for Selosse's vintage bottling, as Guillaume Selosse wanted to produce this cuvée from all of the six villages in which the domaine's holdings are located. The resulting wine is spectacular, soaring from the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of mandarin orange, honeycomb, ripe peaches, freshly baked bread, almond paste and dried apricots. Full-bodied, deep and complete, it's elegantly muscular and multidimensional, with extraordinary mid-palate amplitude, ripe but lively acids and a long, intensely sapid finish.",,RP 99
408,Sine Qua Non,Extra-Brut Grand Cru Les Carelles,"Disgorged in February 2020, the latest rendition of Selosse's NV Extra-Brut Grand Cru Les Carelles is already showing brilliantly, unwinding in the glass with aromas of honeyed citrus fruit, dried apricot, fresh peach, orange oil, beeswax and toasted nuts.

409,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Pajarito Del Amor,"From a bottle disgorged in December 2018, Selosse's NV Brut Rosé is based on his V.O. blend, with the addition of Pinot Noir from his friend Francis Egly. Bursting with scents of dried fruits, white cherries, beeswax and spices, the wine is full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with Pinot Noir phenolics only amplifying the chalky, mineral signature that defines the V.O.—making for a remarkably vinous, gastronomic Champagne.",,RP (98-100)
410,Sine Qua Non,Syrah SUBIR,"The 2016 Syrah SUBIR (meaning to rise or go up) is a single-vineyard wine—a barrel selection from the Eleven Confessions estate vineyard in Sta. Rita Hills. ""This vineyard is by far our coolest,"" Manfred said. ""Sometimes we don’t harvest this vineyard until November. The wines from here have a lot of structure and presence. The soil is a heavy clay, so the wines can be pretty muscular.""

I asked Manfred what he considers when he is looking to make a single-vineyard expression. ""I pick out the wines that can have longer barrel aging,"" he replied. ""The wine has to be meaningfully dense and balanced. I try to make the selection early on, when the wines go into barrel, to decide which barrels they will go into. I take thicker barrels from Seguin Moreau so that the wine evolves longer and slower.""

A blend of 89.7% Syrah, 4.6% Grenache, 2.5% Petite Sirah and 3.2% Viognier, this wine was made using 44% whole cluster. It was then reared for 38 months in barrel. Eighty-two percent of the wine was aged in new, French oak, while the remainder was aged in used barrels (one to five years old). 

Very deep purple-black, it comes bounding out of the glass with precociously profound notes of baked blackberries, plum preserves, blueberry pie, tilled earth and lilacs plus tobacco leaf, wild sage, truffles and espresso nuances. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is tautly structured, strutting a firm backbone of rounded tannins and fantastic freshness supporting the muscular, tightly wrapped layers, finishing with epic length and loads of minerally fireworks. 

932 cases, 228 magnums and 30 double magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
411,Sine Qua Non,Tectumque,"Tectumque means “shelter” in Latin. This wine was initially going to be called “Inconnue” (“unknown” in French), but that name had already been trademarked. “Naming wines is becoming impossible,” mentioned Manfred. “Everything has already been taken. Even, 'No Name!'” This is a blend of 38% Roussanne, 31% Petit Manseng, 18% Chardonnay, 9% Viognier and 4% Muscat. The vineyard components are 52% Cumulus Estate, 19% Eleven Confessions Estate, 18% Bien Nacido Vineyard and 11% The Third Twin Estate. It spent around 20 months aging in 9% concrete eggs, 4% amphora, 9% used barrels and 78% new French oak puncheons. 

Just recently bottled, the 2017 Tectumque was bit closed on the nose when I first tried it, springing to life upon second tasting a month later, offering up with seducing notes of tangerine peel, tropical fruits, paraffin wax and honeycomb with a floral undercurrent—orange blossom and honeysuckle—followed by a waft of allspice. The palate is full, rich and wonderfully creamy with compelling, juxtaposing phenolic grip. (Manfred thinks this phenolic attribute comes from the tiny Petit Manseng berries with very thick skins. These berries also lend a lot of natural acidity.) Possessing a very fresh, laser-fine line of vivacity, it finishes very long and incredibly fragrant. Given the structure, intensity and nature of the flavors, I foresee this aging with all the grace of a great Chateauneuf du Pape blanc and should easily cellar for 15-20+ years. 773 cases and 324 magnum bottles were made.",,RP (98-100)
412,Sine Qua Non,Syrah Rätsel 16,"Made exclusively from estate-grown fruit, the 2016 Syrah Ratsel 16 is composed of 81% Syrah, 7% Mourvèdre, 5% Petite Sirah, 2.5% Grenache and 4.5% Viognier that was fermented with 47% whole cluster. The vineyard sources are 47% Eleven Confessions, 38% The Third Twin, 13% Cumulus and 2% Molly Aida. It was aged for around 23 months in French oak, 47% new.

Deep garnet-purple in color, this Syrah from the relatively effortless, beautifully harmonious 2016 vintage comes blasting from the glass with notions of baked plums, black cherries, blackberry compote, licorice, spice cake and mocha plus sparks of cedar chest, lilacs, menthol and pencil lead. Big, full-bodied and opulently fruited, the mouth is completely coated with firm, unabashedly super plush tannins and seamless freshness, finishing with bags of bright fruit and fantastic energy. If a wine can be electric, this is off the charts high-voltage! 1,791 cases and 600 magnums were produced.",,RP (98-100)
413,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Dirt Vernacular,"The label of the 2016 Dirt Venacular is based on a picture of a stone imbedded in another stone. The wine is composed of 78% Grenache, 11.5% Mourvèdre, 7% Touriga Nacional and 3.5% Petite Sirah, fermented using 43% whole cluster with the whole cluster mostly used on the Grenache component. The vineyard sources are 42% Eleven Confessions Estate, 25% The Third Twin Estate, 22% Cumulus Estate, 9% Bien Nacido and 2% Molly Aida Estate. It was aged for around 23 months in 38% new French oak, 53% used French oak and 9% concrete.

Medium to deep garnet-purple, this Grenache beauty sashays out of the glass with stunning kirsch, black raspberry, stewed tea, red roses, Chinese five spice and redcurrant jelly notes with nuances of wild blueberries and candied violets plus enticing cardamom, chargrill and black pepper undertones. Full-on decadent and full-bodied, the palate is also so vivacious, possessing amazing freshness and velvety/fine-grained tannins, finishing with tons of floral and red fruit layers. Pure hedonism. 1,208 cases and 600 magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
414,Sine Qua Non,Grenache E,"This is a single-vineyard Grenache-dominated, barrel-selection blend coming from the Eleven Confessions Estate vineyard in Sta. Rita Hills. It bears Elaine Krankl’s initial and a portrait Manfred made of Elaine on the label. The blend is 82% Grenache, 12% Syrah, 5% Petite Syrah and 1% Viognier, and 56% was fermented using whole clusters. It was aged for around 38 months in French oak, 28% new.  

Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2015 Grenache E slides beguilingly out of the glass with a powerfully evocative, earthy/meaty nose of wood smoke, grilled meats, fragrant soil, truffles and iron ore with a core of kirsch, blackberry pie, Black Forest cake and aniseed plus touches of wild sage, rose hip tea and Indian spices. The palate is full-bodied, surprisingly muscular and built like a brick house with an unbelievable structure of very fine, densely pixilated tannins supporting the generous, multi-faceted layers, finishing with epic length, jaw-dropping texture and tons of cerebral mineral and spice nuances. WOW! 900 cases, 228 magnums and 30 double magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
415,Sine Qua Non,Syrah M,"This is a single-vineyard Syrah-dominant blend coming from the Eleven Confessions Estate vineyard in Sta. Rita Hills. It bears Manfred Krankl’s initial and a provocative self-portrait on the label. The blend is 90.6% Syrah, 4.4% Petite Syrah, 2.6% Grenache and 2.4% Viognier. Forty-three percent was fermented using whole clusters. It was aged for around 38 months in French oak, 66% new.  

Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2015 Syrah M starts off a little closed, slowly unfurling to show layer upon layer of savory notes: peppered salami, woodsmoke, marmite and black olives, beneath a profound core of preserved plums, blueberry coulis and Chinese five spice with fragrant touches of fenugreek, Sichuan pepper, crushed rocks and mossy bark. Exquisitely textured with firm, rounded tannins, the taut, full-bodied, muscular fruit is laced with seamless freshness, finishing with fantastic persistence. This is a Syrah for the long haul! 913 cases, 228 magnums and 30 double magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
416,Sine Qua Non,Deux Grenouilles White,"The 2016 Deux Grenouilles White bursts with expressive aromas of apricot preserve, yellow plums, dried flowers, orange rind and Acacia honey. It's a deftly judged blend of 36% Roussanne, 29% Chardonnay, 23% Viognier, 9% Petite Manseng and 3% Muscat, and the exotic aromatic contributions of the Viognier and Muscat don't drown out the subtle expressions of the other varieties. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, fat and lavish, with considerable satiny texture, juicy acids and a sapid, even savory finish that I suspect reflects the Petite Manseng component. It's a rich and dramatic white that should drink well on release and could well be very interesting with time in the bottle. The Deux Grenouilles was produced entirely from estate fruit with the exception of Chardonnay from Bien Nacido Vineyard, and it was vinified in 26% concrete eggs, 26% used barrels and 48% new oak.",,RP (98-100)
417,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Testa dei Cherubini,"The 2014 Grenache Testa dei Cherubini saw fully 37.5 months in wood, some 25% new, but its influence is imperceptible; the wine is strikingly pure and vibrant. Krankl commented that the longer the wines spend in barrel, the more slowly they seem to evolve in bottle. Unfurling in the glass with aromas of juicy red cherries, peonies and plums, it's initially quite reserved, becoming more expressive with air. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and very concentrated, with strikingly fine-grained, revolved tannins, juicy acids and impressive length and depth. Like the 2015 Le Chemin Vers l'Hérésie also reviewed in this report, it's remarkably pure and integrated and ranks as one of the finest Grenache bottlings I've tasted from Sine Qua Non. It's also one wine that will clearly benefit from bottle age, no matter how tempting it may be when it's released in November of this year. The blend includes 15.5% Syrah, 4% Petite Sirah and a tiny 0.5% of Viognier, and 895 cases, 228 magnums and 30 double magnums were produced.",,RP (98-100)
418,Sine Qua Non,Syrah Capo dei Putti,"The 2014 Syrah Capo dei Putti saw an amazing 38 months in fully 94% new oak, and it was showing superbly when I tasted it, unfurling in the glass with brooding aromas of blackberry preserve, cherries, bay leaf and a remarkably integrated framing of smoky new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, hyper-concentrated and deep, with an incredibly dense core of fruit that's definitely ripe but avoids overt sucrosity—and is complemented by an impressive degree of savory nuance. It's a blocky, dense Syrah that will merit some time in bottle, but it is sure to make a considerable impact whenever it's opened. 896 cases, 228 magnums and 30 double magnums were produced.",,RP (98-100)
419,Sine Qua Non,Syrah Trouver L’Arene,"Composed of 80.5% Syrah, 7% Petite Syrah, 7% Mourvèdre, 2% Grenache and 3.5% Viognier, all sourced from estate vineyards—37% The Third Twin, 36% Eleven Confessions and 27% Cumulus—the 2015 Syrah Trouver L’Arene was made using 34% whole cluster and has a deep purple-black color with intense cassis, black plums and black cherries scents plus hints of anise, violets, sage and tar, with wafts of savory/smoked meat suggestions. Full-bodied, this voluptuous beauty is seriously singing in the mouth, belting out vibrant red and black fruit flavor layers, all framed by very fine, rounded, ripe tannins and a wonderful freshness, finishing with persistent perfumed fruit and a spring in its step. 1,778 cases and 600 magnums were produced.",,RP (98-100)
420,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Le Chemin Vers L'Heresie,"The 2015 Grenache Le Chemin Vers L'Heresie is a blend of 75% Grenache, 13% Mourvèdre, 8% Touriga Nacional and 4% Petite Sirah, coming 35% from The Third Twin (Estate) Vineyard, 9% from Bien Nacido Vineyard, 28% from the Cumulus (Estate) Vineyard, 26% from the Eleven Confessions (Estate) Vineyard and 2% from Molly Aida (Estate) Vineyard. It was produced using 44% whole cluster and aged for around 22 months in French oak, 11% new (bottled August 21, 2017). It has a deep garnet-purple color and fragrant nose of violets, kirsch, blueberry compote and dark chocolate with hints of lavender, smoky bacon, Provence herbs and menthol. Full-bodied, rich, concentrated and bold, the wines bursts with energy, superbly framed by velvety tannins and seamless freshness, finishing with lingering sautéed herbs and black pepper notions. 1,204 cases of 750 milliliter bottles and 600 magnum bottles were made.",,RP (98-100)
421,Sine Qua Non,Entre Chien et Loup,"The 2015 Entre Chien et Loup is a blend of 44% Chardonnay, 40% Roussanne, 8% Petit Manseng and 8% Viognier coming 44% from Bien Nacido Vineyard, 30% from the Cumulus (Estate) Vineyard and 26% from the Eleven Confessions (Estate) Vineyard. No settling was done to the juices—they were fermented as “dirty” as possible and, as usual, they were not racked. This wine was matured for around 19 months (bottled April 12, 2017), in: 19% concrete eggs, 20% stainless steel, 20% used barrels and 41% new French oak. It opens with a positively electric nose of ripe apricots, pink grapefruit and green mango with notions of candied ginger, honeycomb, allspice and baking bread. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a wonderfully satiny texture and incredible freshness, cutting through the dense tropical and stone fruit layers, finishing with epic length and many layers of savory and spice notions. By the way, I love the name of this wine and just wait until you see the label which, I’m happy to report, has already (somehow) been given the all-clear by the TTB. 811 cases were made. Drinking deliciously right now, it is built like a brick house and should cellar gracefully for 10-12 years+.",,RP (98-100)
422,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Shakti,"The 2014 Grenache Shakti is blended of 88% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Touriga Nacional, coming 51% from the Cumulus (Estate) Vineyard, 18% from The Third Twin (Estate) Vineyard, 9.5% from Bien Nacido Vineyard and 21.5% for the Eleven Confessions (Estate) Vineyard. It was produced using 42% whole cluster and aged for around 21 months in French oak, 6% new (bottled June 21, 2017). It offers up a deep garnet-purple color and notes of dried Mediterranean herbs, dusty earth, Chinese five spice and rose petals over a core of red currants, mulberries, red plums and black raspberries, plus a waft of chocolate covered cherries. Full-bodied, decadently concentrated and yet very, very pretty in the mouth, it delivers incredibly fine-grained, ripe tannins and wonderful freshness, finishing on a persistent—totally disarming—perfumed red fruit note. 1,199 cases of 750 milliliter bottles and 600 magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
423,Sine Qua Non,Syrah Piranha Waterdance,"Blended of 81% Syrah, 8% Petite Sirah, 6% Mourvèdre, 4% Touriga Nacional and 1% Graciano, sourced from 34% The Third Twin, 35% Eleven Confessions and 31% Cumulus (all estate vineyards), the provocative, inky purple colored 2014 Syrah Piranha Waterdance was made using 26% whole cluster and hits the scent scene with exuberant, pure crème de cassis, blackberry cordial and blueberry coulis notes with hints of espresso, licorice, garrigue and menthol, plus a gorgeous underlying perfume of red roses. The full-bodied palate is oh-so-elegant and pretty, revealing very finely pixelated tannins that beautifully frame the almost electric intensity, culminating in an epically long, licorice and chocolate-laced finish. Too stunning for mere words and rude to even try—just drink it. 1,839 cases and 600 magnums were produced.",,RP (98-100)
424,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Jusqu' a l'os,"The 2013 Grenache Jusqu' a l'os was produced from 79% Grenache from the 11 Confessions Vineyard along with 18% Syrah and 3% Petite Sirah, produced using 89% whole cluster and aged for around 38 months in 51% used oak, 6% new French oak and 43% concrete tanks (bottled December 6, 2016). It displays a medium to deep garnet color and rock star vibrant red currant and black raspberry scents with hints of licorice, mocha, Indian spices and peppered salami plus oh-so-fragrant and seductive touches of potpourri and chargrill. Medium to full-bodied, concentrated and opulently fruited in the mouth, the alluring, velvety tannins support savory, spicy layers right through the long, mineral-laced finish. This is one drop dead gorgeous, femme fatale of a wine. 868 cases of 750 milliliter bottles, 223 magnums and 30 double magnums were made.",,RP (98-100)
425,Sine Qua Non,Chardonnay Pearl Clutcher,"The just bottled 2012 Chardonnay Pearl Clutcher is off the charts and up there with some of Manfred’s top whites. Coming from incredibly low yields and made from 100% Bien Nacido Chardonnay (from a variety of clones, and the first time this estate has released a 100% Chardonnay), it was aged 19 months in 92% new French oak barrels. It offers a kaleidoscope of aromas and flavors, with notions of ripe orchard and caramelized fruits, lemon curd, fresh baked bread and hints of toast soaring from the glass. Deep, concentrated and decadent, it has full-bodied richness, fabulous concentration and a massive texture that never seems heavy or cumbersome. I’d drink it over the coming 3-4 years, but it will evolve for longer.  

These latest releases from Sine Qua Non and Next of Kyn are at the pinnacle of wine, and it’s simply impossible to taste through these and not be blown away.  While I think the star of the show at the moment is the 2010 vintage, the 2011s aren’t far behind, and the 2012s should rival them as well. In addition, to give you an idea how these wines age, don’t miss the recent 2004 retrospective on these wines that was published at eRobertParker.com. We finished the tasting with Manfred’s Next of Kyn releases, and these are the strongest set of wines yet to come out under this label.

426,Sine Qua Non,Syrah Dark Blossom,"The 2011 Syrah Dark Blossom showed even better from bottle than barrel. A blend of 84% Syrah, 8% Grenache, 4% Petite Sirah and the rest Roussanne and Petite Manseng, this beauty was fermented with 17% whole clusters and aged in equal parts new and used French oak. One of the shining successes in the vintage, it’s a full-bodied, concentrated and layered Syrah that has awesome aromatics of blackcurrants, Peking duck, pepper, licorice and charcuterie in its seamless, thrillingly pure profile. As with Manfred’s other 2011s, the tannins are certainly present, yet they’re sweet, polished and have no hard edges. Give this beauty 2-3 years in the cellar and enjoy bottles through 2031.

Almost all Syrah (1.5% Roussanne and 1% Viognier), it possesses a slightly deep color to go with similar aromas and flavors of blackcurrants, smoked meats, toasted spice and ground pepper. Full-bodied, deep, rich and concentrated, with thrilling purity, ripe tannin and a big finish, it should benefit from short-term cellaring and evolve gracefully for upward of two decades.

428,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Dark Blossom,"The 2011 Grenache Dark Blossom is probably the best Grenache-based blend in the vintage. A blend of 75% Grenache, 12.5% Syrah, 11.5% Mourvedre and a splash of Roussanne (fermented with 11% whole clusters), it has a perfumed, complex style, with notions of black raspberry, cassis, dried flowers, white pepper and licorice giving way to a full-bodied, layered and seamless mouthfeel. There’s no shortage of fruit here, and while it’s hard to resist now, it has enough tannin to warrant short-term cellaring. It should knock it out of the park through 2029.

Rita Hills. Made from 77% Grenache and 23% Syrah, fermented with 25% whole clusters and aged 33 months in 11% new French oak, this beauty should flirt with perfection once in bottle. Cassis, smoked herbs, white chocolate, melted licorice and meat juices are just some of the nuances here, and it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, high, yet sweet tannin, and incredibly purity of fruit. I like the tannin quality a smidge more here than in the Dark Blossom, and this will have two decades of longevity.

A blend of 96% Syrah, 3% Roussanne and 1% Viognier, it was fermented with 16% whole cluster before spending just under 42 months in 100% new French oak. It offers an incredible array of sweet dark fruits, cassis, white chocolate, licorice and hints of bacon fat that meld perfectly with its full-bodied, seamless, layered and impeccably put-together palate. Given the wealth of fruit here, it’s amazing how this stays light, graceful and elegant, without ever seeming over the top in any way. While there’s no shortage of tannin here, they’re sweet and integrated, so feel free to enjoy this rock-star effort anytime over the coming two decades or more.

A blend of 75% Grenache, 22% Syrah, 2% Roussanne and 1% Viognier, all from the Eleven Confession Vineyard, it spent just under 30 months in 22% new and 78% used French oak prior to bottling. Locked and loaded, it knocks it out of the park with its cassis, licorice, smoked duck, spice-box and exotic herb-styled bouquet. The palate follows suit and while it has the expected depth and richness of the estate, it’s seamless, elegant and lively, with perfect balance, ultra-fine tannin and a finish that just won’t quit. It doesn’t get any better and count yourself lucky if you can latch onto a couple of these. It will thrill for 15-20 years.

432,Sine Qua Non,Ode To E (Grenache),"Leading off with the Grenache-driven efforts, and easily the greatest expression of the variety I’ve ever tasted from California, the 2004 Ode to E (Grenache) is mind-blowing stuff that will stand toe-to-toe with the greatest Grenache-based wines ever made. Coming from Manfred’s Eleven Confessions Vineyard and comprised of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier, it sports a still vibrant purple color to go with off-the-hook aromas and flavors of creme de cassis, melted licorice, graphite, smoked herbs and assorted meaty nuances. Full-bodied, seamless and elegant, with incredible purity and a perfect texture, it can be consumed anytime over the coming decade.  ",,RP 97
433,Sine Qua Non,Into The Dark (Grenache),"More up-front and open-knit, the 2004 In the Dark (Grenache) checks in as a blend of 84% Grenache, 8% Mourvedre, 7% Syrah and 1% Viognier that comes mostly from Manfred’s 11 Confessions Vineyard, yet includes small portions from Alban (10%) and Alta Mesa (9%) Vineyard. Reminding me of Clos Saint-Jean’s Sanctus Sanctorum with its incredible bouquet of sweet kirsch, licorice, dried baking spices, graphite and ground pepper, this beauty flows onto the palate with impeccable purity, perfect integration of its fruit, tannin and acidity, and blockbuster length. As is common with this estate’s wine, it’s the purity paired with serious richness that sets it apart. While still youthful and benefiting from a healthy decadence, I think it’s drinking at point and would aim to drink bottles over the coming 4-5 years. It will evolve gracefully for longer, but I see no reason to hold off.  ",,RP 97
434,Sine Qua Non,Ode To E (Syrah),"The 2004 Ode to E (Syrah) is an incredible blend of 94% Syrah, 4% Grenache and 2% Viognier, all from their estate Eleven Confessions Vineyard, that spent just under four years in oak. Boasting insane notes of creme de cassis, barbecued meats, licorice, exotic spices and singed cedar, this beauty flows onto the palate with a full-bodied, seamless, pure and incredibly layered profile that carries massive fruit and concentration, yet never seems heavy, overdone or puts a foot wrong. It’s the purity of fruit, as well as the overall seamlessness that puts this right up near top of the heap. Drinking perfectly now, it will continue to evolve gracefully for another decade or more.  It’s incredible juice and I wish every wine lover could have a sip (or a big glass) of it.",,RP 97
435,Sine Qua Non,Poker Face (Syrah),"Starting off the Syrah-based wines, the 2004 Poker Face (Syrah) is aging beautifully. A blend of 96% Syrah, 2.5% Mourvedre and 1.5% Viognier (from the Eleven Confessions, White Hawk, Alban, Bien Nacido, and Alta Mesa vineyards) that was aged in 80% new French oak, it offers up a perfumed, fresh bouquet of sweet blackberry liqueur, creme de cassis, spring flowers and licorice that gives way to a full-bodied, seamless, gorgeously textured feel on the palate. Rich and decadent, it has notable, yet beautifully integrated acidity and stays remarkably fresh, detailed and even elegant. It still needs a lengthy decant to shine, and will continue to thrill over the coming decade or so.  ",,RP 97
436,Sine Qua Non,The Rejuvenators,"A gorgeous white that didn’t start to shine until after two hours in the decanter, Manfred’s 2004 The Rejuvenators is a blend of 56% Roussanne, 24% Viognier and 20% Chardonnay, aged in 55% new French oak, that came mostly from John Alban’s site in the Edna Valley, but with 9% of the blend from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard. Light gold in color, with a rich, full-flavored and voluptuously-styled bouquet of white peach, white flowers, honeyed apricots and a tinge of marzipan, this incredible effort hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a thick, unctuous texture, and brilliant concentration, and no sense of weight or heaviness. Given the concentration level here, as well as the overall balance and freshness, it will continue to evolve for decades.",,RP 97
437,Sine Qua Non,Pinot Noir Covert Fingers Arita Hills Vineyard,"The 462-case 2004 Pinot Noir Covert Fingers is seamless and elegant, with a ripe, layered profile of sweet cassis, forest floor, licorice and ground herbs. Coming all from the cooler climate Arita Hills Vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills and completely destemmed, aged in 70% new French oak (the rest in 1-3-year-old barrels), never racked, and bottled unfined and unfiltered, it’s a full-bodied, beautiful effort that’s drinking at point. It’s in no danger of falling off a cliff and should continue to shine through 2024, although I see no reason to hold off.  ",,RP 97
438,Sine Qua Non,The Moment,"Starting off the tasting and a prodigious, unctuous white, the 2011 The Moment checks in as a blend of 57% Roussanne, 19% Petit Manseng, 17% Chardonnay and 7% Viognier that spent 16 months in a combination of concrete, new and used barrels, and stainless steel. Offering up notions of marzipan, citrus oil flowers, marmalade and spiced apricots, it flows onto the palate with full-bodied richness and depth that-s balanced by beautiful underlying freshness and clarity. While I would lean towards drinking bottles over the coming 2-3 years, these can absolutely age, and have upwards of 10-15+ years of longevity. Drink now-2017+. 

About as good as it gets across the board, these singular, incredible wines are the result of an obsessive attention to detail at all stages of the wine making process. There is no secret or hidden magic going on here. The incredibly talented and down-to-earth Manfred Krankl simply walks the walk as opposed to only talking about attention to detail or offering up the standard, wine is made in the vineyard comments. Looking at the vintages focused on here, 2009 has produced a decadent, voluptuous style that offers up thrilling levels of fruit as well as an approachable, heady richness that-s hard to resist. While they possess ample depth and structure, I would drink these before either the 2010s or 2011s. The 2010s here are stunning and have everything; gorgeous fruit, awesome concentration and incredible purity. While the most age-worthy of the recent vintages, they're a spectacular drink even today. The 2011s, which were all tasted out of barrel, have additional freshness and focus over the 2010s. They have solid concentration and overall balanced profiles that should allow them to cruise in the cellar.

439,Sine Qua Non,Syrah No Name As Of Yet,"Possibly the wine of the vintage once bottled, the 2010 Syrah ""No Name as of Yet"" is really something and got more than one explicative in my notes. Full-bodied, rich and layered, yet also seamless and pure, with fine tannin and perfect structure, it delivers thrilling aromas and flavors of blackberry, black raspberry, smoke, licorice and crushed rock that continue to develop and change in the glass. Scheduled to be bottled early in 2014, it-s one wine to not miss! Drink 2017-2030.

453,Sine Qua Non,White Wine No Name As Of Yet,"The 2011 White Wine “No Name as of Yet” is a gorgeous, focused wine. Bright veins of minerality frame hints of tangerine, honeysuckle, mint, white flowers and apricots. In 2011, the cold year produced a white of unusual energy and tension for Sine Qua Non, rather than the lush style that is typical here. The use of Petit Manseng (for the first time) also gives the wine an additional element of salinity and sheer brightness. I have to say, this is a style I find very exciting. At the same time, the 2000 The Hussy and 2001 Albino, which are quite a bit richer, have both aged spectacularly well, so it is pretty clear Krankl excels in all styles. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2021.  

(Not yet released)

Manfred Krankl calls 2011 the most consistently cold year he has ever seen from start to finish, although he adds that every year since 2008 has been cooler than normal. Unlike 2010, there were no heat spikes or even hot days in 2011. A bit of frost in April reduced tiny yields even more, but in retrospect that was a saving grace, as a full crop might never have ripened under the conditions of the year. Vintage 2010 was marked by a late frost that mostly affected Grenache by reducing yields. The rest of the vintage saw quite a bit of rain along with heat spikes during the summer, which produced big, bold wines. Krankl describes 2009 as a vintage that was shaping up to be great, until the rains arrived at the end of the growing season. With one exception, the 2009s are just as sexy and silky as they were last year. Unfortunately, the 2009 Syrah Estate No Name as of Yet was in no mood to be evaluated, so I will have to wait for another opportunity to taste it. In addition to these wines, I also tasted about a dozen library wines that reconfirmed my opinion, stated last year, that the Sine Qua Non wines have gained in elegance and refinement with the gradual move towards estate-owned vineyards. Sine Qua Non fans will find a lot to get excited about with these current and upcoming releases. I also urge readers to check out Manfred and Elaine Krankl’s newest project, Next of Kyn, also reviewed in these pages, and Sine Qua Non’s new website, which gives consumers a rare look at one of this country’s most compelling estates.

There is an inner sweetness and sheer depth that make the 2009 compelling. The 11% Syrah and 5% Mourvedre make themselves heard clearly in adding layers of depth and pure richness. Tar, anise and graphite meld together on the rich, dramatic finish. This is a striking wine endowed with tons of pure textural dimension. The 2009 was sourced from Eleven Confessions (72%), Cumulus (22%) and Bien Nacido (6%) vineyards. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2021.  

Manfred Krankl calls 2011 the most consistently cold year he has ever seen from start to finish, although he adds that every year since 2008 has been cooler than normal. Unlike 2010, there were no heat spikes or even hot days in 2011. A bit of frost in April reduced tiny yields even more, but in retrospect that was a saving grace, as a full crop might never have ripened under the conditions of the year. Vintage 2010 was marked by a late frost that mostly affected Grenache by reducing yields. The rest of the vintage saw quite a bit of rain along with heat spikes during the summer, which produced big, bold wines. Krankl describes 2009 as a vintage that was shaping up to be great, until the rains arrived at the end of the growing season. With one exception, the 2009s are just as sexy and silky as they were last year. Unfortunately, the 2009 Syrah Estate No Name as of Yet was in no mood to be evaluated, so I will have to wait for another opportunity to taste it. In addition to these wines, I also tasted about a dozen library wines that reconfirmed my opinion, stated last year, that the Sine Qua Non wines have gained in elegance and refinement with the gradual move towards estate-owned vineyards. Sine Qua Non fans will find a lot to get excited about with these current and upcoming releases. I also urge readers to check out Manfred and Elaine Krankl’s newest project, Next of Kyn, also reviewed in these pages, and Sine Qua Non’s new website, which gives consumers a rare look at one of this country’s most compelling estates.

456,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Estate No Name As Of Yet,"The 2009 Grenache Estate “No Name as of Yet” possesses tremendous lift in its aromatics owing to the inclusion of 34% whole clusters. It is a remarkably polished wine that impresses for its overall balance and sense of harmony. Nothing is out of place, but the wine is impossibly young, as it had been bottled just prior to my visit. Mocha, espresso and rose petals meld together on the finish supported by a vibrant core of minerality. The 2009 is 79% Grenache, 15% Syrah, 3% Viognier and 3% Roussanne, all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. A portion of the Grenache was fermented using whole clusters. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

Dark fruit, spices, licorice and violets sit on a core of firm tannin as this powerful wine opens up in the glass. Today, The Thrill OfYcomes across as very, very young. The intensity of the fruit and the oak are dominant at present. In another few years the wine should be spectacular. The Thrill Of... is 90% Syrah, 6% Grenache and 4% Viognier, all destemmed and mostly from estate owned vineyards. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

458,Sine Qua Non,Grenache The Duel,"Sine Qua Non’s 2008 Grenache Estate The Duel boasts extraordinary richness, power and sheer depth. Tobacco, leather, mint and spices are woven together in this large-scaled Grenache. There is plenty of intensity here, but the 2008 has just a touch less aromatic definition than the very finest wines at Sine Qua Non. I imagine some of that may be the result of extended aging in oak. The 2008 is 82% Grenache, 14% Syrah, 2% Viognier and 1% Roussanne, all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. A portion of the Grenache was fermented using whole clusters. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023.

459,Sine Qua Non,White Wine With No Name Yet,"The 2010 White Wine No Name Yet emerges from the glass with layers of succulent peaches, apricots, honey, hazelnuts and mint. It is a dazzling, texturally huge, rich wine bursting with exotic fruit from start to finish. All of the aromas and flavors come together seamlessly on the round, sensual finish. This tentative blend is approximately 66% Roussanne, 20% Viognier and 14% Chardonnay, from Eleven Confessions (60%), Cumulus (20%) and Bien Nacido (20%). The wine was aged approximately 30% in concrete eggs, 25% in new French oak, 30% in neutral French oak and 15% in steel. Krankl states that of the wines still in barrel, this is farthest from being finished and that this blend is still tentative and could change. That shouldn’t be too much of an issue, as the wine isn’t scheduled for release until November 2012. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2020.  

This is a breathtaking set of wines from Sine Qua Non and Manfred Krankl. It’s hard to say precisely to what degree a greater reliance on estate owned vineyards, generally cooler growing seasons over the last few years and a reduction in new oak are shaping these wines, but the bottom line is that Krankl is coaxing fruit of incomparable elegance from the sites he works with. The silkiness and polish of the tannins is breathtaking. I also had a chance to see numerous estate vineyards during my visit with Krankl and Cellar Master Jim Binns including the Cumulus vineyard that informs Krankl’s newest project, Next of Kyn, which is reviewed separately. That said, there are fewer more perfect matches than Grenache and Syrah as farmed by Krankl in the Eleven Confessions vineyard, which is located in the Santa Rita Hills, one of the cooler spots in California’s Central Coast. The wines that emerge from this site are often profound. The sheer drive for perfection and attention to detail at Sine Qua Non is something I have rarely witnessed anywhere else in the world.

460,Sine Qua Non,Grenache Upside Down,"The 2009 Grenache Upside Down opens with a gorgeous bouquet redolent of freshly cut roses, berries, spices and licorice, all of which resonate on the palate. Gorgeous focus and length are in full evidence as the wine takes shape in the glass, showing dazzling purity and class. Silky tannins frame the exceptionally elegant, racy finish. This is a striking, mid-weight red with a bright future. This Grenache based blend includes 11% Syrah and 5 % Mourvedre. The vineyard sources are 72% Eleven Confessions, 22% Cumulus and 6% Bien Nacido. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2019.

462,Sine Qua Non,The Duel,"2008 The Duel: Not scheduled for release until November 2012, this was a barrel sample of the long wood-aged Grenache in 2008. A hundred percent from the 11 Confessions Vineyard, and a blend of 80% Grenache, 17% Syrah, 2% Viognier and 1% Roussanne, this wine displays wonderfully sweet, floral, waxy notes intermixed with creme de cassis, black cherry liqueur, licorice, a hint of forest floor and floral notes. Dense ruby/purple, with great intensity, full-bodied opulence, and loads of glycerin, yet at the same time possessing a surprisingly light-on-its-feet personality, this should be a terrific wine that appears to be going from strength to strength as it ages in wood. 

The conclusions I came to about this tasting may seem obvious just by reading the tasting notes. People forget that as famous as Sine Qua Non and both Elaine and Manfred Krankl have become over the last 15 years, their wines really only began to hit full world-class qualitative levels at the turn of the last century (2000). The vineyard sources have largely changed from Alban, Stolpman, Bien Nacido, Shadow Canyon and White Hawk Vineyards to primarily estate vineyards Cumulus Vineyard in Ventura County and 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills. In the future, Krankl’s newest vineyard in Alisos Canyon will be an additional component part. His meticulous craftsmanship and phenomenal attention to detail, both in the vineyard and in the winery, have been increasingly noticeable over the last decade. He seemed to hit full stride about eight or nine years ago, and what has unfolded since then is an absolutely brilliant succession of true works of genius, both in his expressive, sometimes slightly abstract artwork on the labels,  to the meticulously crafted wood boxes in which the wines are housed. Of course, the most important thing of all, the actual wine itself, is both the beginning as well as the end for consumers, and where 100% of my focus and judgement are centered. Grenache, as Krankl would be the first to say, is by far the most challenging grape varietal to make majestic wine from, and unequaled in difficulty by any other grape in the world except Nebbiolo. That’s why we see so little of it from great terroirs. High quality Grenache exists in northern Spain, southern France, parts of southern Italy and Sardinia, and in southern Australia, but rarely in California. This makes Krankl’s achievement all the more remarkable. Regarding the article’s title, “Wasted” – I was so elated (by their quality) as well as depressed (because I couldn’t drink all of these elixirs) that it seemed as if too much wine had been “wasted.” On a light-hearted note, my condition once I finished the academic part of the tasting could have been described as “wasted” by those who still hold to the notion that alcohol is the demon drink.

Production ranges from 250-300 cases for the long barrel-aged Grenache to nearly 1,000 cases for the earlier released Grenache. Prices are in the $150-250 range from the winery. Tel. (805) 237-1231; Fax (805) 237-1314",,RP 97
463,Sine Qua Non,The Line,"2008 The Line: This wine was just released in April of this year, and is a blend of 87.5% Grenache, 11% Syrah, and 1.5% Viognier, with 21% whole clusters used in the Grenache component. Seventy-eight percent of it  came from the 11 Confessions Vineyard and the balance from Bien Nacido and the White Hawk. It is no measly wine at 15.5% alcohol, but it displays extraordinary berry fruit and kirsch notes intermixed with lavender and other floral components. Intense, full-bodied, voluptuously textured, and stunningly pure, with no real noticeable oak (21% new French oak was used, most of it the larger demi-muids), this beauty has put on weight and is showing additional complexity since I first tasted it. Anticipated maturity: now-2023.

464,Sine Qua Non,Syrah B 20,"The 2008 Syrah B-20 is a cool, inward wine graced with layers of beautifully delineated, chiseled fruit. This is a distinctly mineral, precise style relative to the more outgoing 2009, but both are striking. Floral notes add lift as the finish turns explosive with a burst of dark fruit, tar, licorice and crushed rocks. This is one of the more understated wines readers are likely to come across from Sine Qua Non. It is gorgeous when given the time to open up. The B-20 is predominantly Syrah, with 6% Grenache and 2% Viognier. About half of the Grenache was fermented with whole clusters and the wine was aged in French oak (60% new) for 26 months. The vineyard sources are 52% Eleven Confessions, 18% Cumulus, 18% Bien Nacido and 12% White Hawk. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023.

A whopper at 15.6% alcohol, this is the extended barrel-aged Grenache, spending 32 months in a combination of small oak casks as well as larger demi-muids. Absolutely magnificent, with incredible uplifted aromatics and great raspberry and black cherry fruit intermixed with blackberry, camphor, licorice and lavender, this wine is full-bodied, with super purity and a huge, massive mouthfeel as well as stunning texture and length. How Krankl was able to combine almost unbridled power with such extraordinary purity, definition and elegance is mind-boggling. This wine should drink well for at least 15+ years.

In the mouth, more white chocolate notes appear, along with meatiness and some silky tannins. Its great purity, density and richness make me think this wine could even improve a few points and flirt with perfection. This stunning wine should drink nicely for another 10-15 years.

A blend of 84% Grenache, 12% Syrah and 4% Viognier, all from the 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills, this is one of the most extraordinarily elegant Grenaches Krankl has produced. It is an intellectual wine, yet it doesn’t wimp out by any means. It is full-bodied and voluptuously textured, with notes of spice box, licorice and Provencal herbs, copious quantities of black currant and kirsch liqueur, stunning richness and a finish lasting close to a minute. This amazing effort confirms Krankl’s meticulous and nearly obsessively detailed work in both the vineyard and the winery. Anticipated maturity: now-2022.

468,Sine Qua Non,Raven Series (Grenache),"2006 Ravens Series (# 6 and 7 Grenache): This blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, largely from the 11 Confessions Vineyard, with a small amount from Bien Nacido, spent 21 months in barrel. It is really strutting its stuff now, and showing even better than my original note predicted in August of 2009. The wine has loads of meat, licorice, smoke, charcoal and graphite, as well as huge peppery, blackberry and black cherry notes. Full-bodied, with great acidity, nicely integrated tannin, an admirable mouthfeel and tremendous length, this killer Grenache is still young and probably 3-5 years away from prime time drinking. 

The conclusions I came to about this tasting may seem obvious just by reading the tasting notes. People forget that as famous as Sine Qua Non and both Elaine and Manfred Krankl have become over the last 15 years, their wines really only began to hit full world-class qualitative levels at the turn of the last century (2000). The vineyard sources have largely changed from Alban, Stolpman, Bien Nacido, Shadow Canyon and White Hawk Vineyards to primarily estate vineyards Cumulus Vineyard in Ventura County and 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills. In the future, Krankl’s newest vineyard in Alisos Canyon will be an additional component part. His meticulous craftsmanship and phenomenal attention to detail, both in the vineyard and in the winery, have been increasingly noticeable over the last decade. He seemed to hit full stride about eight or nine years ago, and what has unfolded since then is an absolutely brilliant succession of true works of genius, both in his expressive, sometimes slightly abstract artwork on the labels,  to the meticulously crafted wood boxes in which the wines are housed. Of course, the most important thing of all, the actual wine itself, is both the beginning as well as the end for consumers, and where 100% of my focus and judgement are centered. Grenache, as Krankl would be the first to say, is by far the most challenging grape varietal to make majestic wine from, and unequaled in difficulty by any other grape in the world except Nebbiolo. That’s why we see so little of it from great terroirs. High quality Grenache exists in northern Spain, southern France, parts of southern Italy and Sardinia, and in southern Australia, but rarely in California. This makes Krankl’s achievement all the more remarkable.

469,Sine Qua Non,The Naked Truth (Grenache),"2005 The Naked Truth: Manfred Krankl’s obvious love for his wife Elaine seems very apparent with the 2003, followed by the 2004 Ode to E, and here again, a sketch of his wife unclothed (sorry, back view only) appears on the label of the 2005. (I only know it’s his wife because I asked him!) A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah (any Mourvedre added to the Grenache is now a thing of the past), this wine, made totally from the 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills, is young, yet like all the SQN wines, approachable in its glorious display of fruit, purity and freshness. Dense purple, and offering up notes of cranberries, pepper, boysenberries, raspberries and cherries, a cornucopia of red and black fruits emerge from the aromatics, gently dosed with some spicy oak and Provencal herbs. Full-bodied, gutsy and fleshy, with loads of glycerin, a heady mouthfeel and a long finish, this wine has beautiful freshness and delineation, and should continue to drink well for 10-12+ more years.  How did this label get past the puritanical bureaucrats at BATF?

470,Sine Qua Non,Atlantis Fe 203 2A (Grenache),"2005 ATLANTIS Fe203 2A: Another brilliant 2005 (93% Grenache and 7% Syrah), it has put on weight and seems to be developing more complexity. California’s cooler year seems to have given all the top 2005s loads of perfume and distinctive aromatics. Oodles of kirsch, licorice, charcoal and floral notes along with some blacker fruit characteristics jump from the glass of this dense bluish/purple wine. Medium to full-bodied, yet extraordinarily elegant for a Grenache, with beautiful purity in its hints of white chocolate and forest floor and its admirably textured, long finish, this wine is still young but approachable thanks to its aromatics fireworks, yet should last for an additional 10-15 years.

471,Sine Qua Non,Li'L E (Grenache),"2003 Little E: Named after Manfred Krankl’s wife, Elaine, this blend of 78% Grenache, 12% Mourvedre and 10% Syrah was one of the first cuvees from the estate’s 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills. The rest of the fruit came from the Alban, Alta Mesa and Bien Nacido sites. Aged primarily in 300-liter hogsheads, this wine performed brilliantly in the tastings, starting a succession of prodigious Grenaches to emerge from Sine Qua Non. Fabulous fruit intensity, with loads of black cherry, black currant, licorice, incense, and some smoke are followed by a wine with good acidity, velvety yet moderate tannins, and a wonderfully layered, multi-dimensional mouthfeel. This wine is drinking great already, but is still a young wine, from an evolutionary standpoint a mere adolescent, and has at least another decade of sumptuous consumption ahead of it.

472,Sine Qua Non,Numbers / Letters,"2002 Numbers/Letters: Still very young, fresh and lively, with plenty of sweet and sour cherry notes intermixed with blacker currants, pepper, forest floor, spice box and some toasty oak, this wine is medium to full-bodied, fleshy, rich, still quite young, and seems very backward and a different style of Grenache than anything produced in the vintages that followed. I would forget this wine for at least another 2-3 years and drink it over the following decade. It is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah.

473,Sine Qua Non,Ventriloquist (Grenache / Syrah),"2001 Ventriloquist: This was the only wine in the entire tasting that refused to open and fully reveal itself. It is a blend of 82% Grenache and 18% Syrah, with much of it coming from the Alban Vineyard and the balance from the Stolpman Vineyard and the Shadow Canyon Vineyard further north. I would liked to have had a crack at another bottle, but this wine came across as very tightly knit, with far higher acids, giving the wine a more austere and tart quality. It did possess some nice, attractive black fruits, damp earth, spice box and hints of licorice and pepper, but the austerity of the tannins, which seemed exaggerated by the wine’s acidic framework, made this wine pleasurable but standing out as the weakest effort from Sine Qua Non in the last decade.

474,Sine Qua Non,Incognito (Grenache / Syrah),"2000 Incognito: This remains an historic wine and probably the greatest Grenache (95% Grenache and 5% Syrah) made in California up to this timeline. We were lucky enough to have this from a magnum at the vertical tasting, although I have recently had it from my cellar, as I have drunk the last remaining 750 ml formats I owned. A classic casebook in the glories of Grenache, this wine, which does have a little Syrah in it, has a dense plum/ruby color and an explosive nose of kirsch liqueur, incense, wood spice, pepper and earth. Ripe, full-bodied, and opulent, with a velvety texture, a magnificent, multi-layered, skyscraper-like mouthfeel, yet no sense of heaviness or any jagged edges, this is a glorious, voluptuously textured Grenache that scores high on all hedonistic and intellectual levels. I can’t see it getting any better, as it is fully mature, so owners of it are advised to drink it up over the next few years.

475,Sine Qua Non,Icarus (Grenache / Syrah / Viognier),"1999 Icarus: Still fresh and lively, and much younger tasting than the 1998 Antagonists or the 1995 Red Handed, this wine was certainly the biggest of the early vintages from Sine Qua Non’s Grenache program. The label says the alcohol is at 14.9%, but there is a freshness and elegance to the wine (80% Grenache, 18% Syrah and 2% Viognier) that would suggest much lower alcohols, for those who foolishly as well as erroneously equate finesse with lower alcohols. Structured, still deep ruby/purple-tinged, with fresh raspberry and black cherry fruit and some loamy soil notes, as well as hints of barbecue smoke and pepper, the wine is full-bodied, ripe, yet still somewhat tightly knit, suggesting that better things are yet to come. This obviously can be drunk now, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see it improve over the next several years and last for at least another decade.

476,Sine Qua Non,Antagonists,"1998 Antagonists: This was a surprising effort (93% Grenache, 5% Syrah and 2% Viognier) from a challenging vintage throughout California. The dramatically higher percentage of Grenache has given it a mature Chateauneuf du Pape personality. Loads of kirsch liqueur, pepper, lavender and spice box are all present in this elegant yet complex, extremely perfumed, medium to full-bodied wine. It is fully mature and should be drunk over the next 4-5 years.  The bouquet of this wine is stunning.

477,Sine Qua Non,Red Handed Proprietary Red Wine,"1995 Red Handed: One of the very first wines from Sine Qua Non with a significant portion of Grenache – in this case 43% Grenache and the rest 40% Syrah and 17% Mourvedre (the latter component usually eliminated from all Grenaches afterwards) – this wine is still alive, with a medium ruby color and the classic peppery and kirsch notes, along with some loamy soil and earthiness and a hint of wood smoke. In the mouth, one could call it elegant, but it lacks exuberance, and much of the fat and density of fruit have faded, revealing more acid and tannin in a slightly clipped finish. This wine was at its best in its first 7-8 years of life, but now is in decline.

The 2009 is more structured than the 2008, with a tannic backdrop, great intensity, and lots of orange rind, waxy marmalade, white fruit, and tropical fruit blossom-like notes. With excellent fruit, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and good freshness, this beauty should drink nicely for at least 2-3 years, perhaps longer.

After three decades of tasting wines from nearly all the world's greatest winemakers, many on an annual basis, have I fully understood what motivates them? For some it may be insecurity, for some others an overwhelming competitiveness, while for others it may be a ferocious fury focused on a single goal. Manfred Krankl and his charming wife, Elaine, are well-known to me. I have been visiting Sine Qua Non for over 15 years. This is a Horatio Alger tale of an immigrant (in this case, from Austria) who arrived with only a backpack to his name, and who in a few short years opened the finest artisanal bakery in Los Angeles ( La Brea Bakery) as well as one of the area's pioneering Mediterranean-styled restaurants (Campania - still flourishing today). However, Krankl's fame rests on the strength of his wines - compelling, singular, and world-class wines that are like no others being produced on Planet Earth. Is it his insecurity, his zealous competitiveness, a raging fire in his psyche, or merely a deep passion that suffers no fools or compromises? I suspect that even Krankl, in his most private moments, is unable to articulate what drives him to produce such magnificent vinous works of art. Some things at Sine Qua Non are etched in stone. First and foremost, Krankl works as hard in the vineyard as anybody. For example, a lot of wine producers talk yields, etc., but very few actually practice as small of yields as Krankl does. In 2007, his white wine yields were 1.28 tons of fruit per acre. His Grenache yields were 1.3 tons of fruit per acre, and his Syrah was 1.52 tons per acre. In 2008, he had a bumper crop by his standards, with white wine yields coming in at 1.74 tons of fruit per acre, Grenache at 1.66 tons, and Syrah at 1.70 tons per acre. There is a lot of phony baloney talk in the wine trade that low yields are not all they're cracked up to be, but talk to any top winemaker, look at any great wine; the unavoidable conclusion is (1) most are produced only from top sites, (2) nearly all of them are meticulously cultivated and looked after, and (3) yields are consistently low! Krankl's wines would never have the flavor or nuances they do if yields were two or three times higher. In any event, this was probably my last visit to his -Mad Max- junkyard dog sort of winery in one of the ugliest sections of Ventura. That will all change as his new winery on his estate property just south of Ojai, becomes a reality. I have mixed emotions about that as his old warehouse has become hallowed Rhone Ranger ground for me.  Nearly a decade ago, Krankl began to offer both a Grenache and Syrah that saw extended barrel aging. I believe he was the first Central Coast producer to institute that practice, and the success of this technique, practiced by Marcel Guigal since 1976, has been emulated by Justin Smith at Saxum and John Alban at Alban Vineyards.

479,Sine Qua Non,Kolibri Proprietary White,"The 2008 Kolibri continues the brilliant success Krankl has had with dry whites. As one can see when visiting his cellars, he is now using the fashionable concrete eggs as part of the white wines- upbringing. About 25% new French oak is used, and the balance is older barrels. Most of the fruit is from estate vineyards, with about 18% purchased from the Bien Nacido Vineyard. The final blend is 69% Roussanne and 31% Viognier. As is found in all Krankl's whites, the 2008 Kolibri possesses extraordinary aromatics. Abundant notes of marmalade, honeysuckle, white flowers, and candied citrus are accompanied by good acidity, beautiful intensity and purity, and a layered, fresh, medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. The wine is intense, but never heavy or overbearing. It is impossible to estimate which vintages will age well. I recently had the 2001 Albino and 2002 Lil- E and both were still brilliant. Other whites seem to go through a more funky stage from which they are unlikely to rebound. Consequently, as good as they are, I tend to drink them during their first several years of life.

480,Sine Qua Non,Jinete Bajo Vin de Paille (Roussanne),"The days of the Mr. K wines are gone forever with the tragically premature death of Austrian Alois Kracher, who had partnered with Manfred Krankl in this intriguing homage to sweet nectars. Krankl continues on his own, and in Spring, 2011, he will release the 2008 Jinete Bajo Roussanne Vin de Paille, which is named after his wife's favorite horse. Made from 100% estate fruit, with a finished alcohol level of 11.8%, a whopping 240 grams per liter of residual sugar, and 8.7 grams of acidity, this is a pure nectar of honeyed marmalade, waxy, syrupy honeysuckle, exotic creme brulee, and citrus. The remarkable acidity cuts through the extraordinary sweetness, so the impression is fresh and vibrant. Krankl has pulled off a marvelous balancing act with this cuvee. How long will it last? I have no idea - maybe 50-100 years, but given the fact there are only 235 cases of half bottles, most of it will be consumed before 2020.

481,Sine Qua Non,Labels (Syrah),"The recently released 2007 Syrah Labels (89% Syrah, 7% Grenache, and 4% Viognier) comes from the 11 Confessions Estate Vineyard (57%), a small amount from the home estate vineyard in Oak View called Cumulus, and the rest from purchased fruit grown in the White Hawk Vineyard in Los Alamos and the Bien Nacido Vineyard in Santa Maria. A sensational effort, it is performing even better out of bottle than it did from barrel. An opaque purple color is accompanied by beautiful notes of charcoal, acacia flowers, blueberries, blackberries, graphite, and subtle smoke. With great fruit, tremendous texture, and full-bodied power, it is locked and loaded. This cuvee should provide great drinking in addition to some provocative discussions over the next 10-15 years.

482,Sine Qua Non,A Shot In The Dark (Syrah),"The soon-to-be-released 2006 A Shot in the Dark is composed of 96.5% Syrah and 3.5% Viognier from the 11 Confessions Vineyard in the cool Santa Rita Hills. Performing better from bottle than it did from barrel, this prodigious red exhibits incredibly velvety tannins, a seamless style, and no noticeable oak (which is remarkable given the fact it spent 32 months in barrel). Dense purple to the rim with an extraordinary perfume of blueberry pie, blackberries, soy, Asian spices, and hints of forest floor and charcoal, this is a complex, rich, seamless, well-balanced tour de force in winemaking. A full-bodied, exuberant, unabashedly California Syrah, it will offer stunning drinking over the next 10-15+ years.

483,Sine Qua Non,Body and Soul Roussanne / Viognier,"The new cuvee of white wine, the 2007 Body and Soul, a 475-case blend of 71% Roussanne and 29% Viognier, is primarily from the 11 Confessions Vineyard. Krankl has dropped Chardonnay from the blend, and the resulting wine is a beacon for what can be achieved by blending two white Rhone varietals. About one-third new French oak is used. Honeysuckle, orange blossom, lemon oil, tropical fruit, and floral notes are found in this unctuously-textured white. Full-bodied and dry, with good underlying minerality, crispness, and an alluring freshness, it is impossible to know how such a wine will age. I just finished my last bottle of the 2001 Albino, which is aging fabulously well, and seems capable of lasting another 4-5 years.  These wines are so spectacularly perfumed and intense in their youth that they are hard to resist. 

Passing through what looks like a junkyard (or the first or second level of hell) to get to the warehouse of both bodily and spiritual pleasures called Sine Qua Non, is a hoot and a howl, but well worth it if you can somehow wrangle an appointment with the reclusive proprietor, Manfred Krankl. Tasting here is one of the highlights of my year, and all my expectations were satisfied if not eclipsed by what Krankl has made in 2007 and 2006. Oh, and there is one utterly perfect late-released 2005. Yields in 2007 were exceptionally low, with the Syrah averaging 1.5 to 2 tons of fruit per acre, Grenache 1.3 tons per acre, and the white grapes 1.28 tons of fruit per acre. Put another way, Krankl’s highest yields averaged a meager 1.05 to 1.55 pounds of fruit per vine. That in large part explains the compelling aromatics, texture, richness, and intensity of these wines. Add to that the compulsive viticultural work and fanatical attention to detail in the winery, and it’s no wonder Sine Qua Non remains one of California’s most remarkable reference points of world-class wines. The good news is that the first wine from the new home vineyard in Ventura County, the Cumulus Vineyard, has been produced. Moreover, the continued brilliance of the other estate vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills, 11 Confessions, is confirmed. Over the last few years I have not been able to taste through the Sine Qua Non wines without coming across one that merits a three-digit score. The final wines to be bottled under the “Mr. K.” moniker include the 2006 The Nobleman and 2006 The Strawman. As some readers may know, this partnership between the famed Austrian, Alois Kracher, and Manfred Krankl has finally come to an end because of the tragic death of Alois Kracher, who fell victim to pancreatic cancer at age 49. The Mr. K. offerings have been remarkable wines that showcased the talents of both of these great winemakers.

It possesses 295 grams of residual sugar per liter as well as remarkable acidity, sweetness, and richness, an inky/purple color, and classic aromas of cassis. In spite of its weight, intensity, and unctuosity, the wine is surprisingly delicate and nuanced on the palate.

485,Sine Qua Non,Next of Kyn Syrah Cumulus Vineyard,"The debut release from the new home vineyard on the steep hillsides of Ventura is the 2007 Next of Kyn Syrah Cumulus Vineyard. Composed of 96.5% Syrah and 3.5% Viognier, it sees only 20% new oak in its upbringing. From a six-acre parcel of vines, it may be sold under a different label than Sine Qua Non. Krankl had not made up his mind at the time of writing. In any event, it is a very impressive debut release that should be bottled after 25 months of barrel aging. Sweet notes of creme de cassis, camphor, acacia flowers, licorice, pepper, and meat are followed by a wine with fabulous intensity and purity, a full-bodied texture, and a long finish. Unfortunately, only 125 cases were produced ... from six acres!.

Despite its aging in 100% new oak, there is not a hint of wood to be found in the aromas or flavors. This remarkable sweet white exhibits abundant aromas of orange marmalade, rose petals, honeysuckle, brown sugar, and spice. It looks like 10W40 motor oil, but its ample acidity provides uplift and vibrancy to its enormously endowed, sweet personality.

The Mr. K. offerings have been remarkable wines that showcased the talents of both of these great winemakers.

488,Sine Qua Non,Raven Series (Syrah),"The 2006 Raven Series Syrah, a blend of 93% Syrah, 5% Grenache, and 2% Viognier that spends just under two years in French oak. Offering a dense purple color, gorgeous fruit, and a sweet perfume of graphite, blackberries, blueberries, charcoal, licorice, tar, and new oak, it is a dense, full-bodied, well-endowed, beautifully layered, pure Syrah that should drink well for 10-15 years.  

Passing through what looks like a junkyard (or the first or second level of hell) to get to the warehouse of both bodily and spiritual pleasures called Sine Qua Non, is a hoot and a howl, but well worth it if you can somehow wrangle an appointment with the reclusive proprietor, Manfred Krankl. Tasting here is one of the highlights of my year, and all my expectations were satisfied if not eclipsed by what Krankl has made in 2007 and 2006. Oh, and there is one utterly perfect late-released 2005. Yields in 2007 were exceptionally low, with the Syrah averaging 1.5 to 2 tons of fruit per acre, Grenache 1.3 tons per acre, and the white grapes 1.28 tons of fruit per acre. Put another way, Krankl’s highest yields averaged a meager 1.05 to 1.55 pounds of fruit per vine. That in large part explains the compelling aromatics, texture, richness, and intensity of these wines. Add to that the compulsive viticultural work and fanatical attention to detail in the winery, and it’s no wonder Sine Qua Non remains one of California’s most remarkable reference points of world-class wines. The good news is that the first wine from the new home vineyard in Ventura County, the Cumulus Vineyard, has been produced. Moreover, the continued brilliance of the other estate vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills, 11 Confessions, is confirmed. Over the last few years I have not been able to taste through the Sine Qua Non wines without coming across one that merits a three-digit score.

489,Sine Qua Non,Mr K The Noble Man (Chardonnay),"The 2006 Mr. K. The Noble Man Chardonnay (200 grams of residual sugar per liter) reveals phenomenal fresh, lively acidity as well as wonderful honeyed peach, marmalade, tropical fruit, and creme brulee characteristics. It is a Trockenbeerenauslese-styled wine that is a fitting tribute to the effusive and much revered Alois Kracher.

490,Sine Qua Non,The Hoo Doo Man Proprietary White,"The newest cuvee of white wine, the 2006 The Hoo Doo Man, is a 568-case blend of 39% Roussanne and the rest essentially equal parts Viognier and Chardonnay. This exceptional effort is a model example of what can be done with white varietals in California’s Central Coast. An exceptional bouquet of lemon blossom, nectarine, orange marmalade-infused honey, quince, and citrus are stunningly aromatic and provide profound richness, yet the freshness, precision, and overall lift are remarkable for a wine of this power and intensity. It offers a prodigious glass of dry white wine that should drink handsomely for a decade. In short, I call it “How do he do it man.” 

I don’t know whether it’s catching on or not, but there is a school of nonsense going around that somehow low yields are overrated. Of course, farmers who treat their vineyards like industrial plants, and wineries who do not control vineyards, or have accountants running the bottom line, are the usual suspects making this specious argument. From my perspective, thirty years of experience have always suggested that vineyards with the lowest yields tend to produce the most interesting wines.  Sine Qua Non has emerged as one of the world’s greatest wineries over the last decade, and low yields are part of the reason. Yields for their white wine varietals have gone from .91 tons per acre in 2003, to their most generous yield of 1.86 tons per acre in 2005. Their red varietal yields have increased from a scary, financially disastrous .32 tons per acre for the 2003 Grenache, to a whopping 2.11 tons per acre in 2005. In 2007, yields averaged 1.28 tons per acre for the white varietals, 1.31 tons per acre for Grenache, and 1.52 tons per acre for Syrah. (I did not taste the 2007 SQN wines, but other Central Coast 2007s I did taste suggest this will be a great vintage for this region.) When tasting wines such as Sine Qua Non, these statistics mean something because the Grenache is the finest in the New World, the Syrah begs to be compared with the greatest of France, California, and Australia, and the white wine blends assembled by Manfred Krankl are as sumptuous and complex as the world’s finest Chardonnays, even though there is little Chardonnay included in recent vintages, and there will be none in future releases. The ultimate “garage” winery, this operation’s back alley warehouse looks like a set scene from the movie Mad Max, but inside are the elixirs of dreams. Despite Krankl’s already lofty reputation, he continues to fine tune and build more nuances and complexity into his wines without sacrificing their intrinsic exuberance, purity, intensity, and individuality. I am increasingly convinced that no one in Australia, America, South America, or anywhere else in the New World makes a finer, more complex and compelling Grenache than Manfred Krankl. He is now producing two Grenache cuvees, an experimental, highly successful, long barrel-aged (40-43 months) effort, and a Grenache that is aged in oak for nearly two years prior to bottling.There are also two renditions of Syrah, a long-aged offering that is essentially an hommage to Marcel Guigal’s single vineyard Cote Roties (the SQN Syrahs are aged 42 months in 100% new French oak), and a Syrah that is bottled after 21-22 months in oak. These cuvees are rarely 100% Syrah as Krankl frequently adds in some co-fermented Viognier as well as Grenache. There are four sweet wines being made, but, unfortunately, the Mr. K. series will end because of the premature and tragic death of the renowned Alois (Luis) Kracher, the genius behind so many extraordinary sweet wines from Austria, and a partner with Krankl. In a year filled with some extraordinary tastings (2005 Bordeaux, 2007 Southern Rhones to come), this tasting at the so-called “garage d’or” on the back streets of Ventura stands along side the wine-tasting/dinner at the Great Wall of China as one of the two wine-tasting events of the year.

491,Sine Qua Non,Atlantis Fe 203 1A (Syrah),"The perfect 2005 Syrah Atlantis Fe 203-1a,b,c is a blend of 93% Syrah, 5% Grenache, and 2% Viognier, with 25% whole clusters. Whereas the Ode to E is all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard, this cuvee is a combination of 43% from the estate vineyard, 28% from the White Hawk Vineyard, 21% from the Alban Vineyard, and 8% from the Bien Nacido Vineyard. The good news is there are nearly 1,500 cases of this recently released offering. An extraordinarily flowery nose interwoven with scents of blueberries, blackberries, incense, and graphite soars from the glass. Although not the biggest or most concentrated Syrah Krankl has made, it is one of the most nuanced, elegant, and complex. It remains full-bodied, but builds incrementally on the palate, and comes across as elegant and delicate, especially when compared to many California Syrahs. Nevertheless, the intensity is mind-boggling, and the finish lasts for nearly a minute. Drink this amazing effort over the next 10-15+ years.

492,Sine Qua Non,Mr K The Straw Man Marsanne Vin de Paille,"Even more remarkable is the 2005 Mr. K. Marsanne Vin de Paille The Straw Man. One-hundred percent Marsanne from the Beckmen Vineyard, with remarkably low alcohol (7.5%), a whopping 392 grams of residual sugar per liter, and exceptional acidity (6.4 grams of acid per liter), this is one of the most singular sweet wines I have ever tasted. It rivals the great 2000 Suey that was made from Roussanne and ended up with 241 grams of residual sugar. The individualistic, prodigious sweet wines are the products of meticulous attention to detail, obsessive harvesting requirements, and amazing vinifications and upbringings. They are unbelievable elixirs, and this one is as complex and intense as any sweet wine made in the world. It is a fitting tribute to the genius of both Manfred Krankl and his late partner, Luis Kracher.

With 8% alcohol, 370 grams per liter of residual sugar, and 12.2 grams of acidity, it still tastes disjointed at present, but I believe it just needs time to sort itself out. Krankl told me that every cluster was hand-destemmed, and it took seven people two full days to destem 1.3 tons of fruit ... an amazingly laborious effort. Perhaps it is because it is a sweet red that throws me off, especially in the company of such legendary whites, but I could not get my head wrapped around it as well as the others.

To reiterate, it is a challenge to analyze these wines. I know they are distinctive, and I think I am beginning to understand why they are so much greater than just about every other Syrah or Grenache-based wine in California. In short, it is talent and incredibly meticulous hard work. No one works as hard or is as maniacal about a vineyard’s viticulture and winemaking as Manfred Krankl. Take that, add in exceptional talent, humility, top-notch vineyards, and I believe I understand the fundamentals of why these wines are so special.

Litchi nut, buttered tropical fruits, flower, and subtle wood notes soar from the glass. Rich, dry, full-bodied flavors coat the palate, but supporting underlying acidity provides superb definition to the wine’s mass and intensity. This cuvee, along with its younger sibling, are among the most profound dry whites being made in California. Hopefully they will encourage more wineries to move away from varietal labeling and create blends such as these. I believe that is the future for Central Coast whites.

In short, it is talent and incredibly meticulous hard work. No one works as hard or is as maniacal about a vineyard’s viticulture and winemaking as Manfred Krankl. Take that, add in exceptional talent, humility, top-notch vineyards, and I believe I understand the fundamentals of why these wines are so special.

498,Sine Qua Non,Over and Out Arrita Hills Vineyard (Pinot Noir),"Sadly, Sine Qua Non’s final Pinot Noir will be the 2005 “Over and Out” Arita Hills Vineyard. That’s a shame as their Pinot Noir has always been one of my favorites – always rich and full-flavored rather than a dumb-downed, wimpish, and diluted faux-French imitation. This beauty has put on considerable weight since I tasted it twelve months ago. Made from Dijon clones 115 and 777, it reveals a classic Cotes de Nuits-like perfume of damp forest floor intermixed with sweet cherries, plums, figs, and spring flowers. This could easily be mistaken for a Clos de la Roche from Morey St.-Denis, but with purer fruit and a more savory texture. Dominated by its beautiful fruit and complexity, with the oak component kept in the background, it should drink well for 8-10 years.

499,Sine Qua Non,Mr K The Straw Man Vin de Paille (Semillon),"The monumental 2004 Mr. K. The Straw Man, a Semillon Vin de Pays, possesses 9.9% alcohol and 310 grams per liter of residual sugar yet an amazing 7.6 grams per liter of acidity. An elixir of amazing proportions, there are 2,500 half bottles, which will be released in early 2008. Astounding notes of marmalade, creme brulee, and a liqueur of roasted nuts are accompanied by fabulous acidity, which provides uplift and vibrancy in spite of its enormous richness and unctuosity. The only thing I can say is you must taste it to believe it! I have no idea how long these sweeties will keep, but they should easily last for two decades or more.

500,Sine Qua Non,The Inaugural (Syrah),"The mind-boggling 2003 The Inaugural Syrah is an emotional experience to taste as well as drink. Aged 38 ½ months in French oak, it was fashioned entirely from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard, which is planted with Syrah clones #470, 174, and the Estrella River and Alban field selections. This stunning Syrah boasts a magnificent bouquet of spring flowers, blueberries, blackberries, charcoal, licorice, and roasted meats. It hits the palate with remarkable intensity, purity, and full-bodied power, but it somehow manages to dance across the taste buds with the gracefulness of a ballerina. Awesomely long, I still tasted this wine 60 seconds after I had spit it out – no easy task, even for a professional. This majestic Syrah should be a modern day legacy for Sine Qua Non, ranking alongside the other stunning Syrahs they have produced, such as the two 2002 cuvees, Just For The Love Of It and Heart Chorea. This is a nuanced, complex wine, whereas the 2004 Poker Face is more exuberant and flamboyant. It should age beautifully for 10-15+ years.

501,Sine Qua Non,Papa (Syrah),"There are 860 cases of the 2003 Papa, a blend of 97% Syrah, 2% Mourvedre, and 1% Grenache sourced from six different vineyards. An old black and white photograph of Manfred Krankl’s father holding a baby with a head the size of a large watermelon (presumably Manfred) serves as the label for this wine, which has just about everything one could want in a great Syrah. It exhibits extraordinary power and richness along with large quantities of sexy, seductive cassis, black cherries, and a chocolaty undertone. Unctuously textured, rich, and full, it will provide amazing drinking over the next 10-15 years. 

Vineyard sources are gradually changing at Sine Qua Non as a movement to 100% estate fruit from vineyards in the Santa Rita Hills and sites near the winery in Ventura County come into full production. However, at present some grapes emanate from other sources, particularly white grapes from the Alban Vineyard, and Grenache and Syrah from Alban, Alta Mesa, Bien Nacido, Shadow Canyon, and White Hawk vineyards. Yields were unbelievably small in 2003 (white varietals yielded .9 tons of fruit per acre, Pinot Noir 1.64 tons per acre, Grenache .32 tons per acre, and Syrah 1.20 tons per acre). In 2004, white varietal yields were 1.49 tons per acre, Pinot Noir 1.19 tons per acre, Grenache 1.04 tons per acre, and Syrah a whopping 1.48 tons per acre. Yields rose by 20-40% in 2005.   Longtime readers know that I consider these offerings to be about as remarkable as New World wines can be. They possess extraordinary richness and nuances as well as superb balance, purity, and aging potential. The whites are whole cluster pressed and go straight to barrel without any stabilization or settling, and everything is fermented with indigenous yeasts. No racking takes place until bottling, which is usually more than a year after the harvest. The reds are 100% destemmed, although Grenache stems have been utilized on occasion. One to two ton open top fermenters are used, and following a cold soak that can last up to seven days, the wines are fermented with 2-3 daily punch downs. They are kept on their skins for a maximum of 2 plus weeks. All malolactic takes place in barrel, and the wines are bottled 18-24 months after the harvest with minimal clarification. Manfred Krankl, a true believer in radical viticulture, practices extensive crop-thinning, shoot positioning, etc. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in both the vineyard and the winery.

The Straw Man, a 100% Semillon vin de pays, boasts ... get this ... 435 grams of residual sugar per liter and 9.2 grams of acidity per liter. The grapes were picked in mid-September and then air-dried until early November (approximately 50 days) before fermentation began. A monumental wine of great intensity, richness, aromatic complexity, and a honeyed sweetness and balance that are almost beyond belief. Frankly, I don’t know how elixirs such as this can be made, but they demand unreal patience as well as meticulous attention to detail in both the vineyard and the winery. Like all SQN wines, what one confronts is brilliant singularity and individuality that provide us - mere mortals - the opportunity to watch and experience a genius play with our senses of pleasure and intellect. Whether we ever fully comprehend them is irrelevant - it is the challenge and fun of the quest that is damn fun!

Its gold color is accompanied by huge notes of orange marmalade and honeysuckle, superb texture, purity and richness, and remarkable acidity providing freshness as well as definition. The residual sugar is a whopping 370 grams per liter and the total acidity is 13.6 grams per liter ... astonishing statistics.

505,Sine Qua Non,Heart Chorea (Syrah),"SQN’s Syrahs are dynamite. In 2001, Krankl began to experiment with a limited production Syrah aged over 40 months in new oak (a la Marcel Guigal’s famous Cote Roties - La Mouline, La Landonne, and La Turque). The second rendition of this cuvee, the 2002 Heart Chorea, is a Cote Rotie-like blend of 95% Syrah and 5% Viognier. Most of the fruit comes from the Alban and White Hawk vineyards. The opaque purple-colored 2002 Heart Chorea possesses extraordinary levels of concentration, intensity, and subtle nuances, a fabulous nose of charcoal, acacia flowers, creme de cassis, blackberries, pain grille, and espresso roast. Opulent, full-bodied, and super-intense, but neither heavy nor out of balance, it is unfortunate that production of this unreal Syrah is less than 100 cases.

With 11.1% alcohol, 236 grams of residual sugar per liter, and 7.62 grams of total acidity per liter, this wine shows a kinky, honeyed intensity with notes of caramelized lychees, honeysuckle, cloves, and peaches. Extremely full-bodied, with unbelievable sweetness as well as fabulous balance, it goes on and on. Like all of these Mr. K sweeties, it’s a meal in itself.

There are never any compromises, so it is no surprise that what takes place in these cellars is the transformation of a commonplace beverage into a form of drinkable art!

Manfred Krankl and his charming wife, Elaine (referred to by Krankl as “E”), are on a roll given what has emerged from their funky warehouse/garage winery located in what looks like a discarded Hollywood set from the movie Mad Max. Finding a bottle or two of Sine Qua Non is no easy task since virtually all these wines are sold to longtime mailing list clients as well as the country’s finest upscale restaurants. However, some relief is in sight as Krankl is beginning to get fruit from his own Eleven Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills. Moreover, he planted another vineyard in Ventura County on a bald outcropping that should produce some fascinating Rhone varietals. The upcoming releases all reveal Krankl’s magic touch, and like some of the finest wineries working with Rhone varietals, Manfred Krankl is a creative blender, recognizing that blends generally result in more nuances and flavor complexity than a single varietal cuvee.

Aromatically restrained by SQN standards, with coaxing it offers up notes of honeyed pineapples, minerals, and flowers, but it is much more timid than its younger sibling. Rich, pure, and deliciously textured in the mouth, it reveals more on the palate than in its aromas, which should develop more nuances with additional bottle age. Sadly, production of this brilliant dry white proprietary wine is a minuscule 250 cases.

A one-thousand case blend of 96% Syrah, 2% Grenache, and 2% Viognier, it is nearly equal parts Alban, Bien Nacido, and Stolpman fruit with a small amount from both Shadow Canyon and White Hawk. It boasts a provocative perfume of creme de cassis, toast, blackberries, licorice, barbecue spice, and exotic floral scents. Extremely full-bodied, with fabulous intensity, great purity, awesome length, and a finish that lasts over a minute, this classic is a must purchase.

The bulk of the grapes come from the Alban Vineyard along with significant quantities from Stolpman and Shadow Canyon vineyards. The wine spent 19 months in wood prior to being bottled with neither fining nor filtration. There are only a measly 110 cases of this nectar. Its dense purple color is accompanied by a spectacular bouquet of licorice, kirsch liqueur, black currants, earth, and notions of smoky toast in the background. A stunning wine of great intensity, multiple flavor dimensions, and a long finish, it will hit its prime in 2-3 years, and should age well for a decade or more.

A superb perfume of smoky hazelnuts intermixed with exotic lychee, honeysuckle, peach, and beeswax notes is followed by a full-bodied wine with a multilayered texture that pulls back in the finish to reveal surprising uplift, acidity, and lightness ... an amazing feat given a wine of this power, dimension, and intensity. It should drink well for another 5-7 years.

517,Sine Qua Non,Rien Ne Va Plus (Roussanne),"One of the most amazing dry whites I have ever tasted is the 2001 Rien Ne Va Plus. Fashioned from 100% Roussanne, and aged on its lees for an extremely long period, my initial image when I tasted it was of the great Barsac, the 2001 Climens. However, the Sine Qua Non wine is bone dry with no sweetness evident. It gains in both stature and aromatic dimension as it sits in the glass. At first, I did not like it as well as the Whisperin’ E or the 2003 Proprietary White, but after 30-45 minutes in a decanter, the Rien Ne Va Plus was a symphony of exotic aromas and flavors. Dense, rich, and full-bodied, with impeccable balance, superb honeyed richness, and wonderfully integrated wood, it is undeniably the greatest New World expression of Roussanne made to date. Another dramatic characteristic, its golden color seemed to lighten as it sat in the glass and sucked up oxygen. This is an amazing achievement! Sadly, production is less than 100 cases.

At bottling, there were 241 grams of sugar per liter and the finished alcohol was 12.5%. This looks to be the stuff of legends. Unfortunately, only 597 half bottles were produced. Will it age as gracefully as a 1921 Yquem or 1949 Climens? Who knows, but anyone who loves prodigious, individualistic wine and the nectars produced from meticulous, even obsessive harvesting and vinification concerns should make every effort to latch on to a bottle of this unbelievable elixir.

The good news is there are 950 cases of this compelling effort. With a “midnight” black color, and the viscosity of 10-W-40 oil, its aromas of violet/acacia flowers, melted licorice, camphor, blackberries, creme de cassis, and subtle toasty new oak are accompanied by a wine boasting terrific texture, good underlying acidity, ripe tannin, and a 60-second plus finish. This stunning effort competes with the 2000, and what looks to be Krankl’s greatest Syrah-based wine to date, the 2002.

Elaine and Manfred Krankl wage war with these bureaucrats every year, but the label is a work of art, and it is hard to believe they saw something “lascivious.” It’s the wine inside the bottle that is pornographic. Terrific stuff, it is one of the greatest white Rhone Rangers I have ever tasted from the New World. An awesome perfume of white currants, flowers, honeyed citrus intertwined with background smoke is to die for. It deserves a triple X rating. In the mouth, it is lavishly rich, succulent, fleshy, voluptuous, and so decadently thick that it is obviously an evil wine that will encourage illicit thoughts in the mind of any impressionable person who tastes it. At the time of printing, the new name had not been established, but I’m sure those readers on Sine Qua Non’s mailing list can simply ask for the wine the BATF thought was pornographically packaged. About three-fourths of the fruit came from the Alban Vineyard and one-fourth from the Stolpman Vineyard. A tour de force in white winemaking, it should drink well for 7-8 years, possibly longer.

A black color is followed by a seamless effort loaded with blackberry, honey, and flower aromas, and an extraordinarily long, concentrated finish. As with all great wines, tasting notes/descriptors just can’t do it justice. Among the recent SQN Syrahs, it is a strikingly elegant and powerful wine that has a decidedly French flair to it.

The 1998 Veiled Pinot Noir Shea Vineyard is outstanding. It reveals the vintage's strengths in its medium ruby color, attractive, sweet, plum, rose petal, black cherry fruit, and smoky-scented nose. Medium-bodied with outstanding concentration and sweetness in the mid-palate, elegance and balance, this wine should improve nicely over the next 3-4 years, and last for 7-8.

Full-bodied, dry, and thickly-textured, it should be a remarkable and individualistic white wine from Elaine and Manfred Krankl.

A thick, juicy, massive Syrah, it gushes copious quantities of licorice-infused blackberry fruit offering smoke, coffee, and meaty notes. The wine is mouth-filling, teeth-staining, and loaded. Its high alcohol (15.3%), glycerin level, and low acidity make it easy to drink, but I suspect it will age easily for 10-20+ years.

The 1997 Twisted and Bent (540 cases) is no wimpy wine. All of the fruit comes from the Alban Vineyard in San Luis Obispo. The 1997's blend is 60% Roussanne and 40% Chardonnay. This is white wine at its most concentrated. Light gold with a greenish hue, it has the unctuosity and nearly the power of chartreuse liqueur, but it is dry, full-bodied, and easy to drink in large quantities (I know). Its honeyed viscosity, and extraordinary bouquet of rose petals, buttery tropical fruits, and orange marmalade are exotic, thrilling, and altogether a treat to satiate both the intellectual and hedonistic senses. The fact that it is dry is an achievement given the degree of sugar at which these grapes must have been picked. Drink this wine (14.7% alcohol) with close friends and delicious food. This wine seems to have the ability to last beyond 2-3 years, but the fact is I never have any left after 24 months.

The 1996 Against The Wall Syrah is cut from the same mold as the 1997. The color is opaque black/purple, and the nose offers a combination of cassis/blackberry jamminess intermixed with tar, pepper, and spice. Thick, massively full, yet wonderfully rich and expansive, with admirable purity and mouth-staining levels of glycerin and extract, this full-bodied, silky-smooth Syrah is deceptively easy to drink, but I suspect it will age effortlessly for 15-20 years.

The massive, dry 1996 Omadhaun Poltron's 15.2% alcohol is well-concealed beneath this full-bodied wine's glycerin and unctuous texture. The knock-out nose of honeyed citrus and rose petals is followed by a chewy, remarkably pure, dry wine oozing with extract. I suspect it will become even more civilized with 12-18 months of bottle age, but I would opt for drinking it over the next 2-3 years.

The color is medium ruby/garnet, and the nose complex, with plenty of smoky new oak intermixed with plum, damp forest aromas, and berry fruit. Like many 1996 Oregon Pinot Noirs, there is a slight austerity and hollowness in the mid-palate. This elegant offering could easily pass for a classy Burgundy in a blind tasting. Giving the moderate tannin in the finish, it should improve in the bottle, but the mid-palate deficiency worries me. Drink it over the next 3-5 years.

The 1995 The Other Hand is made from 100% Syrah grown in the Alban, Bien Nacido, and Stolpman vineyards, situated respectively in Edna Valley, Santa Maria, and Los Olivos. Aged 18 months in oak, of which 70% is new, this blockbuster, opaque purple-colored wine offers glorious notes of black fruits (primarily blackberry and cassis), subtle smoke, toast, and licorice, and a whiff of plant material and spice. Full-bodied, yet gorgeously layered and nearly seamless in its flamboyant display of fruit, glycerin, and extract, this large-scaled, yet drinkable Syrah will benefit from another 5-6 years in the bottle, but it is already accessible. It is another example of why I think wineries in this region should be ripping out their Pinot Noir vines and re-planting with Syrah! Look for this super Syrah to age effortlessly for 15 or more years.

556,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Leroy's brilliant 2019 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis and blackberries mingled with loamy soil, black truffles and orange rind, framed by a deft application of creamy new oak. Full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, it's rich and muscular, with a concentrated core of fruit underpinned a generous endowment of ripe, powdery tannins and concluding with a long, mineral finish.",,RP 88
557,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2019 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is spectacular. Bursting from the glass with aromas of cassis, plums, orange rind and exotic spices, framed by a discreet application of creamy new oak, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and textural, with a velvety attack that segues into a deep, concentrated, layered mid-palate and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 88
558,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2019 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons soars from the glass with aromas of raspberries, cherries, blood orange, black truffle, burning embers and forest floor. Full-bodied, layered and velvety, it's deep and concentrated, with a textural attack that segues into an ample core of vibrant fruit and a long, expansive finish. Sensual and charming, to the extent that there's an ""underrated"" wine chez Leroy, this cuvée is it.",,RP 88
559,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2019 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is rich and unctuous, wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus oil, pear, waxy lemon rind, honeycomb and toasted sesame. Full-bodied, deep and textural, it's rich and enveloping, with a huge core of fleshy fruit underpinned by lively acids and chalky structuring extract.",,RP 88
560,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2019 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières bursts with aromas of raspberries, orange rind, rose petals, forest floor, exotic spices and incense. Full-bodied, layered and sumptuous, with an enveloping core of fruit complemented by sapid, even carnal nuances and framed by melting tannins and lively acids, its depth and plenitude transcend any exceptions for a communal appellation. Indeed, if only more producers Richebourg tasted as good!",,RP 88
561,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2000 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a magical bottle that's just beginning to drink very well. Soaring from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of peonies, spices, orange rind, plums, raspberries and smoked tea, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a layered core, lively acids and a long, saline finish. This wine, re-released by the domaine this year, will show brilliantly for more than a decade to come.",,RP 94
562,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 1999 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots shows extraordinarily well, unfurling in the glass with dramatic aromas of wild berries, cinnamon, exotic spices, orange rind and smoked duck. Full-bodied, multidimensional and muscular, it's hugely concentrated, its deep core of fruit framed by an abundance of powdery tannin and racy balancing acids. Long and penetrating, this is a memorable bottle.",,RP 94
563,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 1990 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is deeper, firmer and more muscular than the 2000 that I drank alongside it, but nor could it match its younger sibling for aromatic range, finesse or charm. For the better part of an hour, it showed brilliantly, delivering complex aromas of spices, wild berries, orange rind, plums, smoked meats and creamy oak, but later in the evening, the rather roasted quality that often distinguishes the 1990 red Burgundy vintage became more and more prominent. It's a medium to full-bodied, nicely balanced wine with fine, chalky structuring tannins and tangy acids, but in the final analysis, it couldn't equal the performance of the 2000.",,RP 94
564,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Soaring from the glass with exquisite aromas of rose petals, violets, cassis, raspberries and exotic nuances of clove and cinnamon, Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is full-bodied, velvety and mutlitmiensional, with incredible energy and concentration, concluding with a long and resonant finish. This is a brilliant wine that entirely confirms the fine impression it made when I last tasted it in spring 2018.",,RP 94
565,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Aromas of rich berry fruit, grilled game bird, spices and rose petals introduce Leroy's 2015 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a full-bodied, broad and enveloping wine with a rich core of fruit, ripe acids and powdery tannins.  Deep and concentrated, this Vosne-Romanée is more overtly sun-kissed than the Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières drunk several weeks later, yet the balance is impeccable for the long haul.",,RP 94
566,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones and grilled meats introduce the 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges, a deep and full-bodied wine that's envelopingly textural, its generous core of ripe, expressive fruit largely concealing the wine's powdery structuring tannins. Sapid and earthy, this is classic Nuits that is still not really ready for prime-time drinking.",,RP 94
567,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is still quite tight-knit and reserved, opening in the glass with aromas of cassis and wild plums, mingled with notions of smoked meats, incense, rich soil tones and peonies. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, built around an ample chassis of rich and powdery tannins and underpinned by lively acids. This is a muscular young Clos Vougeot that's long and resonant, but which is at least a decade away from its peak, even if it's sufficiently refined to be approached earlier.",,RP 94
568,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2013 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is a beautiful young wine, offering up aromas of red plums, cassis, smoked duck, exotic spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy but youthfully reserved, with fine-grained tannins, racy acids and a deep, tightly coiled core. While this is sufficiently structurally refined to be approachable now, the real fireworks will come with another decade of bottle age.",,RP 94
569,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is a stunning young wine, unfurling in the decanter and glass to reveal aromas of lemon oil, candle wax, dried white flowers, woodsmoke and a classy framing of noble reduction. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with the chewy, chalky phenolic structure of a red wine, racy acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. This superb Corton-Charlemagne has not merely years  but decades ahead of it.",,RP 94
570,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a tightly wound young wine, unfurling in the glass with scents of wild berries, smoked meats, exotic spices, orange rind and plums. Medium to full-bodied, deep and coiled, it's elegantly muscular, with huge reserves of concentration, lively acids and powdery tannins. Even if it's already very impressive today, this really needs a decade's patience.",,RP 94
571,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières is beginning to drink beautifully, soaring from the glass with an inviting bouquet of rose petals, blackberries, smoked duck, incense and exotic spices. Full-bodied, velvety and spumous, it's layered and textural, underpinned by ripe, powdery tannins and succulent acids.",,RP 94
572,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Wafting from the glass with scents of raspberries, dark chocolate, rose petals, candied peel, incense and grilled squab, the 2008 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is full-bodied, satiny textured and vibrant, its beautifully ripe tannin and tangy acids framing a deep, concentrated core of fruit, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. Anyone who has the chance to taste this wine shouldn't hesitate.",,RP 94
573,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru really blossomed in the decanter, shaking off a touch of reduction to reveal a stunning bouquet of citrus oil—lime, lemon—mingled with oyster shell, white flowers, green pear, nutmeg and wheat toast. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and tight-knit, with a rock-solid core, incisive acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. As usual, this is structured more like a red wine than a white. What's more, it's one of the white wines of the vintage in 2007.",,RP 94
574,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"An elegant rendition of this site, the 2006 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu exhibits pretty aromas of rose petals, cherries and candied peel. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, silky and precise, with a structurally delicate, tender quality so typical of that vintage—but which only foregrounds the wine's beautiful purity of fruit.",,RP 94
575,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Domaine Leroy's 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a brillant young wine, though it's still the better part of a decade away from even early maturity. Unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of black cherries, wild berries, smoked meats, espresso roast, blood orange and exotic spices, framed by a deft touch of new oak, it's full-bodied, deep and layered, with an immensely concentrated core of fruit, elegantly muscular structuring tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, carnal finish.",,RP 94
576,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Lalou Bize-Leroy's 2003 Richebourg Grand Cru is drinking exquisitely well, mingling aromas of plums and sweet red berries with notes of raw cocoa, exotic spices, candied peel, burning embers and subtle hints of smoked meats. Full-bodied, rich and expansive, it's a lavish, dramatic wine, defined by a deep and voluminous core of sumptuous fruit that's framed by velvety tannins and ripe but lively acids, concluding with a long and superbly integrated finish. This a striking, dramatic Richebourg that demonstrates the deftness with which Leroy realized all the potential of this extreme vintage.",,RP 94
577,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"This was the best bottle that I've encountered of Leroy's 1999 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru, unfurling in the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of dark berry fruit, cassis, smoked meats, rose petals, candied peel and sweet spices. Full-bodied, velvety and immensely concentrated, it's seamless and multidimensional, built around an elegantly muscular chassis of velvety tannin and a lively spine of acidity, concluding with a sapid and expansive finish.",,RP 94
578,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the wines of the vintage is the 2017 Musigny Grand Cru, a stunning young wine that reveals a bouquet of immense incipient complexity, mingling notes of raspberries and red fruits with suggestions of blood orange, peonies and rose hips. On the palate, this young Musigny is full-bodied, pure and precise, with an enveloping attack, immense depth at the core and exquisite structural elegance. The finish is long, mineral and beautifully defined. This is the most dynamic of all these young reds from Domaine Leroy, and it will reward considerable patience.",,RP 94
579,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is the least youthfully reductive young white I have ever tasted from Domaine Leroy. Opening in the glass with scents of crisp green pear, lemon oil, white flowers, toasted sesame and struck match, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and incisive, with huge reserves of chalky dry extract that are more reminiscent of a red wine than a white, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. ""This parcel ought to be planted to Pinot Noir,"" observes Madame Bize-Leroy, but I suspect that in such an eventuality the structure of the ensuing red cuvée wouldn't be all that different. Despite that structure and all the wine's energy and tension, this is a comparatively open, expressive vintage for the Domaine's Corton-Charlemagne.",,RP 94
580,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The profound 2017 Chambertin Grand Cru wafts from the glass with a deep and carnal bouquet that mingles rich aromas of blackberries and cassis with notions of summer truffles, smoked meats, espresso roast and baking chocolate. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with the most mid-palate volume of any wine in the cellar—its flesh and texture largely concealing an impressively ample chassis of rich, powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid. This is a decidedly serious Chambertin that will likely gain ground on its 2016 and 2015 siblings with bottle age.",,RP 94
581,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2017 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru reveals a beautiful bouquet of dark wild berries, exotic spices, wilted rose petals and forest floor, discreetly framed by a touch of new oak. It's full-bodied, deep and exquisitely silky, with a concentrated core and supple tannins that caress the palate before giving way to a long, penetrating and pungently perfumed finish. This is a quintessentially elegant, ethereal Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",,RP 94
582,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is showing especially well this year, opening up in the glass with aromas of wild berries, coniferous forest floor, cassis and dark chocolate, framed by a deft application of classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and incisive, with an intense core of fruit, beautifully refined structuring tannins and a long, mineral finish. Finer-boned and more reserved than the Clos de la Roche, this will be worth a special effort to seek out.",,RP 94
583,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Madame Bize-Leroy describes the 2017 Richebourg Grand Cru as ""civilized"", which I interpret to mean that this inherently supple, elegant vintage has tamed some of the climat's tendency to muscular power—an analysis with which I concur. Unwinding in the glass with complex aromas of cassis, dark berries, black truffles, rich soil tones and hints of rose petal and peony, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, with impressive concentration and rich but refined structuring tannins. The finish is long, sapid and perfumed. While I'm often inclined to give the domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant the edge over the Richebourg, the latter's elegance this year makes it more than usually difficult to pick favorites.",,RP 94
584,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"This cuvée is always one of the more powerful, muscular wines in the cellar, and the 2017 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is no exception. Exhibiting complex aromas of smoked meats, dark berries, rich soil tones, cassis, warm spices and black truffles, the wine is full-bodied, deep and structured, with considerable reserves of concentration and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long and mineral finish.",,RP 94
585,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is also spectacular this year, soaring from the glass with a striking bouquet of raspberries, cherries, rose hips, peonies and cinnamon. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and velvety, its envelopingly textural attack segueing into a deep and concentrated core, concluding with a long, precise and elegantly chalky finish.",,RP 94
586,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"One of the highlights of the portfolio this year is the 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts, a serious wine that unwinds in the glass with aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones, pencil lead and complex carnal nuances. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and multidimensional, with formidable depth at the core, an ample chassis of fine structuring tannins and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 94
587,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Notes of cassis, dark wild berries, sweet soil tones, black truffles and incense introduce the 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru, a full-bodied, multidimensional wine that's concentrated, deep and structured, retaining its habitual introverted profile even in this generally open-knit vintage. The finish is long and precise. This is a Clos Vougeot that will merit more than a decade's patience to realize all its potential.",,RP 94
588,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is one of the more brooding, powerful wines in the cellar this year, opening in the glass with notes of cassis, dark berries, smoked duck, spices and coniferous forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and muscular, with powdery structuring tannins, lively acids and a long, carnal finish.",,RP 94
589,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"Notes of cherries, cassis, smoked meats, rich soil tones and black truffles introduce the 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes, a textural and expansive wine that's medium to full-bodied wine, with an ample core of fruit, lively acids and a long, saline finish. Tasted after the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes, the more carnal Combottes represents a total change of register.",,RP 94
590,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a terrific success, offering up aromas of orange rind, red berries, spices and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and concentrated, with supremely velvety tannins, an ample core of fruit and a beautifully defined finish. Charming and succulent, this is a comparatively open, immediate rendition of Leroy's Corton-Renardes.",,RP 94
591,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Mingling deep fruit tones of raspberries and wild berries with exotic suggestions of Asian spices, rose hips and tea-smoked duck, Leroy's 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with powdery tannins, succulent acids and a deep, layered mid-palate. This, too, has turned out very well, though this year I'm inclined to prefer the Beaux Monts.",,RP 94
592,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is showing especially well this year, bursting with notes of raspberries, cherries, woodsmoke, grilled squab and rose petals. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with succulent acids, powdery tannins and an ample core of sapid fruit, concluding with a long and precise finish.",,RP 94
593,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Bursting with scents of rose petals, raspberries, cassis, spices and sweet soil tones, the 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes once again lives up to its name this year, its rounded and enveloping attack segueing into a medium to full-bodied palate that's supple and layered, its fine structuring tannins entirely cloaked in succulent, sapid fruit.",,RP 94
594,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is superb, and—as is often the case—I would argue that this is the finest of Domaine Leroy's communal bottlings this year. Opening in the glass with exquisite aromas of rose hips, raspberries, warm spices and sweet red fruits, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with racy acids and a long, mineral-driven finish.",,RP 94
595,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Aromas of cassis and plums mingle with notions of pencil lead, woodsmoke and rich soil tones, introducing the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu, a medium to full-bodied, velvety and succulent wine, with good depth at the core and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long finish. This is a comparatively giving, expressive rendition of Santenots, a cuvée that can often be a little introverted in its youth—indeed, I sometimes think it as the Clos Vougeot of the Côte de Beaune chez Leroy—though it still possesses plenty of upside.",,RP 94
596,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Exquisite aromas of wild berry fruit, smoked duck, exotic spices, peonies and loamy soil preface the 2017 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine with supple and powdery tannins, succulent balancing acids and a long, perfumed finish.",,RP 94
597,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berry fruit, spices and sweet soil tones that are discretely framed by a deft touch of new oak, Leroy's 2017 Pommard Les Vignots is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with powdery tannins, lively acids and good concentration at the core, concluding with a long and delicately carnal finish. This high-altitude, south-facing site always produces an ethereal, precise wine that's worlds away from Pommard's stereotype.",,RP 94
598,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Once again, Bize-Leroy opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges. The wine is showing well, opening up to reveal notes of cassis, grilled squab, rose hips and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, layered and attractively concentrated, energetic palate structured around fine and powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid.",,RP 94
599,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chambertin Grand Cru is a monument for the ages. Wafting from the glass with aromas of dark berries, orange rind, grilled meats, licorice and peony, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and immensely concentrated, with huge volume and amplitude, deep and multi-dimensional at the core, yet all the while remaining precise, vibrant and ineffably complete. Both the inevitable power and the essential elegance of Chambertin are fully realized in this timeless bottle. Whether this or the 2015 rendition is superior will be the subject for a debate that could last the better part of a century, yet the 2016's obvious stylistic affinity is with the 2010 vintage.",,RP 94
600,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"One of the high points of the vintage, the 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru captivates the olfactory senses with its striking bouquet of rose petals, citrus rind, cassis, raspberries, dark chocolate and sweet Asian spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, utterly complete and multidimensional, with satiny structuring tannins, immense concentration without the weight and a long, electric and perfumed finish. This is a magisterial achievement and a benchmark against which other wines may be measured.",,RP 94
601,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru is one of the more reticent wines in the cellar, reluctantly unfurling in the glass to reveal a profound bouquet of wild berries, rose petal, blood orange and ineffable savory nuances. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, incredibly deep and multidimensional, with extraordinary density without the weight and incredibly fine-grained tannins—but while this Musigny displays no structural asperity, so much is patently held in reserve that it's hard to read today. With bottle age, it's easy to imagine that this might end up being the finest of the Domaine Leroy's otherworldly 2016s, but over a decade's patience will be required.",,RP 94
602,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The extraordinary 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru soars from the glass with an irresistible bouquet of sweet dark fruits, baking chocolate, rose petals and exotic spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with incredible depth and volume at the core. Velvety and textural on the attack, the wine's powdery tannins are cloaked in a gourmand core of fruit, yet the lavish, expansive finish is beautifully controlled and precise for all its drama. Only in a range as exalted as this could Leroy's 2016 Richebourg receive so parsimonious a score.",,RP 94
603,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is brilliant, and one of the high points both of the portfolio and this great Côte de Nuits vintage. The wine unfurls in the glass with a captivating but youthfully reserved bouquet of rose petals, violets, blood orange, cherries and cassis, with only hints of the savory forest floor and spice to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and immensely concentrated, with an animating line of acidity that is classic Latricières, framed by exceptionally fine, powdery tannins, its finish long and unerringly precise.",,RP 94
604,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is one of the most exciting wines in the portfolio this year, unfurling in the glass with a beautifully defined bouquet of pomegranate, rose petal, raspberries, red plums and sweet spices, with only hints at the savory nuances to come. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and searingly intense, with a deep, layered mid-palate that's both more multidimensional and more structured than the Chambolle Fremières—a feat that had scarcely seemed possible. The finish is long, fine-grained and intensely chalky. In this frost-ravaged vintage, Bize-Leroy has produced a wine that tastes like the distilled essence of Chambolle Charmes.",,RP 94
605,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is just as stunning as the Brûlées, but more reserved and serious, unfurling in the glass with a less extravagant bouquet of cassis, plums, dark chocolate, grilled squab, subtle spices and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with striking amplitude and dimension, displaying a deep, searingly concentrated core that's framed by fine, powdery tannins. And if the Beaux Monts' finish isn't as expansive as the Brûlées', it's even longer and more penetrating. What's clear is that although the domaine's two Vosne premier crus touch, the wines themselves could hardly be more distinct.",,RP 94
606,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is striking, bursting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, grilled game, dark chocolate, cinnamon and violets. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and searingly concentrated, with a bottomless core of fruit, rich but supple structuring tannins, and a long, muscular finish. Above all, however, this wine is thrillingly vibrant, endowed with energy that evokes the 2010 rendition. It will need time, certainly, and it remains one of the more structural wines in the portfolio; but, if anything, it's less tight-knit than the 2015.",,RP 94
607,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru offers up a rich, brooding bouquet of cassis, wild berries, dark chocolate, incense and pencil shavings that are still quite youthfully reserved. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and layered, with immense concentration at the core, a rich chassis of structuring tannins and a long, powerful finish. Beautifully complete, this Clos Vougeot is predictably backward and tight-knit, and I suspect it will require more patience than any other wine in the cellar this year.",,RP 94
608,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a wine that speaks to the senses more than the intellect, soaring from the glass with aromas of ripe cassis, cherries and blackberries that mingle with lifted top-notes of rose petal and exotic spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and gourmand, cascading over the tongue with wave after wave of succulent, satiny fruit that entirely cloaks its satiny tannins, before concluding with a lavish, expansive but unerringly precise finish. I confess to a decided weakness for this Vosne-Romanée premier cru, a wine that's among the most viscerally thrilling in the Leroy portfolio.",,RP 94
609,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of citrus oil, beeswax, smoky pear, toasted nuts and an exotic top-note of candied angelica introduce the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, searingly concentrated wine that's structured around chewy dry extract more reminiscent of red wine, than white wine. Deep, concentrated and tight-knit, this is a stunning Corton-Charlemagne but it will require extended bottle age to attain its true plenitude of expression.",,RP 94
610,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"More reserved than the Vignerondes, the 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots unfurls in the glass with a brooding bouquet of wild berries, rich soil tones, Asian spices, dark chocolate and grilled game. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and broad, with considerable reserves of concentration and extract, framed by a large-scaled chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the long, stony finish.",,RP 94
611,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a particular success, unwinding with a captivating bouquet of rose petal, raspberries, orange rind and rich spices that are beautifully defined and multifaceted. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and fleshy, with satiny tannins that lend it a more than usually seductive aspect, though still underpinned by the bright line of acidity that always lend this wine is structure, concluding with a long and pure finish.",,RP 95
612,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is deep and brooding, unwinding in the glass with notes of wild blueberries, pencil lead, burning embers, cassis and grilled meat. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a broad-shouldered and firm but fine-grained chassis of structuring tannin fleshed out with deep reserves of fruit and savory nuance. The finish is long and sapid. As usual, this is one of the less immediate wines in the range and will need some time.",,RP 95
613,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is glorious, soaring from the glass in a blaze of red cherries, plums, rose petals and spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with incredible concentration without weight, rich but satiny structuring tannin and a long, vibrant finish.",,RP 95
614,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes bursts from the glass with expressive aromas of rose petals, berries and plums, complemented by savory hints of grilled meats. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and open-knit, with supple, fine-grained structuring tannins, a succulent core of fruit, and a long, expansive finish. This is an elegant and giving Combottes that's very true to type.",,RP 95
615,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"This year, Bize-Leroy once again opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the wine is incredible, unfurling in the glass with aromas of dark berries, pencil lead, dried flowers, rose hip and rich soil tones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, immensely concentrated and intense, with a deep, multidimensional core, vibrant acids and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 95
616,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"There are two barrels of the other-worldly 2016 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a wine that wafts from the glass with a stunning bouquet of raspberries, plums, smoked duck, spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and layered, with stunning concentration, powdery tannins and a long, pungently perfumed finish. It's a village wine that surpasses plenty of lesser producers' grands crus.",,RP 95
617,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Bursting from the glass with an arresting bouquet of rose petals, raspberries, dried flowers and dark chocolate, the 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is medium to full-bodied, satiny and immensely concentrated, its fine tannins are entirely hidden in a deep core of fruit, its finish long, pure and unmistakably mineral. It's quintessentially Chambolle, but this singular vintage is unusually intense, even by Leroy's standards.",,RP 95
618,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes offers up aromas of wild berries, spices, dried flowers and sweet soil tones, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional palate, its delicately chalky tannins cloaked in a fleshy core of fruit that lives up to the climat's name, concluding with a long and perfumed finish.",,RP 95
619,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Aromas of spicy wild berries, grilled meat and forest floor introduce the superb 2016 Pommard Les Vignots, a medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated wine with a deep, tight-knit core, powerful structuring tannins and a lovely line of animating acidity. More reserved than the gourmand 2015 rendition, this will be less approachable out of the gates and is more obviously defined by its high-altitude site.",,RP 95
620,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2010 Chambertin Grand Cru is spectacular, bursting from the glass with a youthful bouquet of rich red and black fruits, burning embers, rose petal and licorice, subtly framed by a discreet application of new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with satiny tannins, a concentrated core of fruit and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Of all Leroy's 2010s, this demands the most additional cellaring, and I suspect it will also prove to be the longest lived. This monumental wine is a reminder that Chambertin is not the greatest of the commune's grands crus by virtue of its power but rather thanks to its ineffable completeness and elegance.",,RP 95
621,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2010 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is spectacular, unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of wild red berries, potpourri, smoked duck and exotic spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with utterly suave structuring tannins and a superb line of acidity that lends the wine immense length and focus—in contrast to the broader, more expansive and gourmand Richebourg served alongside it. This is a real highlight of the 2010 portfolio and I suspect it is holding a great deal in reserve to be revealed over the coming decade and beyond.",,RP 95
622,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Notes of lemon oil, nutmeg and sesame mingle with lime zest and white truffle in a complex mélange, introducing the 2010 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firmly structured, with immense concentration, tension and substance. Like the whites from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it, this Corton-Charlemagne exhibits a phenolic frame that wouldn't be out of place in a red wine, and it requires the best part of another decade of cellaring.",,RP 95
623,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Notes of smoked duck, rich black fruits and Asian spices introduce the 2010 Richebourg Grand Cru, an ample, full-bodied wine with a gourmand core of fruit that largely conceals its satiny tannins, underpinned by tangy balancing acids. The finish is long and sapid. The Richebourg is more dramatic and expansive than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, but it isn't quite as focused and elegant.",,RP 95
624,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2010 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is already comparatively expressive today, wafting from the glass with aromas of red berries, cassis, incense and musk, with bass notes of sweet grilled meat emerging with time in the glass. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and bright, built around a beautiful line of racy acidity and framed by fine-grained, delicately chalky tannins. It's very intense and long.",,RP 95
625,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is very special, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of raw cocoa, Asian spices, ripe plums, rose petal and potpourri. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and perfumed, with a gourmand, layered mid-palate, melting tannins and a long, beautifully delineated finish. In recent vintages, I've tended to prefer the Domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant to its Richebourg, but in 1999 it's the latter that has the edge.",,RP 95
626,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 1999 Chambertin Grand Cru is a rich, dramatic wine, bursting with aromas of sweet cassis, rich soil, cedary new oak and incense. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and textural, with a firm chassis of structuring tannins and a long, stony finish. This Chambertin isn't as seamless or weightlessly intense as more recent vintages from Domaine Leroy, but it's a very exciting wine.",,RP 95
627,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"A rich, dramatic wine, the 1999 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru bursts with aromas of caramelized citrus, pear, verbena flowers and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and powerful, with chewy extract and structure, displaying immense concentration and stony depth. It's still shockingly youthful, so I may be underestimating it, but I didn't find it quite as complete or profound as the two 1999s from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it.",,RP 95
628,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 1999 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru was the one wine in the range that seemed a little fatigued, offering up aromas of dried red berries, candied peel, sweet spices and camphor, with a light framing of new oak still in evidence. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, firm and chalky, without the multidimensional completeness and seamless integration that the domaine so routinely attains.",,RP 95
629,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is one of the most magical wines to be found in Burgundy in this vintage, soaring from the glass with a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, featuring notes of rose petal, blood orange, potpourri and bright berry fruit, with only hints of the savory complexity to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is deep, full-bodied and extraordinarily multifaceted, with immense concentration, incredible energy and a long, resonating finish. Both more elegant and more reserved than the gloriously dramatic Richebourg that followed it, this is a profound Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",,RP 95
630,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Chambertin Grand Cru soars from the glass with a profound bouquet of cassis, cherry, raspberry, rose hip, grilled meat, spice and cedar. On the palate, the full extent of this wine's stunning amplitude and depth—and the reserves of energy that lie behind them—defy description. That a wine of such scale and concentration should be so seamless and complete is hard to fathom. The ecstatic commentary scribbled in my notebook concludes with the phrase ""essence of wine.""",,RP 95
631,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The utterly profound 2015 Musigny Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy, the crowning achievement to an extraordinary portfolio and a wine that brought tears to my eyes, wafts from the glass with a deep bouquet of black raspberry, cherry, rose petal and spice. On the palate, the wine is bottomless and multidimensional, with satiny tannins and fruit of crystalline purity, so utterly harmonious and structurally complete as to border on the ineffable—and certainly to exhaust any tired superlatives. The finish is incredibly penetrating and persistent.",,RP 95
632,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is an extraordinary wine that captures all the lavishness and power of this great grand cru, soaring from the glass with a deep bouquet of ripe black fruits, exotic spice, licorice and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is huge and multidimensional, with extraordinary concentration and mid-palate depth, vibrant and full of energy despite its imposing scale. Such is the intensity of its finish that neither swallowing nor expectoration have any immediate impact: it's as if the wine's still there. While this will never have the complexity or elegance of the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, it represents the essence of Richebourg.",,RP 95
633,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is one of the highlights in Domaine Leroy's formidable portfolio, soaring from the glass with an extroverted but almost ineffably complex bouquet of ripe blackberry, peony, game bird and wood smoke. On the palate, the wine is extraordinarily velvety and grand, with a lavish attack, a layered and multidimensional mid-palate and a long, saline finish—scintillatingly energetic despite the ripe, dramatic profile so typical of this climat. If there were ever any doubts about whether Aux Brûlées is one of Vosne-Romanée's finest premier crus, this bottle will dispel them. For now, the wine hasn't shut down, and I expect it to offer a very broad drinking window.",,RP 95
634,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is spectacular, wafting from the glass with notes of rose petal, black cherry, cassis, rich spices and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is silky, elegant and multidimensional—a world away from the assertive structure of its near-neighbor Clos de la Roche—with silky tannins, superb concentration and a vibrant, saline finish. For all its intensity of flavor, this Latricières is a delicate, transparent wine that fully realizes this grand cru's potential.",,RP 95
635,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a wine for the ages, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of incense, smoky black fruits, red cherry and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firm at the core, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins, excellent concentration and a firm, structural finish. Of all the Domaine Leroy 2015s, this—along with the Clos de la Roche—will demand the most extended cellaring.",,RP 95
636,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Like the Clos de Vougeot, the 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is built for the ages, opening in the glass with a bouquet of red-black berries, cherries, wood smoke, pencil shavings and incipient suggestions of soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and firm, with an ample and assertive chassis of chalky tannins, formidable power and concentration, with a long, grippy finish. This is cut from very different cloth than the Musigny that preceded it in our tasting, but it is taut rather than hard: the only missing ingredient is time.",,RP 95
637,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is spellbindingly wonderful, wafting from the glass with notes of cherry, raspberry, red plum, peony, lapsang tea and sweet spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and effortlessly complete, with incredible perfume, superb concentration and incredible length on the saline, penetrating finish. Of all Leroy's premier crus, this wine is the hardest to describe, since it's defined above all by its grace and harmony.",,RP 95
638,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots from Lalou Bize-Leroy is an extraordinary rendition of this great vineyard, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of sweet spices, dark fruit—plum, cherry—and rose petal that's both more exotic and less savory than this year's Vignerondes. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with grand cru depth and dimension, its authoritative chassis of fine-grained tannin only asserting itself on the firm, saline finish. In contrast to the giving Vignerondes, this Boudots is decidedly more brooding and structurally reserved, and it will need a decade in the cellar and benefit from longer.",,RP 95
639,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes offers up a deep-pitched bouquet of wild berries, spice, orange peel and grilled meat. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and multidimensional, with a fine-grained chassis of tannin that's more assertive than the structuring elements of the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes or the Vosne Aux Brulées and which nods to the authority of Clos de la Roche in its profile. The finish is long, ripe and sapid.",,RP 95
640,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy offers up a pretty nose of red cherry, raspberry, lapsang tea and rose hip, with none of the more feral aromas that sometimes seem to earn this climat its soubriquet. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and concentrated, built around a chalky chassis of tannin and a bright, vertical line of acidity. This will need some time in the cellar, but it should emerge as a beautifully elegant example of Corton.",,RP 95
641,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy opens in the glass with a bright bouquet of apple, lemon oil, wheat toast and smoke, framed by light reduction. On the palate, the wine is incredibly concentrated and intense, with a formidable structure and chalky extract that would be more familiar in a red wine and has a long, intense, almost searing finish. This was cropped at a mere 15 hectoliters per hectare, but while Chardonnay at yields like this can become overbearing, this Corton-Charlemagne—even in this sunny vintage—avoids any excess of weight or any trace of corpulence. It's built for the long haul.",,RP 95
642,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons bursts from the glass with a deep bouquet of plums, red berries, grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is broad and velvety, its tannins entirely hidden in a sapid core of fruit, its underpinning acids bright and vibrant and its finish long. This Savigny's structural finesse is as striking as its marriage of bright fruit with kaleidoscopic savory nuance.",,RP 95
643,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu from Domaine Leroy is one of the more brooding, reserved wines in the portfolio this year, opening in the glass with notes of plums, inky dark berries and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and powerful, with immense concentration and a velvety but firm chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the chalky, authoritative finish. This will take time to realize all its potential, but at maturity this score is likely to look conservative.",,RP 95
644,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes from Domaine Leroy is a wonderful wine, offering up an expressive bouquet of cassis, game bird, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is more structurally giving than the Boudots from further north along the slope, with silky tannins, a deep core of concentrated fruit and an incredibly long, saline finish. This was cropped at a mere 13.95 hectoliters per hectare, but—as with all the Domaine Leroy wines—that translates into intensity but never heaviness.",,RP 95
645,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2015 Pommard Les Vignots is fabulous, soaring from the glass with a complex bouquet of peony, sweet plum, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a deep core of crunchy fruit, racy acids and a wonderful sense of completeness. In Leroy's hands, this cool lieu-dit high on the slope above the village of Pommard has really excelled in this vintage.",,RP 95
646,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"The 2008 Nuits-Saint-Georges Villages from Domaine Leroy is beginning to drink very well, bursting from the glass with a complex bouquet of cinnamon, blood orange, peony, cassis, blackberry and raw cocoa. On the palate, the wine is sappy, expansive and medium-full, with an ample mid-palate, fine-grained tannins and a penetrating, saline finish—weightless but intense. In this vintage Bize-Leroy opted to combine the Nuits lieux-dits that she usually bottles separately: Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières.",,RP 95
647,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 1999 Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Allots from Leroy was still very powerful on the nose with ""thickset"" red berry fruit, a hint of blue fruit and a struck match scent that did not quite fit in. The palate is again powerful and dense, in my opinion my reflective of the 1999 growing season rather than the terroir, a village cru straining to flex its muscles and be treated as a premier cru. You admire that ambition, and yet it never quite achieves the nuance and complexity on the finish that would convince you of that. It is undeniably a delicious Aux Allots but one that did not trigger an intellectual or emotional response. Tasted January 2017.",,RP 95
648,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1988 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy was, of course, the debut vintage released under Lalou Bize-Leroy's name. Now at 28 years of age, it is probably beginning its descent from its peak in the 1990s although it continues to give drinking pleasure. Deep in color for the vintage, it offers pleasant cranberry, undergrowth, crushed violet petal and clove aromas that feel a little ""dimmed"" by the passing years. The palate is a little chunky compared to more recent vintages that I have tasted, quite tart in the mouth and conveying an almost Bordeaux-like structure on the finish that now feels a little short. Any bottles should be consumed in the near future because it is in gentle decline, albeit from a high peak. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 95
649,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"It has been almost 15 years since I last tasted the 1989 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts. This was an impressive showing for a 27-year-old wine that comes from one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's earliest vintages of her domaine. It has a beautiful pixelated bouquet with strawberry preserve, sous-bois, morels and autumn leaves. This is sleek and sensual. The palate is medium-bodied with pitch-perfect acidity, still surprisingly youthful, long and quite plush in the mouth with plenty of vigour on the refined finish. It appears to be maturing at a glacial pace. This is a supremely well-crafted wine from what was a hit and miss Burgundy vintage. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 95
650,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2002 Richebourg Grand Cru must surely be Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest wine of the vintage. It has more class than the 2002 Latricières-Chambertin--pure wild strawberry and black truffle on the nose that gathers momentum with each ticking hand of the clock as if to say: ""You want more?"" Of course you do. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin. There is great depth here as one expects from a Richebourg, not a powerful grand cru because this vintage was all about the nuance and delicacy, but it fans out wondrously on the finish with crushed strawberry and hints of cured meats. Very long, very elegant, very Leroy. This is an absolute treat. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
651,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2002 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts displayed a tensile, energetic bouquet that appeared to possess more focus than a 1989 Beaux Monts from Lalou that I had tasted a few days earlier. The aromatics are heavenly--mulberry, maraschino cherry, tobacco and a hint of seaweed, all beautifully defined and still surprisingly youthful. The palate is sensual, refined and backward. There is real vibrancy to this Beaux Monts, notes of raspberry coulis, red cherries and a touch of cola. It gently fans out on the finish, caressing in texture, refined and pure. I wonder whether this will actually improve with further bottle age? I suspect it has reached its plateau, but will continue giving drinking pleasure for many years.",,RP 95
652,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2002 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is a very fine contribution to the vintage courtesy of Lalou Bize-Leroy. It has a tensile bouquet with edgy black cherry, dark chocolate and undergrowth notes, holding something back at first but then getting into its stride with a few minutes in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly brittle tannin (something that I occasionally find in this grand cru.) Yes, it is a touch foursquare, ""correct"" compared the more sensual 2002 Vosne Beaux Monts, but the energy and focus win you over. Drink now, but don't be afraid to cellar this for another 15 to 20 years. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
653,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2002 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes has a lucid color. The nose sprints from the blocks with lively bing cherry, mulberry and black truffle scents, perhaps a little more loose-knit than I expected yet still exuding charm. The palate is very well balanced, quite evolved compared to Lalou Bize-Leroy's other 2002s with a gravel-tinged, slightly ferrous nose . While it does not possess the complexity of its peers, this is simply a delicious, warm-hearted Chambolle-Musigny to drink now and over the next 5-10 years. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
654,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1997 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Leroy is a decent white Burgundy, but its intrinsic quality did not size up to its reputation on this occasion. The nose is slightly reduced, but felt a little straightforward with citrus lemon and flinty aromas. It was just missing a little ""fatness"" you seek from this grand cru. The palate is balanced with a keen line of acidity, though it never soars, remaining a little broody and sultry. It opens with time in the glass, but I noticed a touch of warmth on the back of the throat and so I would drink this in the near future. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
655,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru is more backward than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment (the opposite to Hudelot-Noëllat the previous day when it was the other way round). Here, there is a very subtle marine/seaweed influence that tinctures that dark berry fruit. The palate is defined by its very fine tannin, the focus and tension interwoven through every atom of this Richebourg; the finish is surfeit with nervosité and tension so that is slips down the throat (guilty!) with so much ease. Wonderful -- one of the wines of the vintage.",,RP 95
656,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée St Vivant Grand Cru has a pure bouquet as you would expect, an equal mixture of red and black fruit, but infused with cold stone, wet limestone scents. This is beautifully focused. The palate is very well balanced with superb density, almost Richebourg-like in style, here veering towards dark red fruit -- cranberry, wild strawberry and a touch of brown spice towards the supremely focused and long finish. Sophisticated and precise, this is a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will rivet you to your seat.",,RP 95
657,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Unlike last year, there are three barrels of the 2014 Musigny Grand Cru this year instead of two, not that it is going to make it any easier to find and somehow, I'm not expecting a massive reduction in price. It has a very complex bouquet with dark red fruit, limestone, a hint of hickory and wild hedgerow, quite mercurial in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, silkier than the Clos de Vougeot, harmonious with a killer thread of spice that bursts out towards the finish. Very complex and sophisticated, this Musigny deserves several years in bottle before even thinking about it.",,RP 95
658,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has just a faint reduction on the nose, but behind that lies very intense dark cherry, cranberry jus and mineral scents that seem to gain intensity with every swirl of the glass. The palate is stunning: filigree tannin, almost overwhelming intensity with great power and detail on the silky-smooth finish. This could turn out to be one of the domaine's finest 2014s given this showing, certainly one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest premier crus.",,RP 95
659,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a focused, slightly more introspective bouquet at the moment: dark red fruit, a little briary and cold stone scents. The palate is where it is all happening...filigree tannin, tensile and full of nervosité, unapologetically linear and focused, a Gevrey that demands to be taken seriously with an intense, slightly saline, wonderfully detailed finish that lingers long in the mouth. Superb.",,RP 95
660,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Grand Cru has a backward nose, much more so than the Latricières at the moment, though one can tell that is very well defined and full of tension. The palate is structured right from the entry, arching tannins here, beautifully focused with perfect acidity, gently flowing towards a very poised and tender finish that has so much tension. This is a regal Chambertin.",,RP 95
661,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Boudots 1er Cru has an open, complex nose, here a melange of red and black fruit infused with cold stone, almost flinty scents that impart great focus into this premier cru. The palate is extremely focused, symmetrical, with superb salinity and tension on the finish that lingers for a long time in the mouth. Deep and serious, this is a quite enthralling Nuits-Saint-Georges.",,RP (93-95)
662,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was showing a little more reduction than the other Grand Crus this year, the shopfront closed. The palate is more expressive with supple tannin, a touch of white pepper on the entry, very cohesive but linear for a Clos de la Roche that keeps a tight control on the finish. But the aftertaste is extraordinarily long, leaving the mouth tingling a minute after the wine has departed. One comes away with the impression that this is keeping something up its sleeve after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
663,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes was showing just a little reduction, but behind lies voluminous mulberry and blackcurrant fruit, here edging more towards the dark side of the fruit spectrum. The palate is quite dense, full in the mouth with a gentle grip, some salinity towards the finish, although it is yet to discover is ""flow"" on the finish that at the moment just feels a little static. That will develop once it is in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
664,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny les Fremières 1er Cru has a conservative nose, one that does not want to come out to play at first, although it gradually unfurls in the glass. The palate is very smooth and silky, almost like a Vosne-Romanée, furnished with fine tannin and a keen acidic thread interwoven through what feels like a dense finish. It is linear at the moment, but it will fan out once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
665,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Renardes Grand Cru already has an intriguing bouquet that is forming in barrel, a little more open at the moment with dark berry fruit, a touch of Earl Grey and bay leaf. It is nicely defined, somehow effortless. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, nice and saline in the mouth, very harmonious and silky smooth, so much so that you might think this was Côtes de Nuits. Lovely.",,RP (93-95)
666,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Latricières Chambertin Grand Cru was more open and transparent than the other grand crus this year, with black fruit more than red, a touch of earthiness and a hint of wild mushroom. The palate is quite saline on the entry, typically rather foursquare and correct, the acidity extremely well judged with a controlled -- you could almost say -- conservative finish.",,RP (93-95)
667,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Aux Allots has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath lie some fine, clean and pure black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. There is plenty of energy and animation here, an almost sorbet-like freshness, slightly candied towards the bright and lucid finish. Among Lalou Bize-Leroy's village cru, this might actually be my pick.",,RP (93-95)
668,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is packed full of dark red berry fruit on the nose, just a hint of bay leaf and Earl Grey tea in the background. It is very precise. The palate is fresh and crisp, founded upon edgy tannin, very tensile and brooding especially on the finish that clams up a little, finished in tight-lipped and taciturn fashion.",,RP (93-95)
669,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Aux Genaivrières was a wine that was showing some reduction on the nose, but some rigorous exchange from glass to glass reveals some gorgeous, ebullient raspberry coulis and blueberry scents. The palate is structured and ""solid"" in the mouth, quite dense for a village cru, with plenty of substance on the mulberry and strawberry finish. Give it longer than necessary once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
670,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Vignerondes 1er Cru was a little reduced on the nose, but the palate is very promising with bright red cherry and strawberry fruit, as well as a keen line of acidity. This is a more feminine 2014 with a finessed, beautifully poised finish. Maybe earlier drinking than its peers, yet there is palpable energy here that should see it age for 10 or more years.",,RP (93-95)
671,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru had the unenviable task of following the spellbinding Richebourg and I feel that it does not quite deliver the same degree of complexity and profundity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, just a touch of meatiness on the more savory finish that is long and tender. Fine, if not quite at the level of Lalou's other grand crus this year.",,RP (93-95)
672,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu has a perfumed and quite floral bouquet with pressed rose petal infusing the red berry fruit. It is tight at the moment and will need several years once in bottle. The palate is well balanced, some hardness on the mid-palate, masculine and rigid at the moment, and yet to develop the roundness of this vineyard. But clearly very focused and perhaps a Volnay for the long term.",,RP (93-95)
673,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"When broaching the 2014 Savigny lès Beaune les Narbantons, Lalou quipped that it was her ""Petit Corton."" It has a complex nose of red berry fruit, dried orange peel and even a distant scent of fresh fig. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, plenty of freshness and vitality here, a little hardness toward the finish and a light spicy aftertaste. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
674,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Lavieres has bright raspberry and cranberry fruit on the nose, more stoniness coming through compared to the Aux Allots. The palate is very refined, supple in the mouth, fleshing out nicely towards the finish with hints of brown spice and tart red cherries lining the appealing finish. Just lovely.",,RP (93-95)
675,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Au Bas de Combe, of which there are just two barrels this year, had a  reduced nose when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is lined with darker red fruit than the Lavières, nicely structured, perhaps more masculine, more rustic in style but with plenty of substance. Give it 2-3 years at least after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
676,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2014 Pommard les Vignots has a very elegant bouquet, very pure and self-contained with bright red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and acidity, red cherry and a touch of spice on the structured, slightly brittle finish. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
677,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Romanée-Saint-Vivant 1996 from Domaine Leroy was actually a last minute substitute donated by a generous guest following a string of corked wines. It is an absolutely stunning wine that transfixed everyone before we knew its identity (and here, I must confess that I suggested it was Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.) It's actually better than that. It has a heavenly bouquet  of black cherries, cold limestone and wilted flower petals that you could just sit back and inhale all day. The palate is exquisitely balanced with filigree tannin, extremely pure and refined with astonishing tension and precision from start to finish. It's the vinous equivalent of watching ""Swan Lake.""",,RP (93-95)
678,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a more floral bouquet compared to the Romanee Saint Vivant, at least at the moment. It is very complex: black fruit rather than red, with hints of wilted violet petals and damp moss aromas developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with enormous structure and dimension. It is extremely complex, to the point where I found it difficult to find the right words! It just has a sense of authority and an incredible length that gently grips the mouth and stays there for two minutes after this ineffable wine has departed. Magnificent.",,RP (93-95)
679,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"It seems banal to state that the 2013 Musigny Grand Cru has a very “Musigny” like nose, but that is to say it articulates the terroir extremely well on the nose with black plum and boysenberry fruit, minerals, hints of truffle just in the background. The palate is very refined and pure, lithe, with filigree tannins and persuasive blackberry and bilberry fruit toward the finish inflected with hints of juniper and thyme. This is a Musigny that forces you to pause and reflect.",,RP (93-95)
680,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru has a more expressive bouquet vis-a-vis when I tasted the 2012 last year. Here, one finds touches of maraschino cherries, wild strawberry and undergrowth all beautifully defined, vivacious and ebullient. The palate is supremely focused and symmetrical, the tannin lacy and the texture so silky you might well mistake it for, say, a Romanee Saint Vivant. This is one of the finest Latricieres-Chambertins that I have tasted from Leroy.",,RP (93-95)
681,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant has enthralling transparency and clarity on the nose with perfumed black cherry, bilberry and cold stone scents, perhaps almost like Richebourg in style! The palate is medium-bodied with saturated, silky smooth tannins, luscious red cherry and pomegranate fruit with great purity on the long and tender finish. This is very tempting and sensual. Put a padlock and key on this for several years.",,RP (93-95)
682,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"After the outstanding Latricieres-Chambertin ’13, the 2013 Chambertin appeared sultrier and introspective, difficult to read at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, perhaps more backbone than the Latricieres but at the same time, its seriousness is quite arresting after the flamboyance of its “sister” Grand Cru. It is a Chambertin that does not quite want to get to know you at this absurdly premature juncture and it will require 8-10 years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
683,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de la Roche has an airy and transparent nose that prioritizes the mineral-nature of the vineyard over the fruit at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, lithe in the mouth rather than fleshy, with very good weight, linear, but very harmonious and tender. This is a more understated Clos de la Roche in 2013, nevertheless a beautiful wine that I suspect might drink earlier than the other Grand Crus and yet will last just as long. ",,RP (93-95)
684,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has great clarity on the nose, here veering more toward red fruit than the les Brulées, with subtle wet limestone and granitic scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied, very “gourmand” in the mouth, the kind of wine you don’t know whether to drink or eat (not in terms of texture but the flavors). There is a lovely meaty note that surfaces on the long finish. Tres bon vin!",,RP (93-95)
685,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a very complex bouquet with scents of wet limestone and sea spray infusing the red and black fruit. This is almost pixilated. The palate is quite masculine and linear at the moment, very well defined, impressive structure and presence with a very persistent finish that stays in the mouth a minute after the wine has departed. Divine.",,RP (93-95)
686,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Brulées has a very intense bouquet, a little more floral than I was anticipating, with wilted violets scents chaperoning the black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate is linear and poised, with tensile tannin: strict at first, but that latent concentration fans out gloriously on the tender finish that belies the structure. Sublime.",,RP (93-95)
687,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Hail damage means that there is only a single barrel of the 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu possesses a very elegant wild strawberry and mineral-scented bouquet that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, strawberry pastille and subtle cassis notes towards the suave finish.",,RP (93-95)
688,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Au Bas de Combe veers toward more red fruit than black, compared to the NSG Les Lavieres. The palate is very poised and surfeit with minerality. I detected a little more brightness and verve compared to the Les Lavieres with a prickle of white pepper toward the composed finish.",,RP (93-95)
689,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes seemed more closed, broodier on the nose, compared to the other 2013s from Lalou at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied, fleshy and tender in the mouth, the red fruit moving to black toward the finish furnished with white pepper, rosemary and spice. Quite a mercurial Chambolle, I would afford this at least five or six years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
690,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"There is something slightly more ""confit"" on the nose of the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Les Lavieres compared to the Aux Allot. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine minerality and precision, structured and aloof on the end but extremely well focused. Give this 2 or 3 years after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
691,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Fremieres has a pastille-like purity on the nose adorned with perfumed strawberry and Morello scents, hints of rose petal just behind. The palate is medium-bodied, quite masculine and reserved at first, tertiary/forest floor notes towards the elegant, “classic” Chambolle finish.",,RP (93-95)
692,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges les Vignerondes has a rounded and even at this early stage, generous bouquet with dark plum and mulberry scents, wild hedgerow and a touch of mushroom. The palate is soft on the entry, plenty of ""rondeur"" here with a sensual, caressing dark plum and wild strawberry finish that lingers long in the mouth. This will be very tempting in its youth.",,RP (93-95)
693,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée les Genevrieres has a broody, introspective, sea spray-tinged bouquet that opens beautifully in the glass, but there is something saturnine here, aromatics indifferent to getting to know you. The palate is medium-bodied with a ""confit"" entry, gently grippy tannin structure and an effortless mineral-rich finish, if not quite the length of a top vintage.",,RP (93-95)
694,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is more subdued on the nose compared to Lalou's other '13s, at least on the morning that I tasted it from barrel. It just feels a little conservative. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly angular tannins yet plenty of freshness with a likeable red cherry and cassis-tinged finish that feels silky in the mouth, albeit without the persistence of a great vintage.",,RP (93-95)
695,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"There are just two barrels of the 2013 Savigny-les-Beaunes les Narbantons this year, instead of the usual six. It has a very expressive bouquet with light rose petal and forest-floor notes infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins: crisp acidity and an enthralling brightness toward the finish. This is the kind of Savigny you would slug back with abandon (if you had not seen the producer’s name.)",,RP (93-95)
696,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Aux Allots has a taut, reserved and quite tertiary bouquet that takes time to unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannins, a little savory in the mouth with a harmonious, spicy finish. This constitutes one of Lalou's more approachable earlier-drinking 2013s.",,RP (93-95)
697,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"There was just a little hail damage that affected the 2013 Pommard les Vignots this year. It has a light blackcurrant and briary-scented bouquet that needs a little more vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannins. It feels quite masculine in the mouth, perhaps more austere than the 2012 although the smudge of iodine is welcome.",,RP (93-95)
698,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"No, not the cheapest wine on the planet, but probably worth it. This 1998 Vosne Romanee les Beaux-Monts has a fabulous bouquet with wonderful delineation, hints of bay leaf and rose-petals infusing the mulberry and wild strawberry fruit, developing a fabulous ferrous note with aeration. The palate is fresh and wonderfully poised, the acidity perfectly judged, utterly harmonious with a cashmere texture from start to finish. There is a slight hickory note developing and enhancing the finish that is amazingly detailed, concluding what must be one of the most divine 1998 Côte de Nuits wines at the moment.",,RP (93-95)
699,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the otherworldly 2012 Musigny Grand Cru this year. Despite just a hint of reduction, the intensity on this grand cru is palpable and it unfurls in the moments it has in the glass, revealing dark plum and truffle scents that infuse the black and red fruit. The palate is defies all expectations: perfect acidity, utterly refined tannins, silky texture, a sense of harmony and completeness that it seems to stop the world. To put it candidly, this is a contender for one of the greatest wines that I have ever tasted from barrel…and I have tasted quite a few. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

700,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru was showing more reduction than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant at time of tasting and so I allowed longer for the wine just to try and shake off a little free sulfur. There is wonderful mineralite here – supreme delineation but it is tightly wound, more laconic than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant. The palate is symmetrical, refined and yet intense with life-affirming mineralite on the haunting finish. There is perhaps just a little more persistency than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant, a touch more masculinity also. Wonderful.

701,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru has an entrancing, extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve and wild strawberry intermingling with minerals, cold stone. The palate is so refined and effortless: filigree tannins, perfect acidity allied with a sense of effortlessness contrary to the effort that went into its creation. So silky and weightless on the cashmere finish, this is a wine that you will tell your children about if you are ever blessed to drink a bottle.

702,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"To be honest, the 2012 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has an unenviable job following the transcendental Musigny, but it is still a gorgeous wine, offering incense and blackcurrants infused with minerals on the nose. The palate is structured with a slightly chalky texture, adorned with a lovely sour lemon note that counterbalanced with broody black fruit that builds in the mouth to a very focused, linear finish. Sheer class.

703,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chambertin Grand Cru already boasts a sophisticated bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit, broody at first but opening with a few swirls of the glass. There are hints of maraschino cherry emerging, light touches of mulberry and pomegranate. The palate is medium-bodied with a sterner character than the Latricieres. This is an aristocratic Chambertin in the making, serious and obdurate, underpinned by firm tannins that support the intense, broody black fruit. It has wonderful persistency in the mouth, allied with freshness and race. As epic as Arcade Fire’s “Reflektor”!

It is adorned with a very intense bouquet with dark plum, wild strawberry and forest floor scents, the mineralite emerging with time. The palate has exquisite delineation – it seems to just glide across the mouth, with energetic sorbet-fresh red fruit laced with blood orange and spice, the finish offering hints of cumin and black pepper. This is very complex, intellectual Combottes for long-term aging.

Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

706,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Brulees has stunning mineralite on the nose. You can feel the limestone percolating through the red berry fruit on the nose to devastating effect. Its filigree tannins define the palate and there is a lovely white pepper note lining the entry. It feels long and sensual in the mouth with an intense and yet elegant finish. Complete – but like so many there is a solitary barrel this year.

It has a fragrant, floral bouquet that like so many of Lalou’s 2012s is exquisitely defined and intense, yet never over-powering. The palate is understated, nonchalant even, with perfect acidity and abundant sappy black fruit beautifully interwoven with the oak, segueing into quite a weighty, yet elegant finish.

708,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"There are three pieces of the 2012 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru this year, the solitary white wine from the domaine. It needed two or three minutes to shake off some sulfur. Underneath one can find intense phenolic aromas, pithy pear, nectarine and honeysuckle aromas that are just a little muffled at the moment. The palate is fresh and refined on the entry with apricot and white peach notes, hints of shaved ginger and a light, beautifully balanced finish that seems as fresh as a daisy. Lovely.

709,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots needed a little more coaxing than les Vignerondes, but unfurls to reveal dried petals scents suffusing the red and black fruit profile. The palate is cut from the same cloth as les Vignerondes, but displays a little more matiere and even more precision towards the piercing finish, decorated with hints of wild mushroom towards the long and tender aftertaste. Gorgeous.

710,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru is more open on the nose compared to Lalou’s other grand crus with plenty of rich, generous blackberry and mulberry fruit with hints of wild mushroom just lurking underneath. The palate is lively and precise on the entry. The acidity is very keen here; lending nervosite and freshness, informing the tense citrus-fresh finish that is more like a Vosne-Romanee! This is entrancing and in my opinion it is better than the 2011.

The palate is where it is all happening at this prenatal stage: “killer” tannins, nigh on perfect acidity and a sense of purity that is already quite enthralling.

Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

719,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2012 Pommard Les Vignots has a tightly wound bouquet with briary and blackberry scents. The palate has a firm backbone, with plenty of energy. Black fruit here, brambly, with touches of dark chocolate infusing the energetic finish. This is very fine.

720,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanee-St-Vivant Grand Cru is blessed with a quintessential, floral bouquet that has beguiling complexity. Just allowing it to open over two or three minutes reveals hidden facets: limestone cave, dried herbs, jasmine tea and bay leaf that are all exquisitely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine grip on the entry. There is plenty of concentration here, but it is brilliantly channeled and the finish fans out gloriously on the spice-tinged, animated finish. This is a sensational wine. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

721,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Chambertin Grand Cru demonstrates more complexity and nuance than the Latricieres. The minerality here is immediately evident and the oak seamlessly integrated. The palate is very well-defined with fine tannins, some unresolved oak here to be subsumed, but very focused and intense toward the finish. There is a sense of confidence and brio here that was missing in the Latricieres. What a fabulous wine.

722,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Lavieres has a nose born of the sky more than the earth: airy, lifted and feminine. Touches of cold limestone emerge with time that are entrancing. The palate is vibrant and vital on the entry with a silver thread of acidity, a gradual build in the mouth with shimmering dark cherry and bergamot, then a gentle grip on the tense and teasing Vosne-like finish. Superb.

723,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The rara avis that is the 2011 Musigny Grand Cru has a haunting bouquet that, once again, deserves time to unfurl with blackberry, pomegranate, mineral, cedar and oyster shell notes that are exquisitely defined. The palate is underpinned by filigree tannins. It feels so lithe in the mouth, spicy right from the start that sets the mouth tingling and then a crescendo toward the dark plum and bergamot-tinged finish. This is very complex and simply seamless in the mouth.

It gains intensity in just two or three minutes. The palate is vibrant and quite spicy, almost exotic in terms of richness on the entry, perhaps one of Lalou’s more extravagant 2011s with a scintillating, silky smooth finish that fans across the mouth with hints of raspberry and pomegranate. There is enormous length and intensity present here – a superb Pinot Noir brimming over with vivacity and charm. The parcel of vines within Les Beaux Monts is basically a continuation of Aux Brulees.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins, a denser framework than the RSV with a powerful, almost burly finish, though perhaps the Romanee-Sain-Vivant has a little more finesse and tension.

The palate leans more toward a red fruit profile with succulent ripe tannins; gentle grip and a multi-layered, white pepper-tinged finish that revivifies the senses, leaving it tingling long after the wine has departed.

The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

728,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots is slightly deeper in color compared to the Aux Vignerondes while the bouquet is very different, more marine-influenced, slightly estuarine. The palate is medium-bodied with a heavenly satin-like entry. The acidity is perfectly pitched, this Nuits building in the mouth toward a complete, harmonious, almost Romanee-Saint-Vivant like finish that caresses the mouth and exudes wonderful mineralite. This transcends the vintage. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy.

729,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2011 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes is one of my favorite Premier Crus of the appellations (although Lalou rebuked by suggestion that it can occasionally be a Grand Cru quality!) It has an understated, refined, focused bouquet that builds with aeration: blackberry, a touch of bay leaf, minerals and a distant trace of Provencal herbs. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe tannins and a silky smooth texture; layers of black and red fruit suffused with minerals and just a touch of spice-box toward the long, intense finish. C’mon ... this would embarrass a few Grand Crus Lalou?but maybe from other growers.

730,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2011 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a sedate, refined bouquet or raspberry preserve, wild strawberry and a touch of wild hedgerow – airy and lifted. The palate is silky smooth on the entry. It is very harmonious and feminine with a succulent, sweet red currant and strawberry finish with just a tincture of vanilla. This is gorgeous and very seductive.

731,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"There is just one barrel of the 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Bas de Combe that has the most straight-laced bouquet of the three Nuits-St-Georges 2011s: a little rounded on the nose with hints of mulberry infusing the black fruit. The palate is the most structured, the tannins forming a fine chassis for the pure black cherry, dark plum and spicy fruit, a clever dash of white pepper sprinkled over the finish when nobody was looking. Superb.

732,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2011 Nuits St.Georges Les Allots has a striking bouquet, more immediate than the Pommard with lifted mineralite, beautifully defined and focused. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, waves of black currant and raspberry fruit underlined by superb tension and poise. Everything is reined in toward the finish that is very composed with a long aftertaste and spicy coda. Excllent.

733,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2011 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots-les-Milieu comes from a parcel that Lalou’s family had been buying since 1949. It has an extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve, wild strawberry, cold stone and cheeky touch of marmalade. The palate is structured on the entry: a little more masculine than her other crus with a tightly wound finish. A little more closed than say, Dominique Lafon’s 2011, encountered the previous day, and probably deserving two or three years in bottle.

The palate is rounded and lithe in the mouth, the oak a little more pronounced at the moment although that will be subsumed with the passing of time. There is a gradual build toward a complete, caressing black cherry and black olive finish, a spicy note on the aftertaste so that you do not forget it in a hurry.

The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy, almost corpulent entry. It has very fine volume in the mouth, fanning out on the broad dark plum and mulberry infused finish.

There is lovely length here. The finish is understated, leaving just a touch of soy lingering at the back of the mouth.

So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

737,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Latricieees-Chambertin Grand Cru showed a little reduction on the nose, although rigorous swirling remedied that. It offers a broody bouquet with dark fruit: blackberry and Dorset plum, but it will offer more in the future. The palate is medium-bodied with an attractive chewy entry, a nice grip and a long succulent finish. This is a fine 2011 but for me, not quite at the ethereal level of Lalou Bize-Leroy’s other Grand Crus.

738,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2011 Pommard Les Vignots was bottled December 2012. It has a complex, slightly earthy bouquet with subtle marine influences, defined and focused with hints of black olive emerging with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with fine focus, imbued with an Oriental edge (hoisin) which is folded into a fine silky finish. Drink now-2020.

739,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee Les Genaivrieres, which lies in close proximity to Lalou’s maison in Vosne, shows a touch of reduction on the nose with primal red rather than black fruit. It comes across as a little conservative after the wonderful Nuits 2011s. The palate is silky smooth on the entry, very refined with supple, lithe tannins. There are plenty of pure dark cherry and raspberry preserve notes to enjoy with a sedate, comfy finish that has a lovely caressing texture.

740,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"This is the third time that I have tasted the Corton-Charlemagne from Lalou-Bize Leroy. Here, the nose is a little more reticent than the last bottle in early 2012, but it opens immediately to reveal that rich, almost honeyed aroma, though here I notice a slight kerosene-like tincture. The palate is medium-bodied, powerful and very well-balanced with that core of spicy, honeyed fruit and a touch of glycerin on the weight finish. It is a sensual Corton-Charlemagne, but as I have commented before, it does not express the terroir with the clarity of others Leroy wines that I have tasted. Tasted May 2013.",,RP (94-96)
741,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the clear highlights of the vintage, the 2010 Musigny is simply magnificent. It possesses stunning depth and richness in all directions, with seemingly endless nuances that open up in the glass. A spherical, totally stratospheric wine, the Musigny is deeply resonant yet weightless. It is a standout in this flight of grand crus from Lalou Bize-Leroy. This is the purest essence of Musigny. Anticipated maturity: 2025-2045.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable. There is no more ardent exponent of the most fundamental of all Burgundian values – the concept of terroir – than Lalou Bize-Leroy.

Today the Brulees is much more open than it was a few months ago, but its potential is the same, which is to say, the wine is simply magnificent. In 2010, the Brulees is pure seduction. Rich, dense, yet light on its feet, the Brulees is marvelously complex, but in the end, it is the sheer texture of the wine that delights the intellectual and hedonistic senses most of all. The seductive, ethereal finish leaves a lasting impression. Tasted next to Beaux Monts, which this parcel is adjacent to, the Brulees is intensely floral and precise, with more of a dark red fruit profile.

Dark red berries, smoke and licorice are all woven into the eternal, saline-infused, textured finish. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2030.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable. There is no more ardent exponent of the most fundamental of all Burgundian values – the concept of terroir – than Lalou Bize-Leroy.

752,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2010 Pommard Vignots wraps around the palate with serious depth and structure. This is an especially dark, brooding Vignots that needs time in the glass to start opening up. Hints of tar, smoke and incense wrap around the deep, resonant finish. From barrel, the wine’s structural components were more dominant, but now that the wine is in bottle, the sheer depth of the fruit is much more evident. The Vignots is even more impressive from bottle than it was from barrel, and that is saying a lot. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.

Because of the minuscule yields of the year, in 2010 Bas de Combe, Aux Allots and Lavieres were blended into a single Nuits bottling. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2030.

Waves of sumptuous dark fruit saturate the palate in this decidedly ripe, flashy Burgundy. Today, the Santenots is a bit oaky, while the style is on the edge of being over the top, neither of which was evident from barrel. The 2010 will appeal most to readers who like big, dramatic Burgundies. It is the only 2010 here (and at D’Auvenay) that came in at the lower end of my barrel scores.

This is a knock out set of wines from Lalou Bize-Leroy. Cold weather during the flowering reduced her already minuscule yields even further. As in many domaines, the most dramatic proof of the low yields was in the skimpy number of barrels to be seen in the cellars. There are a number of totally transcendental wines in this lineup. As always the wines were made with 100% stems and aged in 100% new barrels. The 2010s are notable for so many reasons, most importantly of all, though, they provide a window to the essential qualities of many of Burgundy’s top sights as seen through the lens of one of the region’s most brilliant and inspired vigneronnes.

This isn’t an immediate wine, rather it is a Burgundy that challenges all of the senses with sublime understated personality. Time spent with the wine is immensely rewarding, as the Chambertin is constantly changing in the glass, challenging the taster to keep up with its sheer pedigree. This is all nuance and class. I also tasted the 2010 from barrel, and it was beyond profound. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.  

This was my first opportunity to taste the 2009s from Domaine Leroy in bottle.

Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top? If that wine is representative of the year, Leroy fans will have another superb vintage to look forward to, although yields will be lower than the already minuscule production.

773,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2009 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres is rich, seductive and incredibly primary, with little in the way of aromatic expressiveness. This is the first wine of these 2009s that is closed in on itself. With time in the glass hints of red cherries and flowers begin to emerge, yet this remains an implosive wine in need of considerable cellaring. The depth of the fruit and the elegance of the tannins are impossible to miss, but this multi-dimensional wine begs for patience. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2034.

780,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The classic scents of rose petal and licorice, allied to game, cassis, and dark cherry along with ethereal, penetrating distilled herbs and berries make for a heady aromatic display in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Chambertin, then exhibit themselves on a palate that combines richness and vivacity, textural allure with firm underlying structure, and above all density with uncanny levity. The incursion of salted red meat juices lends another layer of complexity while tugging relentlessly at your salivary glands, whereas fruit pit piquancy and chalky minerality in no way deflect the purity of this Chambertin’s inexorable fountain of fruit. This is one of those instances were a wine is so arresting it takes control of you. I felt enervated and afterward exhausted. For the few lucky enough to acquire three bottles of this, perhaps one per decade would be the proper measure. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates.

781,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The remarkably maritime mingling of salt spray, alkali, kelp, iodine, and crustacean present in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Romanee-St.-Vivant could, I think, only have come from this amazing site. Bright red raspberry and pungent ginger and black pepper, add to the invigorating and enticingly savory salinity on a buoyant palate at once subtly creamy and bright. Ocean meets forest as brooding, decadent notes of underbrush and other woodsy organic remains emerge; while musky narcissus and bitter-sweet gentian add enchanting inner-mouth perfume. All the while, there is a keenly kinetic interaction of all these elements. The finishing sense of shrimp and lobster shell reduction allied to persistently bright, downright refreshing red fruits is as uncanny as it is irresistibly coercive of the next sip. And if this wine doesn’t leave you salivating helplessly, I suspect you have glandular medical issues. My Leroy vintage tasting had reached a point where I was caught between the anticipation of those inevitably great wines that lay ahead, and a desire to simply cancel the rest of my work day and spend it sipping and contemplating this Romanee-St.-Vivant. But I still had inter alia eight Leroy grand crus to go – which signals something interesting. Madame Bize-Leroy served this ahead of all her grand crus save the Corton, perhaps because this is ultimately more delicate. It’s also less dark in color than its siblings. This should offer profound and dazzling complexity for 25 or 30 years provided you can uphold your end of the deal.

782,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"If I was expecting density and formidable tanninity from Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Clos Vougeot – and I guess that, relatively speaking, I was – it surprised me with its remarkable sense of buoyancy and transparency. The extract and the tannic underpinnings are there, but felt in the background – or like the ground you walk on and whose support you don’t think about. Through a deep pool of grenadine, cherry and red meat juices are glimpsed heliotrope and narcissus perfume; rose hip, black tea and licorice; salt and crushed stone. An invigoratingly tart kick of berry skin and rhubarb adds to the kinetic intensity of an exhilarating finish. In 25 years I suspect this will still have sap and energy in reserve. It is a Clos Vougeot like no other I can recall.

783,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, jasmine, peat, charred red meat, and fresh dark berries scent and saturate the firm but expansive palate of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Latricieres Chambertin. Much of the same “blood of the stones” sense of mineral saturation emerges here as on the corresponding 2007, but this wine’s dark family of flavors is allied to almost blazing brightness of fresh fruit acidity in a manner that – along with its underlying firmness – calls to mind 2005. What’s more, for all of this wine’s full-court-press of flavor, dark depth, and bedrock-firm structure, it reveals an uncanny sense of sheer levity that presages future elegance. My palate just can’t shake loose its array of flavors. I’m guessing that 25 years from now this great wine and its 2005 counterpart will still seem like remarkable twins separated at birth. (Please don’t imagine them in a ring together, though, duking it out to determine a winner.)

784,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Hints of game and animal fur as well as musky perfume of peony and narcissus all contribute funk to the aromatic complexity of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Aux Brulees, whose sweet side is represented by ripe black fruits, garlanded in heliotrope and fading lily. A marine alliance of alkalinity and mouthwateringly salinity joins peat, chalk, black tea, and forest underbrush and detritus on a silken, strikingly buoyant palate that really takes one on a tour of the dark, decadent mansion of Vosne-Romanee. This finishes darkly, deeply, envelopingly – and yet, the vivacious impingement of fresh berries, piquancy of tea and fruit pit, and invigorating pungency of mineral salts offer quickening 2008 typicity as well as a striking sense of counterpoint. This fits the Burgundian saying about Pinot offering a glass of night before you go into your own long night, and I hope to meet this sinisterly profound Vosne once more before The Reaper calls me. This wine harbors 20-25 years of vigor. (About myself, I’m a little less sure.)

785,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2008 Musigny is firm in texture and initially relatively reticent in aroma. Roasted red meat richness and decadently game-like elements put me a bit in mind of what I had expected from the corresponding Vougeot, but a blooming profusion of musky floral perfume bespeaks Musigny. There is a subtle oiliness of texture coating the tannins here and a tiny-berry concentration of diverse red fruits is shadowed by their ethereal distilled counterparts as well as by Chartreuse-like high-toned herbal evocations. This Musigny’s sheer sappy concentration, formidable structure, and carnal depth preclude its being charming or seductive in the unforgettable manner of its 2007 predecessor. But that doesn’t mean the finish here isn’t spellbinding or that the wine won’t bewitch you. Here, I suspect, is another candidate for a quarter-century’s enthralling evolution.

Site-typical carnal elements in the nose are especially clean rather than gamy, and allied to suggestions of red fruit distillates, ocean spray, and forest floor. An infectiously mouthwatering savor of tiny red fruits (lingonberry, red currant, fraise du bois); red filet-mignon juices; rich beef marrow; mineral salts; leather; and brown spices floods and invigorates the texturally seamless, incipiently satiny palate in a show of palpable density and gripping persistence that somehow also leaves room for tenderness. Tea like smokiness and tannin that suffuse this Savigny similarly do not preclude a vintage-typical sense of vivacity. A vibratory, kaleidoscopic finish caps this thrilling effort that ought to be worth following for a quarter century.

The invigorating, saliva-inducing salinity here mounts along with the fruit intensity on a trumpet-like finish. It’s easy at this address to become inured to complexity, but I think it’s fair to say that this Richebourg does not quite reach the level in that department of the very finest Leroy 2008s. Perhaps that will come. What is amazing for now is above all this wine’s clarion intensity and sheer palate persistence. It should be given at least 8-10 years in cellar with the confidence that it will thereafter perform brilliantly for at least an equal interval.

788,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"After the amazing performance of its 2007 predecessor, I was especially keen to see what the Leroy 2008 Clos De La Roche held in store, especially given the energetic proclivities of its vintage. Cedar, quarry dust, and aromas of clean raw red meat ally themselves with intensely ripe cherry and black raspberry, which acquire a liqueur-like richness on a palate whose texture is as seamless as is the uncanny welding of distilled and confitured fruits, chalk and subtly oaky elements it manages to achieve. Here’s an instance, though, where 2007 beats 2008 at its own high-energy game. Still, this hauntingly-long 2008 is remarkable in its way, and doubtless poised to reveal further complexity to accompany its amazing richness over the next two decades.

This manages to be palpably extract-rich yet buoyant, tannic yet polished and inextinguishably juicy.

791,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Dark cherry and cassis infused with juniper berry, chalk dust, and decomposing wood provocatively scent the Leroy 2008 Corton Renardes, the addition of cherry pit bitterness on its silken palate pulling it in an almost austere direction from which the essential primary fruit juiciness so typical for the best of this vintage pulls it back. Beneath the layer of satin one senses a fine-grained structure as formidable as are this wine’s sense of somehow tasteable chalky mother rock and the vino-electric power dammed up behind it. This is a model of rectitude and its finish of pure, unwavering penetration. It’s also more latent than actualized. To follow its evolution over the next 20 or more years would be thrilling.

This gripping, energetic Pinot is far from the subtlest or most refined of Leroy 2008s, but its impressive virtues should merit following for the better part of two decades. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates. (Please note that my account of the complete 2007 red collection at Leroy was published in issue #189.)

793,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The Leroy 2008 Vosne-Romanee Aux Genaivrieres displays exhilarating vivacity; compulsively saliva-inducing salinity; and profound marrow-like richness. Toasted almond, cherry pit, vanilla, and marzipan add allure, and somehow even the confectionary notes here are integrated harmoniously and harnessed to the wines mineral and meat message and its matrix of fresh red fruits. Intriguing, Vosne-typical forest floor shadings emerge on the long, mouthwatering, buoyant, and invigorating finish.

794,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"There are hints of game and even a whiff of manure on the nose of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts in a manner for which other wines in this collection will already have prepared you, here accompanied by smoky black tea and peat, along with ripe black fruits that come to the palate piquantly as well as tartly invigorating. Neither the mysterious low tones and minerality nor the vivacity of the corresponding Brulees are present here, but there is an almost implosive, sap-like sense of tiny-berry concentration mingled with resin and meat stock reduction that you simply can’t get off of your palate. I suspect that we’re dealing here with a late-bloomer and would wait to revisit this for at least half a dozen years, figuring that it will be well worth following for at least 15-20.

795,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Leroy’s 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes offers complex scents and flavors of smoky black tea, humus, and plum pit, along with ripe, fleshy, faintly tart-edged dark cherry and purple plum. Polished in texture and generously rich, this comes to a long but surprisingly sedate conclusion, both soothing and stimulating, although not exhilarating in the manner of the finest wines in this collection. Taken by itself, though, rather than in comparison, this is impressively refined and complex Pinot. Perhaps time will bring greater eloquence. I cannot imagine this rewarding fewer than a dozen years of repeat visits.

796,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The Leroy 2008 Pommard Les Vignots displays a vivacity throughout that is quite vintage-typical but in my experience rare at this address. Smoked meat and rich marrow lend a strikingly carnal cast. Cherry pit and marine minerality lead to a dynamic finishing interchange of invigorating bitterness and salinity against a refined, transparent, and downright refreshing layering of red berry and meat. This ought to be worth following for at least the next dozen years.

797,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Sweetly ripe cherry and raspberry in Leroy’s 2008 Volnay Santenots du Milieu, are overlain with sweet, smoky, machine oil-like pungency as well as decadently floral and faintly fecal notes that suggest brettanomyces, and will render this wine controversial. A bright burst of vintage-typical fresh red raspberry and cherry juiciness emerges at mid-palate, where an uncanny balance of incipient creaminess and brightness is also suggested, but there is a very slight tendency toward dryness in an otherwise pungently-persistent and sweetly-ripe finish. Having a chance to taste these wines but once, I shall only voice as a suspicion that this is one Leroy Pinot liable to stray from the straight and narrow.

798,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Musigny presents in many respects a more profound and concentrated variation on her superb Chambolle Charmes of the vintage. Its tear-jerking brightness of cherry and raspberry fruit and their distilled essences, decadent florality, and saliva-inducing maritime depth are extraordinary. The carnality here is akin to foie gras and the umami-rich crustacean aspect akin to sea urchin roe and lobster shell reduction. Hints of blond tobacco, peat, iris, fruit pit, and a hit of caramel add further, bittersweet nuance to an already multidimensional experience. Richly and tenderly-fruited and –textured, yet vivacious and penetrating, this should continue to perform astonishingly over the next two decades if not beyond. 

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

799,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, rose petal, and dark cherry in the site-typical nose of Leroy’s 2007 Chambertin lead to a sumptuous, silken, sweetly-fruited palate that for all of its richness displays lift and elegance, and for all of its sucrosity harbors irresistible saline and carnal savor, rendering a saliva-inducing, tongue-titillating finish. As with the corresponding Clos Vougeot, it’s almost hopeless to try to dissect this further with flailing descriptors. Suffice it to say that yes, it is regal and suggests that a benign monarch might make for the best form of red Burgundy, a hypothesis that I suspect will withstand two decades or more of testing.

800,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Kirsch, rose hip, and soy intensely scent the Leroy 2007 Clos De La Roche, which reveals brightness and finesse as well as a saline savor unusual for its appellation. To be sure, notes of leather and crushed stone as well as smoked and roasted meats contribute further and perhaps more site-typical complexity. But it’s the sheer finesse, buoyancy, and vibratory energy on display that most amaze, leaving your tongue and gums a quiver and your salivary glands pumping helplessly. There is also a faint hint of heat, but its effect is negligible given what’s going on around you when you swallow (or, in my case, spit). Look for 20 or more years of excitement.

Dark berries and dark, mossy, humus-rich forest floor; saline, crustacean-reduction, and oyster flesh mineral-animal savor; sweetly ripe raspberry, all follow from the nose across a sumptuously rich palate, and into a prodigious, saliva-inducing finish.

802,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Clos Vougeot issues from three parcels at different elevations of the clos, and the belief (in which she is hardly alone) that such a range of parcels better expresses the essence of this cru is lent credibility in the glass. Ripe plum, cherry and their pits; roasted meats; salt and crushed stone are all prominent in a Pinot of formidable aromatic and gustatory intensity; abundant but refined tannin; and a reverberative finish that rings changes on your palate. The depth of rich meatiness; succulence of dark fruits; and formidable minerality are difficult to break down into further descriptive details, but taking a sip of this is like turning your palate and imagination over to auto-pilot, and if you cellar some, I suspect it will still be capable of holding you hostage and challenging the prowess of its 2005 counterpart two decades from now.

804,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2006 Latricieres Chambertin smells of peat, soy, game, and bloody meat juices, which figure on a palate of compressed intensity. Talk about “blood of the stones” – this seems to epitomize that phrase, although some of the iron-rich, corpuscular, animal variety is flowing through its veins as well. The presence of tart red berry concentrate seems almost incidental in the present context. A sort of sepulchral depth and stony fundament lend this severely palate-staining Pinot an aura of mystery. But it isn’t a charmer, and in its present state one imagines a vampire would find it more enticing than would a normal pinotphile. The sense of awed anticipation – of what this might become in 10-20 years – is its greatest attraction, in which respect, too, it is singular among 2007s.

There is a meaty savor, smoky tang, and brightness of berry fruit that truly stains the palate. I expect this is another Leroy wine that will defy its vintage by retaining stamina for two or more decades, and in the process will almost certainly reveal further facets.

808,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Smoky, gamey, and crushed stone scents on the nose of Leroy’s 2007 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons segue into a palate of remarkable depth and grip, featuring peat, chalk, humus, roasted meats, toasted nuts, musk, and sea water. This is one of those red Burgundies that prompts you to wonder how such flavors could come from grapes, but that at the same time seems uncannily at home mingling with saliva in human mouths. It also perfectly exemplifies the iron-first-in-velvet-glove metaphor with a chain mail-like sense of fine-grained resilience that in no way detracts from textural allure. Bize-Leroy compares this (like several in Savigny) under-rated site with Corton, and the analogy is especially apt in such an instance of grand cru aspirations fulfilled. I would anticipate at least the better part of two decades’ fascination.

This is as tenderly-fruited, finesseful, buoyant, and downright refreshing a Pinot as I can imagine issuing from Nuits-St.-Georges, even if it lacks the sort of profound richness that more often characterizes the best wines from this domaine. I suspect it will remain well worth re-visiting for a dozen or more years, but (on the counterfactual assumption that I could both locate and afford some of this) I would not want to miss out on experiencing its youthful charms as well.

Expansive and overtly ripely fruited, yet firm, and more restrained in the finish than its aromas and initial palate impression led me to expect, here is a Vosne whose deep layers can almost certainly be mined only over a period of 10-15 years.

Smoky, faintly bitter black tea is emphasized along with leather in a finish satisfyingly persistent if not refined or polished.

The opaque sense of richness here is at odds with the norm among Leroy 2007s and is literally reflected in the glass by the wine’s turbidity. For now, the finishing fruit has to work hard to overcome gum- and lip-numbing tannin of a sort that I do not think is merely being temporarily accentuated and that I am not convinced – Leroy’s obvious belief to the contrary notwithstanding – conduces to long-term cellaring. That said, I would, of course, be delighted if she and this wine – neither of which I challenge lightly – made me look foolish a dozen years hence.

820,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Initially a bit reduced, the Leroy 2006 Musigny responded to a shaking, blossoming into a wealth of floral perfumes, ripe fresh red fruits, citrus oils, and marine breeze. Strikingly vivacious and buoyant on the palate as well as silken in texture, this at the same time reveals a deeply meaty and stony undertone. The finish dynamically weaves its berry-intense, carnal, mineral, and floral strands into a long, colorful braid. And in the empty glass you realize that the spell of reduction is now completely broken and an eruption of floral perfume and of spirituous as well as fresh red fruit essences ensues. This is another great 2006 representative of its site in the making, as well as another demonstration of how beautifully suited the vintage is to expressing this site's virtues and vice-versa. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest.

821,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy's 2006 Romanee-St.-Vivant Leroy smells alluringly of fresh strawberry and cherry along with their spirituous stand-ins. Suggestions of quince and honey along with lily perfume give the aromas an exotically, almost white wine dimension. On the palate this is liquid floral perfume and silk along with the essence of red fruits and hints of nut oils. But the dark, decadent suggestions of humus, peat, game, and otherwise ineffable mineral notes one anticipates from the best exemplars of the site are hauntingly present as well. This epitomizes the refinement and buoyancy of which its vintage is capable, finishing with cycloramic scope and symphonic length. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest.

822,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The Leroy 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes smells mouth-wateringly of fresh fraise du bois, kirsch, lilies, and a whiff of wood smoke. Tiny-berried concentration of red fruits; a tender, silken texture; and a sensation of lift and wafting delicacy put this in a category of its own, much as the 2005 rendition distinguished itself by being far and away the most refreshing and precisely-delineated in flavors of its collection. There is a shimmering interchange of fruit, flowers, and subtly saline mineral and carnal savor here that will keep you transfixed, your tongue trembling, and your salivary glands out of control. Here is a wine that epitomizes the classic conception of Chambolle as a wine of elegance and finesse, as well as epitomizing the potential of the 2006 vintage.

823,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Haunting rose petal, anise, and ripe cherry in the nose of Bize-Leroy's 2006 Chambertin signal a classic of its appellation, and the texturally-caressing, mouth-coating impression that follows tells you that this will be singularly 2006 in its tenderness and youthful approachability. Like the corresponding Latricieres, you have to look hard to find this Chambertin's abundance of fine tannin, as the flavors seem almost to hover over the palate, and its long finish practically dissolves into sheer inner-mouth perfume. The suggestions of carnal and mineral nuance here are extremely subtle – though almost sure to grow with time – and it is the wine's remarkably ethereal yet intense presence of sweetness and perfume that render it already unforgettable.

824,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Roasted meat and quarry dust mingle with ripe, lightly-cooked strawberry and cherry in the nose of the Leroy 2006 Clos De La Roche. Creamy, gently soothing, and generously broad and sweetly-fruited in a manner one doesn't anticipate from its site, this Pinot's mineral and animal dimensions only strongly reassert themselves in the long, strikingly buoyant finish, along with black tea, distilled essences of red berries, and peat. This is one of many wines of its collection almost certain to gain in nuance and allure with a few years in bottle, although it is frankly irresistible now.

825,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Given the many extraordinary examples of Corton in this vintage, I was inevitably full of anticipation in approaching the Leroy 2006 Corton Renardes, and it did not disappoint. Ripe purple plum and quarry dust scent the nose. On the palate, the rich fruit here seems to oscillate in counterpoint with mineral nuances for a vibratory expression of vinous energy and complexity, and while the texture is velvet-like there is both a sense of primary juiciness and of lift that make for elegance, refreshment, and youthful accessibility one wouldn't ordinarily encounter in great Corton. The underlying structure is present for long aging, to be sure, but is almost undetectably woven into the wine's fabric. As this opened to the air, animal notes added to the intriguing mineral dimensions, and finish really took flight.

826,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Smoky pungency mingles with dark berry concentrates and bitter-sweet floral essences on the nose of the Leroy 2006 Richebourg. This Pinot strides magisterially onto the palate, with obvious firmness and depth of tannic tread, but at the same time a plush wealth of sweet black fruits that overrides the tannins and makes for a surprisingly soothing impression. Crushed stone and roasted meats add authority to a long finish in which rather obvious tannins returned. Somehow, the character of the vintage seems to suit the Romanee-St.-Vivant better than it does this Richebourg. But it's early days, especially for a wine of such sweetness of fruit, muscularity, and sheer extract as this. Furthermore, it's hard for me to discount the possibility that the unexpected and slightly awkward reappearance of tannins in the finish here might be a function of temporary perturbation or Burgundian Pinot moodiness.

This is truly like liquid silk, yet refreshing at the same time; intensely fruited (seemingly supported by a couple of grams of residual sugar) yet with plenty of Chambolle-typical carnality and minerality. Those few wine lovers able to afford and acquire it ought not to delay in enjoying at least a portion of their treasure.

Smoky, saline, and pungently herbal notes mingle with the carnal and berry-rich elements in a long finish of mouth-watering savor and invigoratingly pungent smokiness.

Rich and velvety on the palate, this favors the soothing rather than invigorating or refreshing side of 2006, with a metaphorically dark, decadent complexity that puts me more in mind of Romanee St.-Vivant than it does of Richebourg, very near to which this wine grew.

This is a perfect example of a 2006 one would not want to miss out on enjoying young, even though it will almost surely possess considerable aging potential. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest. Despite their winsomeness, they have long life expectancies. Since, however, I have very little experience of their predecessors as they have matured, I have confined my prognostication to a few isolated and very general comments in the tasting notes that follow. Note that I have included as well under the heading ""Leroy"" the wines of Madame Bize-Leroy's Domaine d'Auvenay – its cellars located outside Saint-Romain – which now encompass two appellations in red, since inevitably when information is being sought about these wines, and even often when they are described, it is under the name ""Leroy.""

836,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"A site-typically smoky, ""ferrous"" pungency along with ripe dark cherry fruit rises from the glass of Leroy 2006 Pommard Les Vignots, which then comes to the palate subtly meat broth-like; persistently mineral; and brimming with juicy and ingratiating ripe fruit. This is one of those select Pommards of the vintage that has real spring in its step and elegant tannic attire.

In terms of fruit freshness, though, this is bright, while also displaying a hint of tannic grit. Its lingering finish returns to the dark side, with intriguing intimations of future complexity, though only time, I think, will reveal how this wine's tannins are resolved.

838,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Smoked meat and fresh dark cherry in the nose of Leroy's 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes lead to a broad, sweetly-fruited palate enhanced by savory carnality and salinity. Compared with most of the wines here today, this lacks a bit of finishing refinement and lift, and there is a faint gum numbness after the fruit has faded. That said, we are still in the realm of concentration, sumptuousness, and healthy ripeness – indeed, near over-ripeness – that cannot help but impress.

839,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"I had to draw a deep breath in anticipation of what would rise from my glass of Leroy 2005 Musigny, and in that moment Madame Leroy trenchantly observed that “it’s another world” down in there. Tea, ginger, tangerine rind, myriad sweet flowers, cherry distillate, truffles, and fraise des bois preserves are among the scents that pour forth. Bloody fresh meat and implacable chalk join the medley of fruit, floral and spice concentrates on a palate whose texture “polish,” “refinement,” or “velvet” are pitifully inadequate to describe. For all of its amazing richness, this displays more of a confident inner sweetness than a superficial sucrosity, and there is no lack of sheer energetic brightness of fruit and drive. Indeed, seatbelts would be advised before attempting to swallow this elixir, such is the phenomenal thrust of its finish.

840,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Chambertin (like her Musigny and Clos Vougeot, from three parcels) leads with a knockout punch of super-concentrated, liqueur-like black raspberry, cassis, and licorce, rose petal (no, make that the whole rose garden!), and deep, roasted meatiness. Monumentally dense, yet vibrant and energetic, this builds momentum on the palate as it adds black pepper, tactile cinnamon spice, and distilled fruit and herb concentration. I have seldom experienced such a literal (not to mention phenomenally long) finish: it simply wiped the floor with your humble critic. If I were ever to encounter this wine in the ring again, I pray that it won’t be for at least a decade (and that it spots me 98 points).

841,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Romanee-St.-Vivant is improbably dark and deep in color even by her standards, and darkness and depth characterize its personality as well. Clove, cumin, cocoa powder, lily, and black pepper complement a nose of distinctly liqueur-like black fruits. In the mouth, this is liquid velvet. Chocolate-covered black cherries, plum preserves, and truffles are laced with creme de cassis and soy, underlain by a decidedly stony, chalky minerality and a fine but firm web of tannin. By now one realizes that 2005 is an exceptional vintage for this site in and of itself, but one would never confuse the D.R.C. or Potel renditions with this flamboyant, extravagantly-rich version from Leroy.

842,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"A dizzying and seductive bouquet incorporating licorice, spice cake, cherry preserves, and humus announces the arrival of a 2005 Latricieres-Chambertin that takes the smooth, silken-creamy texture of so many of these Leroy 2005s to a new level. Interestingly, this is a bit less deep in color than the rest of today’s grand cru company, and is visibly unfiltered. Explosively intense yet clear as a bell in its finish of licorice and cherry, and with ferocious animal intensity and a veritable smelting of ore-like minerals (could these be Latriciere’s notorious iron asserting itself?), this marks the point at which true geeks will get out their stopwatches and start timing. It comes off as almost spare in the context of Leroy other 2005s, and it won’t be everyone’s cup of Pinot, but I would dearly love to revisit it in 8-10 years.

843,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The parcel that informs a 2005 Clos de la Roche touches Leroy’s Combottes. This wine smells of resin, tobacco, incense, roasted meats, wood smoke, wet stones, alongside stewed cherries and rhubarb. Roasted and stewy richness characterize the intimate meld of meat and fruit on the palate as well. For sheer density this is incredibly impressive, but it’s not at all lacking in the kinetic department, either. What is lacking is the perfume or pure clarity of fruit that the best of this collection display. Almost frighteningly gripping in the back (or on the way down, should you dare to swallow!) with an implosive display of meatiness and stony minerality, this will surely need years to reveal its full potential.

844,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Their 2005 Richebourg leads with black raspberry liqueur, crystalized ginger, coconut, and candied violets. In the mouth, a meaty element, enhanced spiciness and a tart yet stewy rhubarb note emerge. To state that the overall impression is fat, full and creamy seems unnecessarily repetitive. But there is much more obvious tannin and new wood (even though it is the same 100%) in evidence than with the wines that proceeded it, and perhaps partly in consequence the formidably long finish is dominated by roasted meats with a sort of dry-rubbed spiciness, the suggestions of fruit more spiritous than fleshy. Still, the sheer intensity displayed is itself remarkable. This would be an amazing wine to revisit, but probably not inside a decade.

Yet for all of this sweetness in the nose, the wine comes to the palate refreshingly free of superficial sucrosity. Cherry pit bitterness and bright, ripe fruit acids, plus scintillating inner-mouth florality contribute to an impression of great precision and “cut” (the last word I would have used in describing any of the preceding Leroy 2005s) and the taster is carried away on a wafting wealth of finishing fruit, flowers, spice, marrow and chalk essence-of-Chambolle.

This is silky in texture but bright and insistent in its sense of primary fresh fruit. A superbly long finish unites cherry liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla, chalk dust, and a savory meatiness, and the empty glass is sweetly perfumed with sensational intensity. I have never tasted a youthful Corton remotely so forward, perfumed, silken, or superficially sweet.

Polished and suave on the palate, with pure, sweet black cherry and raspberry fruit in both liqueur-like and fresh forms (as with so many of the wines in this collection), it also displays deep meat and mushroom stock and a singed, caramelized edge to the fruit. This epitomizes the concept “layered,” but on the other hand, it leaves no nooks or crannies for warts or quirky complexities to inhabit because it’s seamless.

Smoky, meaty aromas and a chalky density, smoky, salty meatiness along with black-fruited intensity on the palate are certainly in character for this appellation. This has girth and grip, a monumental structure and layering of meat, fruit, and mineral that lead one to anticipate formidable but glacial aging. There is not a lot of charm, no flattering high-toned perfume ... no, there is “just” a seamless meld of materials with massive yet superbly well-integrated tannic structure.

In the mouth, this exhibits real girth and grip, yet for all of the enveloping aspect of the fruit, there is plenty of bright freshness as well to carry into a finish with low-toned, up-welling of meat and minerals. This Nuits displays amazing richness, energy, and sheer intensity not to mention clarity of fruit.

Voluminous and luminous in the mouth, this exhibits a continuation of the Leroy alliance of liqueur-like and fresh fruit aspects, amazingly precocious and beguiling creaminess of texture, and deep meatiness, buried truffles, and soy-like savor. It may miss the mystery of a few of its predecessors, but like Leroy’s Santenots, this Beaux Monts is compellingly sweet, rich, seamless and pure. There is a sultry sense about it, but no real heat in the finish.

But while the liqueur-like expression of fruit persists throughout, a fresh, juicy invigorating fruit character comes to its aid to prevent the wine’s becoming cloying. This Pinot displays in spades the proclivity of some of the best 2005s to combine the maximum concentration and richness of fruit compatible with refreshing juiciness and elegance. The amazingly pure, luscious finish – tinged with vanilla and nutmeg notes from the barrel – goes on and on. I suppose there could (and may well with time) be more complexity here, but the purity of fruit, uncanny balance and sheer length are enough to wow me.

Lovely dark berries, black truffles, moss, subtle muskiness and animality mark its very ‘05 and very noir palate, like an expansive, magic forest of flavors. The wine finishes with remarkable refinement and delicacy of plum and cherry fruit and a continuation of myriad mysterious fungal, scrub and animal shadings. Flatteringly creamy, it, however, shows a more tender and less obviously rich, sweet personality than most of Leroy’s wines.

A distinctively wet stone cast inflects the black fruits on the very full, rounded palate, and this wine’s long, strong finish is dominated by yet more sweet black fruit, plus red licorice, with only a low-toned growl of wild animal.

Porcine, smoky meatiness is never far from the surface, though, nor is a wet stone, chalky mineral cast that segues into the wine’s fine underlying tannins. A finish of sweet black currant fruit accompanied by bitter-sweet herbal notes offers exemplary transparency to floral nuances and underlying minerals. As with the Genaivrieres, there is plenty of delicious mystery here over which to scratch one’s head.

With that usually goes plenty of structure, and the present example will disappoint no one in this regard, as there are abundant albeit fine tannins to chew on. Almost inevitably though, from stem to stern, this has the trademark Leroy sweetness and richness of in this case black cherry, and the plushness covering the tannins.

867,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Described by Mme. Leroy as being aromatically reminiscent of “a bouquet of flowers,” the perfumed, floral, red fruit-scented 2003 Romanee-St.-Vivant reveals massive depth to its red cherry, raspberry, and candied strawberry-flavored character. Medium to full-bodied, this focused, satin-textured effort combines characteristics of precociously forward fruit with firm tannin and an impressively long finish, rendering the maturity predictions exceedingly difficult. 2008-2015?

While outstanding, it appeared to lack the concentration of fruit and amazingly prolonged finishes of Mme. Leroy’s top 2003s. Projected maturity: 2008-2015.

891,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"As is often the case, Leroy’s Clos de la Roche was a standout in the 2001 vintage.

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

897,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The excellent 2001 Volnay-Santenots stands as testimony to Bize-Leroy’s conscientious vineyard and cellar work. Given the hail storm that devastated Volnay’s premier crus in 2001, it is mind-boggling that a wine of this quality could be fashioned. Its blackberry aromas lead to a broad, medium-bodied character filled with plump dark fruits. It lacks the power, concentration, as well as punch of Leroy’s finest Santenots, and reveals some stemmy characteristics in the finish, yet this wine bastes the taster’s palate with impressive layers of blackberries. It should be consumed over the next 4 years.  

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

Bize-Leroy as she poured it into my glass. Intense aromas of poached pears, toasty minerals, and butter can be found in its complex aromas. A wine of exceptional concentration (its dry extract levels must be impressive!), it is hugely rich, lush, and dense. Buttered popcorn, ripe pears, and cashews are found in its medium to full-bodied, profound personality. While some readers may opt to heed Mme.

1051,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  Her Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees is so sweet, seductive, opulent, unctuous, thick, and rich, yet never heavy or overbearing that it boggles the mind.  The taster truly senses the presence of something unreal.  One of the more forward of the Leroy 1993s, this wine can be drunk now or cellared for 20+ years.  When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

How do you describe the prodigious Nuits St.-Georges Les Boudots?  It is an awesome red Burgundy that is unconscionably concentrated, with extraordinary delineation to its personality, and massive ripeness and richness that buries what must be considerable tannin.  Approachable now, this phenomenal wine should be at its apogee by the turn of the century and drink well for 20-25 years.

1057,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The extraordinary Volnay Santenots is a black/purple-colored wine with humongous levels of fruit, full body, and fabulous purity and presence in the mouth.  There is some tannin, but as in all Leroy's 1993s, it is sweet and ripe.  If you can resist it, give this wine 5-6 years of cellaring and drink it over the following 25+ years.  When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

1063,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The best value in Domaine Leroy's portfolio comes from the Cote de Beaune.  An exceptionally great wine produced by Bize-Leroy in 1992 is the Volnay Les Santenots.  Having tasted it several times from cask and twice from bottle, I can unequivocally state that the 1992 Volnay Les Santenots is a blockbuster, super-rich, authoritatively flavored yet wonderfully harmonious, elegant example of Volnay.  The color is a saturated dark ruby and the nose offers up super-intense, jammy scents of sweet black-cherry fruit intertwined with oak and floral notes.  It is a wine of extraordinary intensity, power, richness, and overall grace and harmony.  This is a winemaking tour de force!  Moreover, this must be the ""bargain"" wine of her portfolio.  It should drink well between 1998-2015.

I have said it so many times that it may seem redundant, but if you missed it in my 1990 tome, Burgundy, Lalou Bize-Leroy stands virtually alone at the top of Burgundy's quality hierarchy. Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.  Although not as phenomenally concentrated and extracted as her 1991s and 1990s, the 1992s are more closely aligned to her sumptuous 1989s.

Supple, full-bodied, never heavy or tannic, this smooth-as-silk wine is so concentrated that some powerful tannin is nearly hidden by the wine's gorgeous richness.

1070,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 1992 Nuits St.-Georges aux Bas de Combe is one of the softer, more opulent and fleshy wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy.  It displays a dark ruby color, a big, earthy, licorice, truffle, and black-cherry-scented nose, ripe, medium to full-bodied flavors, and a soft, velvety-textured finish.  It should drink well for 15+ years.

I have said it so many times that it may seem redundant, but if you missed it in my 1990 tome, Burgundy, Lalou Bize-Leroy stands virtually alone at the top of Burgundy's quality hierarchy.  Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.  Although not as phenomenally concentrated and extracted as her 1991s and 1990s, the 1992s are more closely aligned to her sumptuous 1989s.

1071,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Lalou Bize-Leroy is assuming a stronger position in the village of Chambolle-Musigny and she has turned out a very fine 1992 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres.  The wine boasts an elegant, floral, vanillin, and cherry-scented nose, medium-bodied, concentrated flavors, a supple, velvety texture, and an easy-going, graceful, complex finish.  It should drink well for 12-15 years.  I did not have an opportunity to taste out of bottle Lalou's Musigny and Chambertin, but several cask tastings (she does not fine or filter) revealed that the 1992 Musigny looked to be the best wine in her entire portfolio.  It possessed that extra dimension of finesse as well as sensational concentration and a velvety-textured, sweet, ripe palate.  The 1992 Chambertin was also terrific, but perhaps less complex and impressive when compared to the Musigny.  If I get the chance to taste either or both of these wines from bottle on this side of the Atlantic, I will update readers with my opinions.

The 1992 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons reveals a dark, saturated ruby color, a tight but promising nose of spice, black-cherries, and earth, and medium to full-bodied, concentrated flavors.

Once again, the remarkable Lalou Bize-Leroy and her gifted winemaker, Andre Porcheret, have made the wines of the vintage.

These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.
Produced according to the rigid disciplines of organic farming biodynamics, Lalou Bize-Leroy's 1991s are extraordinary.

NOTES ON THE 1992s FROM BARREL:  In what was a relatively light vintage for the Cote de Nuits, superb 1992s were produced at Leroy.

Picking a favorite is akin to splitting hairs, as they are all super-rich, densely colored, broadly built, expansive, full-bodied Pinot Noirs with superb complexity and richness.  The most opulent, hedonistic, and decadent of this trio of premier crus is the 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Boudots.  Its huge, exotic nose of smoke, ripe cassis fruit, herbs, minerals, and roasted nuts is a turn-on.  Low in acid, this blockbuster, massively concentrated, voluptuously-textured wine is a knock-out.  Drink it over the next 15-18 years.

It offers a decadent nose of smoked duck, grilled meats, black fruits, spices, and truffle-like smells. Superb black-cherry fruit flavors are loaded with glycerin and extract.

A moderately intense bouquet of red fruits, flowers, and vanillin is followed by rich, medium-bodied, silky-textured flavors that are brilliantly well-defined and long.  One of the smoothest, most seductive 1991s, it should be drunk over the next 12-15 years, although I suspect Leroy would consider that infanticide.

Once again, the remarkable Lalou Bize-Leroy and her gifted winemaker, Andre Porcheret, have made the wines of the vintage.  Of course, Ponsot's Chambertin, Clos St.-Denis, and Clos de la Roche offer worthy competition, but considering the numerous vineyards she possesses, and the remarkable success she has enjoyed with all of them, she gets the gold medal in 1991.  These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.
Produced according to the rigid disciplines of organic farming biodynamics, Lalou Bize-Leroy's 1991s are extraordinary.

NOTES ON THE 1992s FROM BARREL:  In what was a relatively light vintage for the Cote de Nuits, superb 1992s were produced at Leroy.  Sadly, because of difficult weather in 1993 and Bize-Leroy's refusal to utilize anti-rot fungicides, over 80% of the crop was destroyed.  Consequently, there will be little wine coming from Leroy in 1993.",,RP 89

The overall impression is of a supple-textured, ripe, concentrated, impressive wine with at least 12-15 years of cellaring potential.

With its dark, dense, ruby color and rich nose of ripe black fruits, this medium to full-bodied, supple wine is better than most premier crus.  Low yields and impeccable winemaking have elevated its quality to an amazingly high level.

1087,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1991 Corton-Charlemagne from Domaine Leroy needs at least 10 years of cellaring.  It is a candidate for 25-30 years of aging.  Huge and massive, with great density, it is totally unevolved, with a reticent bouquet.  The power, weight, and density are something to behold, but this is an infantile, backward wine that should be purchased only by consumers with cold cellars and plenty of patience.  If you had a child born in 1991 and want a Chardonnay grand cru for his or her 21st birthday, this would be a great choice.

Lalou Bize-Leroy produced some remarkable 1991 white burgundies.  Yields averaged only 9 hectoliters per hectare in her Chardonnay vineyards and alcohol levels averaged 13.5%.  These wines will be the longest-lived whites of the 1991 vintage.

Consistently the finest wine made in that appellation, it achieves grand cru quality because of its extraordinary richness and multidimensional character.  The 1990 is awesome.  The forceful bouquet, which is just beginning to form, soars from the glass, offering up aromas of minerals, toasty oak, and gobs of black fruit.  In the mouth, there is magnificent richness, medium to full-body, and a layered, multi-dimensional, chewy texture that goes on and on.  The moderate tannins are nearly obscured by the wine's sweet concentration of fruit.  Anticipated maturity: 1996-2010+.

I suppose there is a natural tendency to overlook Madame Leroy's wines from the Cote de Beaune.  She, along with Faiveley and Jadot, makes one of the more flavorful generic red burgundies.

The sweet nose of coffee, caramel, black-cherries, and earth is a turn-on.  In the mouth, this full-bodied, voluptuously textured, superbly concentrated wine with no hard edges exhibits lavish quantities of jammy fruit buttressed nicely by new oak, decent acidity, and moderate tannins.  Although precocious, it needs another 4-5 years to develop even further, and should last for 20-25  years.

However, for now it must take a back seat to the other two wines. It is a big, rich, earthy, cinnamon, almost raunchy-scented wine, but is sensationally concentrated and full bodied, with fabulous balance and precision to its flavors.

This is sheer class, although I believe young Maxime will make even better in the future.",,RP (91-93)
1129,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaumonts has a fragrant bouquet with Morello cherry, ripe strawberry, overripe Satsuma and floral scents emerging with time in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe tannin, finely tuned acidity and a sense of energy permeating throughout. The new oak here is deftly integrated and does not impede the terroir, while the tongue tingles long after the wine has departed. Excellent. ",,RP (91-93)
1130,Georges Noellat,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Matured entirely in new oak and the only cru to include whole-bunch fruit (20%), the 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a very sensual bouquet with kirsch, rose petals, a touch of licorice and minerals, here the oak neatly integrated into the fruit profile. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins. This feels spicy in the mouth with plenty of substance and good tension, although I would not describe it as the Echézeaux ’13 with the most finesse. This is burlier and more forthright, an Echézeaux that comes straight to the point. Very fine.",,RP (91-93)
1131,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Petits Monts,"The 2013 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Petits Monts had a slight reduction on the nose. Even so, the 80% new oak is noticeable, and like the les Chaumes ’13, I feel that it blurs the nuances of the vineyard. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly “furry” tannin. Moderate weight in the mouth with a slight ferrous note, it gently builds to a spicy finish not unlike a Chambolle-Musigny. This is a decent les Petits Monts but I would have still dialed down the new oak level. ",,RP (91-93)
1132,Georges Noellat,Nuits Saint-Georges Village,"The 2013 Nuits St Georges Villages which comes from the lieu-dit Bas de Combes, although for some reason Maxime does not state it on the label, was matured in 50% new oak. It has a light redcurrant and cranberry leaf bouquet. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and crisp acidity. There is a touch of balsamic enlivening the finish and a lingering white pepper note on the aftertaste. Enjoy this over the next 3 or 4 years. ",,RP (91-93)
1133,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2013 Vosne Romanée Village, raised in 50% new oak, has a light raspberry preserve, strawberry-scented bouquet that needs just a little more definition. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannin, crunchy redcurrant and cranberry fruit with a nicely poised, easygoing finish.",,RP (91-93)
1134,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts has a reserved bouquet, but one that is nicely detailed with raspberry, wild strawberry and mineral notes, then upon further investigation, overripe apricot and blueberry jam. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe juicy tannins, well-judged acidity and quite a tensile, verging on “tinny” finish. It feels backward and primal, but the long, spicy aftertaste indicates that this will age long term. This has the edge over the Les Petits Monts at the moment.",,RP (91-93)
1135,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Petits Monts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The nose on Nöellat’s 2011 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Petits Monts seems to be slightly more forward than other wines in its peer group, with touches of marmalade infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly tough tannins, here more backward with a strong saline, rather reserved finish. It needs to gain more harmony in bottle, but at least it does seem to coalesce in the glass. ",,RP (91-93)
1136,Georges Noellat,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots 2011 feels totally reduced on the nose more than any other wine in the 2011 tasting. The palate is chewy and disjointed with an over-extracted finish that feels labored compared to its peers. Vexing after the stellar 2012 from barrel - I will endeavor to re-evaluate this wine.,,RP (91-93)
1137,Georges Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Beau Monts has another very pure fragrant bouquet that errs toward red rather than black fruit, unlike the Petit-Monts, but likewise it is extremely well-defined. The palate is very harmonious with Maxime Cheurlin’s trademark velvety texture: layer upon layer of ravishing red fruit wrapped up in creamy new oak that recalls the great Sylvain Cathiard’s wines. This exudes panache and deserves five years in bottle. 

“Noellat” might be a name synonymous with Vosne-Romanee for decades. However 22-year-old Maxime Cheurlin, Georges Noellat’s nephew, is a name to look for in the future. He grew up in Champagne rather than the Cote d’Or since his parents run a successful champagne house, but it seems that Maxime heard the calling and seems intent on reinstalling the family name in Burgundy. With some enviable parcels of vine scattered around the locale, Maxime works out of the family’s small cellars just behind his parents’ house whose conservatory offers a fantastic panorama across their holding of Les Chaumees. Stylistically, these wines reminded me of Sylvain Cathiard. Yes, there is a modern sheen lent by the new oak, although it only seemed to be slightly excessive with respect to the Echezeaux. Maxime seems to be a driven young vigneron whose tenets have been instilled from an early age, but wow – what potential!

It has an attractive candied essence on the pure, feminine, almost “wily” nose. The palate is silky smooth and fleshy on the entry with a dash of white pepper enlivening the sumptuous finish. Very gourmand! Give this a couple of years in bottle before calling for the waiter’s friend.

There is lovely focus here. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, very well judged acidity and a svelte, strawberry and raspberry confit finish that lingers nicely. This is struck through with sophistication and class...a case of less equals more.  ",,RP (91-93)

It has a deep, broody, well defined bouquet with macerated dark cherries and cassis aromas, the mineralité just below the surface. The palate is dense and structured for the vintage, plenty of black cherry and cassis fruit once again with a patina of new oak filling out the finish. It will need several years to really show what it can do -- be patient.",,RP (91-93)
1142,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Beaux Monts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has a touch of vanilla that infuses the quite lush red cherry and strawberry fruit, paradoxically becoming a little tighter rather than opening in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a ripe, sweet entry, a dash of white pepper here with a broad-shouldered, quite generous finish that perhaps just needs a little more detail.

1144,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2014 Bourgogne Rouge had been in vat for three weeks. It has a light and airy bouquet with tart red cherry fruit.

The 2012 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru from Domaine Georges Noëllat takes time to settle in the glass, some initial volatility eventually fading away to leave a rather attractive nose of redcurrant jam, spice-box and desiccated orange peel. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin. This is very well balanced, backward of course, but the structure lends this a sense of symmetry and precision that leaves you wanting to take another sip. This is bestowed that aristocratic class that you seek in a Grands Echézeaux. Bravo Maxime.",,RP (91-93)

The 2012 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Boudots from young Maxime Chuerlin is slightly deeper in colour than its peers. It has an intense dark cherry, blueberry and cassis-scented nose that is relatively modern in style, well crafted and detailed. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet ripe tannin, well-judged acidity, sensual in style, more voluminous and richer than Méo-Camuzet's Aux Murgers 2012, but retaining impressive delineation and terroir expression. This is an excellent contribution to the vintage. ",,RP (91-93)

The 2012 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaumont from winemaker Maxime Chuerlin feels quite dumb on the nose, very reduced (again!) and consequently deprive of terroir expression.

1177,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Village,"In this low-yielding vintage, Pierre-Yves Colin opted to produce a 2019 Meursault Village, blending fruit from Narvaux (which he often bottles as a lieu-dit cuvée) with grapes from Grands Charrons and Vireuils.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with good depth at the core, incisive acids and a palpable sense of chalky dry extract.

1208,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières,"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières—which, like the higher appellations, had been racked and returned to barrel when I tasted it—is showing very well, wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, fresh peach, nutmeg and mandarin oil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, fleshy and textural, with good depth and weight at the core, tangy balancing acids and a mouthwatering finish.

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny textured and deep at the core, with a blocky, somewhat rustic profile underpinned by incisive acids. This bottling is produced from purchased fruit.",,RP (90-92)
1213,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"Aromas of hazelnut cream, green orchard fruit, crisp white peach and spring flowers introduce the 2017 Meursault Les Narvaux, a medium to full-bodied wine with good depth at the core, bright acids and chalky structuring dry extract.

1219,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"There's one barrel of the 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, and while it doesn't have the depth or completeness of the Bâtard, it's also very impressive. Exhibiting aromas of preserved lemon, vanilla pod, brioche and toasty oak, it's concentrated and vertical, but it will need a bit of time to come together.

1221,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"While this bottling is usually a blend of nearly equal parts Pernand- and Aloxe-side fruit, the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru hails almost entirely from the Aloxe side due to the year's devastating frosts.

1226,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Pierre-Yves Colin purchases the grapes that produced his 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes, but he farms the parcel himself. And it's a success in this challenging vintage, exhibiting dramatic aromas of peach and preserved citrus, framed by nutty new oak.

1229,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Cuvée Marguerite,"In the frost-ravaged 2016 vintage, many Saint-Aubin producers opted to blend premiers crus that they ordinarily bottle separately, and that's the case with Pierre-Yves Colin's 2016 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Cuvée Marguerite, a blend of the lieux-dits En Créot, Les Combes and Perrières. The combination is very successful, offering up a classy bouquet of peach pit, green orchard fruit, toasted hazelnuts and a light framing of reduction. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, deep and chewy, with a glossy attack and a deep core. Structurally firm, even somewhat rustic, it's a cuvée to forget for several years in the cellar.",,RP (90-92)
1230,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"Aromas of paraffin wax, smoky pear, oatmeal and subtle petrol introduce the 2016 Meursault Les Narvaux, an ample but medium-bodied wine with a broad, textural profile and excellent overall harmony, though it lacks the depth and tension of Pierre-Yves Colin's best vintages.",,RP (90-92)
1231,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"The 2016 Saint Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly is quite elegant and open-knit this year, though I can imagine it gaining weight and depth with a bit of bottle age.

1234,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines,"Pierre-Yves Colin's 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines is another premier cru that seems a touch facile this year, revealing a pretty nose of roasted notes, ripe orchard fruit and peach pit, followed by a glossy, medium-bodied plate that's pretty and nicely balanced but lacks some concentration and depth.",,RP (90-92)

Well-balanced and beautifully made, I suspect these 15-year-old vines simply struggled to recover from the challenges of the growing season.",,RP (90-92)
1237,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"The 2016 Saint-Aubin Le Banc is another pretty wine from Pierre-Yves Colin, exhibiting expressive aromas of white flowers, tangerine oil and crisp apple. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, pure and glossy, with attractive detail and delineation. Structurally delicate and open-knit, this is a wine to broach while the 2015 is maturing in the cellar.",,RP (90-92)
1238,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"Produced largely from second-generation grapes, the 2016 Bourgogne Chardonnay is a nice wine in a challenging vintage, but it's an appreciable step behind other recent vintages. The wine offers up fragrant aromas of peach, citrus pith and struck match, followed by a bright, light to medium-bodied palate with moderate texture and tangy acids. Right now, it's a little angular, but I expect it to round out in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1239,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru from Pierre-Yves Colin is fabulous, and one of the white wines of the vintage. The youthfully reserved bouquet blossoms in the glass, revealing notes of preserved lemon, petrol, beeswax, toasted nuts and white flowers, continuing to gain in detail and complexity over the course of several days. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and complete, with immense depth and substance, bright acids, and a tight-knit core. For all its power and chewy extract, this is in fact a decidedly reserved, harmonious wine which deserves prolonged aging. Though he doesn't own them, Pierre-Yves farms these 90-year-old vines in Bâtard (on the Chassagne side, but bordering Puligny), and they clearly knew how to handle the heat in 2015.",,RP (90-92)
1240,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2015 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Caillerets is excellent, wafting from the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of white flowers, lemon oil, struck match and wet stones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, tensile and complete, with excellent depth at the core, terrific purity, and chalky grip on the long, beautifully balanced and searingly intense finish. This is still somewhat withdrawn after its April 2017 bottling, but it has all the elements for greatness with some bottle age.",,RP (90-92)
1241,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"The 2015 Saint Aubin 1e Cru en Remilly is superb, opening in the glass with aromas of apple, iodine, lightly toasted nuts and a subtle top note of mint. On the palate, the wine is cool, medium to full-bodied and concentrated, with a broad attack, sappy acids, a deep core and a chalky, pure finish. Effortlessly poised and with lovely textural refinement, this Saint-Aubin—which was bottled in January 2017—is still quite reserved, especially by the standards of the often rather generous, giving 2015 vintage. Give it at least a handful of years in the cellar to realize all its potential.",,RP (90-92)
1242,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is very fine, offering up notes of preserved citrus, white peach, toasted nuts and petrol. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and powerful, with a deep core and serious structural musculature, juicy acids, and a long, chewy finish. This is notably deeper and more complete than it showed from barrel in the fall of 2016, which seems to confirm Pierre-Yves's observation that in his experience Corton-Charlemagne is one of the wines that benefits most from long élevage.",,RP (90-92)
1243,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"From barrel, the 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrieres offers up a lovely nose of green pear, apple, chamomile and wheat toast, framed by light reduction which dissipates in the glass. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, bright and penetrating, with a lovely line of acidity, good depth and concentration, and nice chalky grip on the long finish.  This was one of the highlights of Pierre-Yves Colin's range from barrel, and it is equally compelling from bottle. Among Pierre-Yves' higher-appellation 2015s, which were all bottled in April 2017, it's also one of the more forthcoming in its youth, though its true potential will only be realized with bottle age.",,RP (90-92)
1244,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"Pierre-Yves Colin's 2015 Bourgogne Chardonnay is a lovely wine in this vintage, offering up a classy bouquet of preserved lemon, fresh pear, wheat toast and a judicious top note of smoky reduction. On the palate the wine is medium-bodied and quite tense for the vintage and appellation, with a bright line of acidity, good depth and intensity, and a precise finish. A lovely introduction to the house style. I followed a bottle from my own cellar over three days, and the last glass was the best.",,RP (90-92)
1245,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru offers crisp, almost clinical aromas of cold stone and flint, with just a judicious touch of reduction that enhances the overall effect. It takes time to gather momentum, but after a couple of minutes it really develops fine intensity. The palate is very well balanced with a live-wire opening: real energy and tension, superb salinity and a very long finish that fans out gloriously. Without a doubt, this is Pierre-Yves Colin's finest 2015—an absolute gem.",,RP (90-92)
1246,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières has a crisp, wet stone and flinty bouquet that gains complexity as it aerates in the glass. There is wonderful detail here and impressive focus. The palate is crisp and taut with a killer line of acidity, just the right amount of salinity and there is impressive complexity and mineralité running all the way through to the finish. There is a tangible sense of confidence on this Les Perrières; it is one of Pierre-Yves Colin's best contributions to the 2015 vintage. This is superb.",,RP (90-92)
1247,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Combes,"The 2015 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Combes comes from a vineyard that did not suffer the dryness during the season according to Pierre-Yves Colin. It has an enticing bouquet with lively citrus fruit, orange rind and dandelion scents, well defined and focused. The palate is fresh and lively on the entry. This Les Combes offers superb mineral tension, great depth in the mouth with a precise and vibrant, lightly spiced finish. This is a superb Saint-Aubin from Pierre-Yves.",,RP (90-92)
1248,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie is a small cuvée of just four barrels, one of which is new this year. The bouquet is attractive with delicate aromas of white peach, citrus peel and a hint of passion fruit that gently unfold in the glass. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with crisp acidity, citrus lemon and tangy orange peel, leading to a focused and energetic finish. This is an excellent, beautifully crafted Chassagne-Montrachet from Pierre-Yves Colin.",,RP (90-92)
1249,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has a pleasing richness and generosity on the nose: citrus fruit, a touch of dried pineapple and later with aeration, attractive almost resinous/candlewax aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, a little grainy and certainly quite saline in style. There is a cheeky dab of lemon sherbet on the finish to complete what is a very fine Meursault Charmes, one that actually surpasses the 2014.",,RP (90-92)
1250,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot,"The 2015 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot has a gorgeous bouquet with yellow flowers piercing the citrus fruit, touches of lime flower and lemon curd emerging with continued aeration. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, lively with orange rind and melon notes, the acidity lending this Chassagne fine edginess and energy. It remains quite linear, refusing to fan out on the finish, but that does not detract from a well-crafted and delicious wine.",,RP (90-92)
1251,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Les Poruzots,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Poruzots has a tightly wound bouquet, quite Puligny-like in style, flint and smoke, more tertiary than Pierre-Yves' other cuvées. The palate is well balanced with a well-defined, lemongrass-tinged opening. This is a richer style of Meursault, yet still detailed and focused, that spiciness continuing all the way through to the finish.",,RP (90-92)
1252,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"The 2015 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots has a tightly wound, more fumé inspired bouquet with touches of cold flint emerging with time. This is certainly a more reserved Saint-Aubin aromatically speaking. The palate is fresh on the entry with a pleasant salinity, more so than the other Saint Aubin premier crus, with a Muscadet-like, Atlantic tang on the finish. This is a well-crafted, characterful Saint-Aubin from Pierre-Yves Colin.",,RP (90-92)
1253,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Les Pucelles,"The 2015 Saint-Aubin Les Pucelles has a perfumed bouquet, a little chalkier than the 2015 Le Banc with intriguing red fruit aromas emanating from the glass—crushed strawberry and red cherries. The palate is saline on the entry with crisp acidity, notes of Conference pear mixed with Granny Smith apples, leading to a tightly-wound and again, chalky-textured finish. This is very Puligny-like, perhaps no surprise given the name of the lieu-dit!",,RP (90-92)
1254,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines was one of Pierre-Yves' wines to show a touch of reduction on the nose and this slightly detracted from its delineation. The palate is well balanced with fine weight in the mouth, although that element of reduction persists, therefore I advise giving it two to three years once in bottle, because a very decent Chassagne will eventually emerge.",,RP (90-92)
1255,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2015 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Perrieres has a crisp, limestone-scented bouquet, almost flinty. I appreciate the reserve of this Saint-Aubin, quite Puligny-like in style. The palate is well balanced with fresh, you could call it ""zippy"" green fruit on the entry, although I found that the second half does not quite deliver the same complexity as the Les Combes and leaves you wanting more.",,RP (90-92)
1256,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chenevottes,"The 2015 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Chenevottes has a touch more richness on the nose compared to the Maltroie, hints of clear honey, candy floss and almond. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, the oak showing through a little more than other cuvées, but with satsifying weight and length on the walnut-tinged finish. I was just seeking a little more detail here, but it should drink well for several years.",,RP (90-92)
1257,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne has a reserved, limestone and lime flower-scented bouquet, just a touch of stone fruit in the background. The palate has a slight bitterness on the entry, then it settles down and offers crisp kiwi fruit, gooseberry and Granny Smith notes towards the linear finish. Give this a year in bottle for it to open up.",,RP (90-92)
1258,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Créots,"From vines planted 16 years ago, so relatively young amongst Pierre-Yves crus, is the 2015 Saint Aubin 1er Cru Les Creots. Its more clayey soils impart a slightly heavier bouquet than others, with bruised apple and kiwi fruit aromas, a touch of granite in the background. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite harmonious in the mouth with an edgy, dewy green apple finish that just needs a little more length.",,RP (90-92)
1259,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières,"The 2015 Chassagne Montrachet les Ancegnieres, which was taken from barrel, has a clean and crisp nose that perhaps lacks the ""sparkle"" of its village cru counterparts in Saint-Aubin. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite brisk and lively with a touch of lemongrass towards the grainy finish. It actually finishes better than it begins, although it needs a tad more persistence in the mouth.",,RP (90-92)
1260,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2015 Meursault Les Narvaux has an upfront, quite extroverted bouquet with marzipan and nutmeg-tinged citrus fruit, a little raucous but there is nothing wrong with that. The palate is well balanced with orange cordial and tangerine notes, nicely balanced, although I feel that the warmth of the growing season just shaved away a little definition on the finish.",,RP (90-92)
1261,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru has a gorgeous bouquet with granite and flint intermixed with apricot blossom, lemon curd and later, yellow flowers. This is mercurial in the glass, constantly bringing you back. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity -- nectarine and white peach, a touch of the fine lees towards the finish that fans out gloriously. Long in the mouth, nuanced and charming, there is a sense of completeness emanating from this ""knight"". Is it the best 2014 Chevalier-Montrachet that I tasted from barrel? Maybe not, but it is still a very fine Grand Cru.",,RP (93-95)
1262,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru, from the Chassagne side from 75-year-old vines, has a precise, understated, mineral-driven bouquet with a distant tang of oyster shell. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, harmonious in the mouth with a keen thread of minerality with a pixelated finish that lingers in the mouth. What a succinct expression of this grand cru from Pierre-Yves.",,RP (93-95)
1263,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Caillerets has that quintessential white Burgundy on limestone soil nose with hints of chalk and flint developing with aeration, all with fine precision and impressive intensity. The palate is fresh and vibrant, a keen bitter edge like the 2014 Baudines, perhaps with great tension and nervosity towards the finish. This deserves a couple of years in bottle after bottling next year. Excellent.",,RP (93-95)
1264,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines,"The 2014 ChassagneMontrachet 1er Cru les Baudines has a curiously Meursault-like bouquet, thanks to a tincture of hazelnut and smoke that evolves with aeration. The palate is very well balanced with a keen thread of acidity, lively and saline in the mouth with a twist of citrus lemon on the focused finish. I like the bitter edge here. This is a lovely Chassagne-Montrachet.",,RP (93-95)
1265,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Champlots has a detailed and precise bouquet with hints of yellow flower infusing the citrus fruit, delicate but very nicely focused. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry, a nice bitter edge to this Saint Aubin with impressive nervosity towards the clean and pure finish. Good length here - one of Pierre-Yves's best Saint Aubin.",,RP (93-95)
1266,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is much more expressive than the Meursault Charmes at this stage - great minerality, a little more verve and animation. The palate is taut on the entry with a fine line of acidity, satisfying depth and grip with a persistent, walnut and sea salt finish that just goes on and on. This is one of several great wines from this premier cru in 2014, and is one of Pierre-Yves' best contributions to the vintage.",,RP (93-95)
1267,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières possesses a taut, granitic and slightly fumé-style bouquet that is well defined. It is not as expressive as the Genevrières, though it is very typical of the vineyard. The palate is fresh on the entry with hints of mandarin and dried apricot infusing the citrus fruit. There is excellent weight and penetration here, although I would like to see just a touch more mineral nerve come through on the finish by the time it is in bottle. Still, another sublime offering from Pierre-Yves.",,RP (93-95)
1268,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chenevottes,"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes has a clean and precise bouquet -- a bouquet with a steely gaze. The palate is clean and fresh with a lovely bead of acidity interwoven through the brioche and walnut-tinged fruit, gently building towards a very harmonious finish. This is a great Chassagne-Montrachet from Pierre-Yves -- and I love that spiciness that lingers as I'm typing these last words.",,RP (93-95)
1269,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru La Chatenière,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru Chatenière has a more reserved and laconic bouquet compared to Pierre-Yves's other 2014 Saint Aubins, more backward and requiring more cellar time. The palate is fresh and crisp, quite precise with nectarine and lemon peel notes, peach following later with a light brush of honey. This is a punter-friendly Saint Aubin and I don't intend that in a bad way - just a wine that is delicious to its core.",,RP (93-95)
1270,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru en Remilly, much to my surprise, had the least expressive bouquet compared to the five other Saint Aubins from PYCM. This is clearly intent on biding its time. The palate is fresh and poised, here unfurling with each swirl of the glass to reveal notes of white peach, freshly-sliced pear and a touch of salinity lending tension on the finish. I would like the aromatics to find its voice during the next couple of years.",,RP (93-95)
1271,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet les Ancegnières is populated with Pierre-Yves's oldest vines, around 85- to 90-years-old. It has a very composed bouquet with citrus peel, hints of honeycomb and lemon thyme that are well defined. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with plenty of roundness, giving and generous with a sensual, honeyed finish that has just the right amount of tropical overtones without becoming blowsy. This is lovely, but I would be tempted to drink this soon after it is bottled.",,RP (93-95)
1272,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru is a blend of Pernand and Aloxe-Corton fruit, whereas the previous vintage was just the latter due to hail damage. Interestingly, Pierre-Yves told me that he always picks both sites on the same date (around September 15). It has a clean and precise bouquet, although like many, it just seems to lack the animation, the minerality of some of the fine premier cru sites in the Côte de Beaune. The palate is nicely balanced with a keen thread of acidity, though it just seems to attenuate a little towards the finish.",,RP (93-95)
1273,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Créots,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru Les Creots has a little more tropicana on the nose, nicely defined with hints of guava and pineapple coming through with aeration. The palate is tensile on the entry with quite noticdable acidity (although that might be because my sample was taken directly from the cellar unlike the others). Quite reserved, linear and stoic, it just needs a little more persistence on the finish.",,RP (93-95)
1274,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Combes,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Combes has a rounded and sensual bouquet like the 2014 Le Banc, peach skin and pear notes developing in the glass with just a hint of almond. The palate is very well balanced with the entry with good weight in the mouth. There is a nice malic edge to this Saint Aubin that counterbalances the richness towards the lightly honeyed finish. Drink over the next 5-8 years.",,RP (93-95)
1275,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has a touch of pineapple and apricot on the nose that perhaps would benefit from a little more delineation and nervosity. The palate is well balanced with orange zest and apricot notes, but I don't think this Meursault is up there with Pierre-Yves excellent Chassagne-Montrachets this year; it feels a little denuded of joie-de-vivre on the finish. This leaves you wanting more...hopefully that will develop in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1276,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Perrières has a slight reduction on the nose, fine definition and minerality coming through with aeration, though it needs more encouragement than the 2014 Les Combes. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry, with touches of white peach and citrus peel; there is very good weight on the mid-palate, though I would like to see more nervous energy develop on the finish. Still, this is very fine.",,RP (93-95)
1277,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot,"The 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Abbaye de Morgeot is a new offering from Pierre-Yves from a 0.5-hectare parcel of 15-year-old vines. It has a reserved, nutmeg and grilled almond-scented nose that just needs to develop a little more intensity. The palate is clean and tensile on the entry, with a hint of sour lemon mixed with rosewater and peach; it is delicate and charming, nothing overly complex here (perhaps due to the relatively younger vines), but there is impressive persistence on the finish.",,RP (93-95)
1278,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne was very taciturn on the nose when I tasted it at the domaine, perhaps having difficultly following the more flamboyant of the Chassagne-Montrachets. The palate is well balanced with lime and green apple on the entry, but it never quite builds upon its initial promise and seems just a little conservative, perhaps predictable on the finish. Let's see if it develops more personality by the time of bottling.",,RP (93-95)
1279,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"The 2014 Saint Aubin le Banc has quite a generous bouquet with flakes of almond and coconut, a hint of lime flower in the background. The palate is rounded and sensual on the entry, perhaps slightly lower acidity than its peers, although this simply just makes it more irresistible in its youth. The kind of wine you just want to ""neck"".",,RP (93-95)
1280,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2009 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes from Pierre-Yves Colin is sitting in a sweet spot, though don't be afraid of keeping it in your cellar for another decade or two. Yet it is offering so much at the moment. It has an expressive bouquet that translates the lushness and precocity of the growing season - tropical fruit, almond and a hint of vanilla. What I like about this Meursault is that Pierre-Yves managed to lock in the acidity in order to counter the ripeness. The texture here is quite rounded, almost honeyed compared to other vintages but that acidity keeps a tight rein on things. It's just a delightful, opulent Meursault Charmes.",,RP (93-95)
1281,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a much more reserved bouquet than the Bâtard-Montrachet ’13 at this point, but beautifully defined and regal. The palate is very well balanced with crisp acidity, razor-sharp in the mouth and real “fire” on the finish without losing its head. Very long on the aftertaste, this is a mighty fine Chevalier that ranks alongside the best this vintage.",,RP (93-95)
1282,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières has a fragrant bouquet with yellow plum, honeysuckle and jasmine scents, although I would like to see more mineralité expressed by the time of bottling. The palate is crisp and edgy on the entry. There is very good concentration here, well-judged acidity and it fans out wonderfully on the animated, lingering finish. This has great potential and constitutes one of the best Meursault Perrières that I have encountered this vintage.",,RP (93-95)
1283,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a very expressive bouquet like many Bâtard ‘13s from barrel: white peach, Mirin and apricot blossom, wonderful mineralité coming through with aeration. The palate is very well balanced, not a million miles away from the Meursault Perrières, with a great crescendo of fruit on the spicy finish. Excellent.",,RP (93-95)
1284,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru La Chatenière,"The 2013 Saint Aubin 1er Cru Chatenière is initially reticent on the nose, but it unfolds with time in the glass with delicate orange blossom and white peach aromas that remain very well defined. The palate is crisp and tensile on the entry. There is a wonderful salinity here, very good persistence in the mouth with a taut, linear finish that begs another sip. Top class.",,RP (93-95)
1285,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"The 2013 Saint Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly possesses the best nose of Pierre-Yves’s Saint Aubin premier crus with apricot blossom and lime-flower scents intermingling with the mineral notes. The palate is very well balanced with a taut line of acidity, very good weight in the mouth but not “fatness."" The tension is maintained from the start to the graceful and focused finish. Pick of the bunch from P-Y's Saint Aubin? Definitely.",,RP (93-95)
1286,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru comes from purchased grapes and for the first time they come entirely from the Aloxe-Corton side. The bouquet is sophisticated and beautifully defined with touches of quince and yellow plum, later white peach. The palate is very well balanced with a taut line of acidity that renders this very linear and direct, quite pointed and penetrating on the finish. This should be intriguing once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1287,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2013 Saint Aubin les Perrières is another new fermage from Pierre-Yves’s aunt. It has a very expressive bouquet, the limestone soils really lending race and tension to the aromatics. The palate is very well balanced with a keen thread of acidity counterbalancing the subtle apricot and Clementine notes. There is plenty of heft on the linear and ""strict"" finish, completing what is a very assured Saint Aubin from Pierre-Yves.",,RP (93-95)
1288,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes has an exotic peach and apricot-scented bouquet, later yellow plum and candied orange peel. The palate is rounded in the mouth with plenty of fruit concentration, the finish quite weighty, but nicely counterpoised by the acidity. This is one Meursault where I think stopping the malo early really benefited the wine. It should be drinking beautifully once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1289,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"The 2013 Saint Aubin 1er Cru Champlots has a more austere bouquet compared to Pierre-Yves's other premier crus: stony, touches of damp moss in an old churchyard. The palate is well balanced with sharp acidity on the entry: sour lemon, hints of apricot with quite an intense saline finish, this is a very well-crafted Saint Aubin that should repay time in the cellar. There's something enigmatic about this wine.",,RP (93-95)
1290,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru les Caillerets has a slight reduction on the nose, although there seems to be plenty of fruit and mineralité underneath. The palate is well balanced with sour lemon, orange rind and white peach, the acidity noticeable and lending the finish and certain steeliness at the moment. This has good length in the mouth and should turn out to be a sterling Chassagne.",,RP (93-95)
1291,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Créots,"The 2013 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Creots has very fine mineralité on the nose: flint and wet limestone, almost Puligny-like in style. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, hints of orange zest and lime with a dash of spice to round things off nicely on the finish. It does not quite have the complexity of a top climats, but it is still very well crafted and should offer a decade of drinking pleasure, possibly more.",,RP (93-95)
1292,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Champs Gain,The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gain has a little more fruit intensity on the nose compared to the Chenevottes '13: very well defined with flint scents merging with apple blossom and struck match. The palate is smooth and nicely rounded on the entry: spice-infused apricot with white peach and a touch of lemongrass enlivening the finish. This is very fine - a classy number.,,RP (93-95)
1293,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières has a slightly muffled bouquet compared to the Meursault Charmes '13 at the moment. The palate is nicely balanced with a keen thread of acidity, orange zest and citrus lemon vying for attention with fine precision on the finish. Hopefully, the aromatics will achieve more clarity once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1294,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Baudines,"The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru les Baudines has a more resinous, waxy bouquet compared to the Champ Gain, with touches of apple peel and fresh pear coming through later. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, vibrant citric fruit and a dash of lemongrass lending spice to the finish that just misses a little persistence at the moment.",,RP (93-95)
1295,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne has a more refined bouquet than the '13 Champ Gain: very pure with more peachy aromas filtering through. The palate is well defined and shows a touch more tension and edginess than the Champ Gain at this stage, although I feel that the best Chassagne 2013s show more persistency. Still, this might hold a few surprises when it is in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1296,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2013 Meursault Narvaux has a generous bouquet with scents of lemon curd and apricot drifting from the glass. The palate is well balanced with a pleasant fatness in the mouth, rounded in texture with a spicy, lemongrass-tinged finish. There is almost an Alsace-like personality to this Meursault, but I would like to see it develop more race by the time of bottling.",,RP (93-95)
1297,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Combes,"The 2013 Saint Aubin les Combes has another very expressive bouquet with hints of mango and overripe Satsumas combining nicely with the mineral component. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite refined, although it just eases off a little prematurely on the tapered finish. Otherwise I envisage this slipping down the throat with ease.",,RP (93-95)
1298,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet les Champ Gain has an attractive flinty, smoky bouquet, hints of apricot blossom coming through. The palate is nicely balanced, supple in the mouth, but just missing a little race and mineralite on the saline finish.",,RP (93-95)
1299,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"The 2013 Saint Aubin le Banc has an elegant bouquet with subtle fresh pear and brioche scents that are nicely defined, if not the most intense you will find in this vintage. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, quite pointed in the mouth, with a terse citric, iodine-tinged finish that would marry beautifully with seafood. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
1300,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Les Pucelles,"The debut 2013 Saint Aubin Pucelle comes from a new fermage courtesy of Pierre-Yves aunt (and he did ask for just socks for Christmas.) It has a waxy bouquet with light resinous scents that are nicely defined. The palate is crisp and tensile with sharp citric fruit, nice weight, but just needing to develop a little more mineralite on the finish. It will be interesting to see how this does in 2014 - I feel Pierre-Yves is just getting to know this vineyard.",,RP (93-95)
1301,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"The 2013 Bourgogne Chardonnay, which had been bottled already when I visited Pierre-Yves, has a light and pretty, floral bouquet rather than fruit-driven. The palate is crisp on the entry with sharp acidity and a sour lemon finish. Very elegant for a generic white Burgundy.",,RP (93-95)
1302,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières,"The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet les Enseigneres has a very perfumed bouquet with ripe mango and peachy notes that make it very approachable. Conversely, the palate is crisp on the entry with piercing acidity. Perhaps this is the one 2013 cru that I find a little shrill on the finish, ergo my lower score.",,RP (93-95)
1303,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Santenay 1er Cru La Comme,"The 2013 Santenay 1er Cru La Combe comes from grapes that have been purchased by Pierre-Yves since 2006. It has a delightful bouquet with hints of apricot blossom and peach, the palate very well balanced, slightly waxy in texture and perhaps not possessing the delineation on the finish that the aromatics deserve. This is just missing that ""je ne sais quoi.""",,RP (93-95)
1304,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Caillerets 2011 from Pierre-Yves Colin is very austere on the nose with hints of beeswax, dewy green apples and granite scents that are tightly coiled. The palate is clean and fresh with a prickle of lemongrass on the entry. The acidity is well judged and there is a cheeky touch of white peach on the detailed finish. Reserved now, but this will repay time in the cellar.",,RP (93-95)
1305,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru La Chatenière,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Saint Aubin 1er Cru la Chatenière 2011 from Pierre-Yves Colin did not quite perform at the level of a few months ago. Nevertheless, it has a very precise bouquet with fine minerality coming through with aeration, the oak giving it a nice lift. The palate is clean and precise with bitter lemon and orange rind, although I snipped away a couple of points by a little reduction on the finish. I am sure that with decanting it would have blown off and I would have awarded a higher score.",,RP (93-95)
1306,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru might turn out to be Pierre-Yves Colin’s finest achievement in 2012 – including the Chevalier-Montrachet. It already offers a very expressive and lively bouquet with ebullient aniseed scents soaring from the glass, all with super delineation. The palate is medium-bodied, vibrant with hints of lemongrass and ginger. This Batard is very intense and concentrated for what is habitually a reticent Grand Cru in its youth, while the finish soars away. This is a grand cru revving up on the starting line. Climb on board. 

Readers should check out my video taken with Pierre-Yves onwww.erobertparker.com, where he discusses his impression of the 2012 vintage. He is the prime example of a vigneron that might not possess his own vines, yet creates wines that surpass many of those who do. The bottom line is that volume was approximately 40% to 50% down compared to 2011 (apart from St. Aubin that was only 20% to 25% down.) Pierre-Yves explained that his 2012s displayed much higher acid levels compared to 2011 and opined that they will be shy at the beginning. He expressed the importance of not wishing to “push” the wines, so that he could stay true to what he feels is a more classic vintage in the mold of 2007 and 2010. Tasting through the complete set of 2012s, Pierre-Yves clearly had a firm grasp on the vintage and his wines were (again) a cut above the rest, from his generic white Burgundy to his clutch of grand crus.

1307,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a far more mild-mannered bouquet compared to the raucous Batard, but it is utterly regal and beautifully defined. It has a touch of sea spray and orange blossom that becomes more accentuated with aeration. The palate is taut and racy on the entry, then mellows and becomes a classy affair. Nothing outrageous or decadent, but finely focused with a long mineral-rich finish. If you want fireworks go for the Batard, for sophistication come to Chevalier – the Rolls Royce compared to the Aston Martin Batard.

1308,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrieres has a classy bouquet with that minerality brought immediately to the forefront. It is very well-defined and focused. The palate is very well-balanced with a lovely line of acidity cutting like a knife through butter across the swath of vibrant, citrus fruit before finishing again with feisty, spicy notes that urge you to take another sip. Very classy.

The palate is lively and energetic on the entry with a racy citric thread and a wonderful saline note on the persistent finish. There is great potential here.

The palate is very well-balanced with a slightly peppery opening. It is very well-balanced and demonstrates superb transparency and weightlessness, yet the finish is very intense with that marine character coming through.

1311,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2012 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru was inexplicably showing a little cloudiness in the glass. Still, the nose is beautifully defined, airy and pure with hints of limestone, creme fraiche and freshly sliced apple. The palate is very well-balanced – understated at first and then building in intensity in the mouth and yet, it does not quite deliver the complexity that I was anticipating after the ethereal nose – at least not yet! Give this several years in bottle to let it show what it can do.

The palate is well-balanced with a touch of orange and lemon rind on the terse entry. There is that saline note once again, lending the wine tension and a sense of dryness on the finish that is almost Alsace-like in style. Very fine.

This should be attractive once bottled, but the nose needs to settle down.

The palate is very well-balanced with a lively opening. There is still a strictness and linearity here, what Pierre-Yves feels is the leitmotif of the vintage, but it is already showing more depth and breadth on the saline finish when compared to the Champlots and it should reward three of four years in barrel.

1319,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Rully Cailloux,"The 2012 Rully Cailloux has crisp pear and Granny Smith apple scents on the refined bouquet. The palate is clean and fresh with a fine line of citric acidity. There is lovely balance here and a very precise finish that is pure class at this level. 

Readers should check out my video taken with Pierre-Yves onwww.erobertparker.com, where he discusses his impression of the 2012 vintage. He is the prime example of a vigneron that might not possess his own vines, yet creates wines that surpass many of those who do. The bottom line is that volume was approximately 40% to 50% down compared to 2011 (apart from St. Aubin that was only 20% to 25% down.) Pierre-Yves explained that his 2012s displayed much higher acid levels compared to 2011 and opined that they will be shy at the beginning. He expressed the importance of not wishing to “push” the wines, so that he could stay true to what he feels is a more classic vintage in the mold of 2007 and 2010.

1320,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2012 Meursault Narvaux is a pretty little thing on the nose with light limestone and Alpine stream scents. The palate displays good weight on the entry and the spicy-tinged fruit struck through with crisp acidity, though the finish dips just before the finish line. Fine.

1321,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"Similar to the village cru, the 2012 St. Aubin 1er Cru Champlots is reticent on the nose despite coaxing, offering only faint sea spray notes with aeration. The palate is more promising with very fine minerality on the stony entry. It is tightly wound and very Puligny-like with a long tail on the finish. Hopefully the aromatics will gain a little more vigor, so I would leave this for 12 to 18 months at least before broaching.

1322,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"The 2012 Bourgogne Chardonnay is the usual blend of two vineyards in Saint Aubin and Puligny. It has a very perfumed, quite floral bouquet with light apple blossom scents. The palate is clean and fresh with light malic fruit and a touch of white pepper to enliven what is a short finish. This is a crisp, lively little white Burgundy.

1323,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"The 2012 St. Aubin Le Bon is more reclusive on the nose at this early juncture and demands more coaxing than the Rully. There is a pleasant roundness and fullness on the entry, although it does not quite match the Rully in terms of the complexity and terroir expression on the finish. Perhaps this is one example where I prefer the 2011 over the 2012.

1324,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has an understated bouquet that demands coaxing from the glass, but with a little encouragement it gives up lovely nectarine and white peach scents. Still, the aromatics give out the message that it needs three or four years in bottle. The palate is very precise and wonderfully balanced, perfectly judged acidity and extremely well-focused. It has a vibrant, sorbet-fresh finish that simply dances about the mouth with merry abandon. This is exquisite and encapsulates everything a Chevalier-Montrachet should be. 

Following last issue’s “amuse bouche,” I could not miss an opportunity to visit Pierre-Yves at his winery in the village of Chassagne to take a look at his 2011s. “I like the 2011s because they give a lot of pleasure when they are young,” he said to me. “But I think they could age very well. The wines are on the ripe side – a bit like 2001 or maybe 2002. But I think it is a complete vintage. Personally, I prefer 2010 which is more on the mineral side, but the 2011s appeal to a wider audience, and in a way, bring people to Burgundy. When the customers come to the estate, they seem to have never heard about the 2011 vintage and so they do not know what to expect. But when they taste them they were quite easy to sell.” Pierre-Yves 2011s do not disappoint, mostly imbued with the delineation and poise we have come to expect from this top-tier producer who demonstrates that you do not necessarily have to own all your vines to create exceptional wines. We briefly discussed his move away from new oak and he admitted that perhaps during his initial vintages he was trying to impress. That is only natural. He has retreated from the cooperage to employ a minimal amount of new wood and things are about to change again. He had just taken delivery of two 11-hectolitre wooden troconic tanks that he will trial with the 2013 vintage, probably on one of the St. Aubin wines such as En Remilly. I cannot wait to taste the results. The Chassagne-Montrachets underwent a longer elevage than the St. Aubins and were bottled two months prior to my visit in July 2013.

1325,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrieres comes from the higher reaches of the climat. It has a wonderful bouquet reminiscent of Jean-Francois Coche’s 2005 Genevrieres, exhibiting enthralling delineation and a beguiling floral personality. The palate shimmers with vigor and race on the entry –  beautifully integrated oak, an engaging silver thread of acidity and a mineral-rich finish that is paradoxically both elegant and intense. There is a sense of completeness here. A top Meursault for the vintage and one of Pierre-Yves finest 2011s. Drink 2014-2025+

1326,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2011 Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a fabulous bouquet that is beautifully defined with hints of melted butter and almond flakes. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with lime zest and citrus peel. It is wonderfully focused with a precise, tender, mineral-rich finish. This sophisticated Batard should age with panache over the next two decades. Drink 2015-2030+

It has a precise bouquet with seamlessly integrated oak just lifting up those lime flower, apricot blossom and brioche scents. The palate has a fine line of acidity and wonderful focus: shimmering green lemon and white peach notes. They fan out toward the precise, mineral-laden finish. This is divine – at the right temperature of course!

1328,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chenevottes,"The bouquet on the 2011 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Chenevottes lies in stark contrast to the Ancegnieres: much more strict and linear, more Puligny in style with orange blossom and a sprig of lemon thyme. And I prefer the palate, which has superb balance and focus: holding everything back on the entry before motoring toward a vibrant, white peach, nectarine and pear-driven finish. It does not possess enormous persistency, but that does not really detract from a great 2011 white Burgundy.

The palate is crisp and taut on the entry, demonstrating a little more weight and penetration than the Genevrieres, with suggestions of toffee and even a dab of white chocolate on the long, tender finish. This just has a fabulous texture and will be fascinating to watch evolve. Drink 2015-2030.

1330,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"The 2011 St. Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly is a blend of three parcels averaging 50 years in age: 25-, 50- and 75-year-old vines, usually all picked on the same day determined by the 50-day parcel. It is initially more bashful on the nose than Pierre-Yves’s other Premier Crus, beckoning you in to fathom its mineral-laden scents dallying with peach skin and freshly sliced pear. The palate is extremely well-balanced and is more attacking than the nose with vivacious citrus fruit intertwined with lemongrass and dried apricot. It is harmonious on the finish, demonstrating fine weight in the mouth, if not quite the persistency that it may well develop with bottle age. Drink 2015-2020.

They are Pierre-Yves’s oldest and are usually the first to be picked around three days before others depending upon the season. It has an extrovert bouquet with captivating wild fennel and minty scents leaping up and down for attention. The palate has a slightly viscous, honeyed entry with a keen thread of acidity to keep it in balance. There is certainly good weight here: a powerful Puligny with a long fantail of white peach and a hint of passion fruit. This is very fine. Drink now-2022.

The palate is nicely balanced but does not quite have the verve I was expecting for such a propitious lieu-dit. It is very linear and precise, although it needs a little more character on the finish that is a little abrupt.

He had just taken delivery of two 11-hectolitre wooden troconic tanks that he will trial with the 2013 vintage, probably on one of the St. Aubin wines such as En Remilly. I cannot wait to taste the results. The Chassagne-Montrachets underwent a longer elevage than the St. Aubins and were bottled two months prior to my visit in July 2013.

1333,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"The 2011 St Aubin 1er Cru Champlots, has a lighter nose than the Le Banc comes from rocky limestone soils. Pierre-Yves mentioned that you can pick this at around 12 degrees at full ripeness. It is more precise and mineral-driven than Le Banc with perfumed Cornice pear and lime cordial. The palate is tightly wound on the entry and underpinned by bruised apple, pear and a pinch of ginger. It remains nicely focused toward the finish that is a little conservative, but nonetheless focused, and with a lovely twist of bitter lemon jumping out in the aftertaste. Drink now-2017.  

Following last issue’s “amuse bouche,” I could not miss an opportunity to visit Pierre-Yves at his winery in the village of Chassagne to take a look at his 2011s. “I like the 2011s because they give a lot of pleasure when they are young,” he said to me. “But I think they could age very well. The wines are on the ripe side – a bit like 2001 or maybe 2002. But I think it is a complete vintage. Personally, I prefer 2010 which is more on the mineral side, but the 2011s appeal to a wider audience, and in a way, bring people to Burgundy. When the customers come to the estate, they seem to have never heard about the 2011 vintage and so they do not know what to expect. But when they taste them they were quite easy to sell.” Pierre-Yves 2011s do not disappoint, mostly imbued with the delineation and poise we have come to expect from this top-tier producer who demonstrates that you do not necessarily have to own all your vines to create exceptional wines.

1334,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2011 Meursault Narvaux, which debuted with the 2004 vintage and whose vines are situated just above Genevrieres, offers a pretty apple-blossom and pear-skin bouquet that unfurls nicely in the glass, but never quite gets into fifth gear. The palate is crisp and vibrant on the entry with green apple and pear, racy acidity and a taut, rather pointed finish that will need a year in bottle just to “chill out.” Fine. Drink 2014-2018+

1335,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet Le Trézin,"The 2011 Puligny-Montrachet Le Trezin is a Village Cru from the top of the incline, perched above the Premier Crus. This has a comparatively simple bouquet that is conspicuous when tasting after Pierre-Yves superb Chassagne 2011s, with light malic notes and just a touch of nettle. The palate is quite structured on the entry with good grip, although it seems very linear from start to finish and it is missing a little length despite improving in the glass. This will constitute decent early drinking.

1336,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"Located not far from the lieu-dit of Frionnes and known for its freshness, the 2011 St. Aubin Village Le Banc was raised in 350-liter barrels, only one of which was new. Like all his St. Aubin 2011s, it was bottled in October 2012. It has quite a honeyed bouquet that is well-defined and vibrant with hints of peppermint emerging with encouragement. The palate is sweet on the entry and reminiscent of 2006 white Burgundies, open and generous with a hint of toffee apple toward the clean finish and subsequently lemon rind lingering on the aftertaste. This is one to “pop ‘n’ pour” over the next couple of years. Drink now-2015.

1337,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The outstanding Meursault Perrieres 2010 was a late-picked vintage that finished in late October. The mineralite really comes through on the nose here: very minimalist and Zen-like, not unlike a Meursault from Guy Roulot. Touches of fresh dewy green apple, kiwi fruit and lime emerge with aeration. The palate is fresh and lively on the entry with subtle apricot and peachy notes. It has crisp acidity, and is lively and focused on the sharp, tense finish. This is an excellent 2010: a riveting Meursault that expresses the terroir of Perrieres with great clarity. Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1338,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2008 Perrieres has superb aromatics, not far stylistically from the 2010 with expressive minerality: limestone, smoke and a touch of flint. There is real definition and clarity here: quintessential Perrieres. The palate is very well-balanced with a light blackberry leaf and citrus peel on the entry. There is good weight and harmony here with fresh apricot, Clementine and lemon on the composed finish that suggests several years in the cellar would be repaid in greater complexity. Drink 2016-2025.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1339,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2007 Perrieres has a much more exotic, generous bouquet than the 2008 with touches of honey, pear and vanilla-scented bouquet. The palate has a vibrant, lively entry – packed full of citric peel that pierces the Satsuma, fresh apricot and peach fruit. Still very youthful with wonderful balance and cohesion, it builds to a very precise, spicy finish with a long aftertaste. This is the first vintage in which I feel Pierre-Yves really captured the essence of Perrieres. Drink now-2020.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1340,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2006 has a bold, extravagant bouquet with dried honey, patisserie and vanilla scents that miss the delineation and precision of the 2007. The palate is nicely balanced and very pure – hints of lemon curd and crushed stone, although it is missing a little depth and persistency towards the finish. I would actually cellar this Meursault for another couple of years to see if it can muster something more. Here, it is overshadowed by the following vintage. Drink 2014-2018.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1341,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,A strange showing for the 2005 with toffee and Turkish Delight on the nose that seems more mature than it should. The palate is a little flabby on the entry and shows some volatility towards the finish. I do not think this is a representative bottle. Tasted December 2012.,,RP (90-92)
1342,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The Perrieres 2004 has a vibrant bouquet that leaps from the glass with a subtle note of aniseed in the background. It is pleasant, but to be truthful, does not reflect the essence of Perrieres with the same clarity as recent vintages. The palate is ripe and sweet on the entry with that minty note continuing in the mouth. There are notes of citrus lemon, orange zest and a cheeky touch of Benedictine, though it needed to demonstrate more complexity toward the finish. Drink now.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1343,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2003 Perrieres from Pierre-Yves has a delicate bouquet with touches of pine needles, candied orange peel and white peach – youthful but there is a slight dustiness from some cork taint. The palate is medium-bodied with lemon curd and white peach on the entry. It feels just a little subdued from the TCA, which neuters the finish. Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1344,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"There is a mulchy note on the nose of the 2002 Perrieres: earthy with touches of wild mushroom and truffle. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity. It is harmonious, but to be honest, not particularly complex especially when contrasted with more recent vintages. It offers more freshness than the 2003 although it retains fine tension after a decade. I would drink bottles now, although there are probably three or four more years of pleasure to be found. Drink now-2017.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1345,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot,"This was the first vintage made by Pierre-Yves. Showing maturity in its appearance, it has a light honeyed, earthy bouquet with smoke and mint. The palate is nicely balanced with a touch of ginger and rhubarb on the entry. It is composed and refined, demonstrating fine nuance and subtlety on the fresh finish. Back in 2003, Pierre Rovani spotted a star in the making and a wine whose drinking window opened until 2009, but on this showing, I would extend that window another few years. Drink now-2016.  Tasted December 2012.",,RP (90-92)
1346,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2010 Batard-Montrachet bursts from the glass with an exotic melange of intensely perfumed yellow stone fruits, flowers and spices. It boasts marvelous inner sweetness and layers of expressive fruit that seem to blossom endlessly in the glass, filling out the wine’s broad-shouldered frame all the way through to the huge, viscous finish. In 2010, the Batard is seamless, round and totally inviting. I want this wine. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.  

Pierre-Yves Colin and Caroline Morey follow their stunning 2009s with an equally compelling set of 2010s. The 2010s have deep site-specific signatures, rich fruit and plenty of acidity. Fans of this small, but increasingly high profile address will want to flock to these wines. Pierre Yves Colin started picking on September 22. Yields were down just 5-10%, which is pretty remarkable considering the vintage. It was a difficult vintage in the cellar, as malos were late and slow. When I visited last June, virtually all of the wines were still finishing their malos. With the exception of the St. Aubins, the 2010s spent about 18 months in barrel. The St. Aubins were bottled in November 2011. All of the other 2010s were bottled in April 2012. The 2011s, which I tasted from barrel, are very promising, so there is a lot to look forward to.

1347,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Weightless and pure, the 2010 Chevalier-Montrachet is utterly impeccable. Layers of sublime, ethereal, perfumed fruit appear to literally float from the glass as this feminine, gracious Burgundy seduces the heart, intellect and palate all at once. Subtle saline notes add freshness on the finish. The 2010 is polished and superbly refined from the very first taste. It is another breathtaking wine. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

1348,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Things get even better with the majestic 2010 Meursault Genevrieres. Initially rather buttoned up, the wine really only opens up on the mid-palate, where endless layers of explosive fruit emerge with no end. This is an intensely pointed, chiseled wine endowed with tons of richness and power. Hints of slate, crushed rocks and citrus are woven together on the pointed, utterly brilliant finish.

It boasts tons of richness and power, yet all of those elements are buffered by the wine’s structure and acidity. Simply put, everything is in the right place. There is an element of pure unbridled energy and sheer tension that gives the Charmes its explosiveness and compelling personality. This is a great showing. I can’t wait to taste the Charmes in another year or two. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

When I visited last June, virtually all of the wines were still finishing their malos. With the exception of the St. Aubins, the 2010s spent about 18 months in barrel. The St. Aubins were bottled in November 2011. All of the other 2010s were bottled in April 2012. The 2011s, which I tasted from barrel, are very promising, so there is a lot to look forward to.

1355,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2010 Puligny-Montrachet Champs Gain is pretty, round and harmonious. It is another of the more open 2010s here, but has a level of textural finesse and sheer elegance that is missing from some of the other more approachable wines. A pretty, spiced note lingers on the finish. Anticipated maturity: 2012+.

1356,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chenevottes,"The 2010 Chassagne-Montrachet Chenevottes has more than enough fruit and body to fill out its considerable frame. The overall impression is one of exquisite balance, tension and finesse. Simply put, all the elements are in the right place. A soft, saline-infused fruit caresses the palate on the finish.

1357,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières,"Colin-Morey’s 2010 Chassagne-Montrachet Les Ancegnières captures the best elements of the vintage. It is at once intense yet weightless, with a cool minerality that is presently keeping the fruit from being fully expressive. In another year or two the Ancegnières should begin to blossom.

1359,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly,"Once again, the 2010 St. Aubin En Remilly is strikingly beautiful and precise. Flint, wet stones, white flowers and bright fruit are some of the many notes that emerge from the glass. Elements of transparency and weightlessness make the En Remilly a sort of poor man’s Meursault Genevrieres . Year after year, this has been one of the very finest white Burgundies in its price range, not to mention a wine that often challenges offerings from more prestigious appellations. En Remilly remains one of the Colin-Morey signatures. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.

1361,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"The 2010 St. Aubin Les Champlots is more overt and generous than the Remilly.

Readers who appreciate the more generous, open side of Burgundy and the 2010 vintage will adore the Champlots. Anticipated maturity:  2013+.

Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey is one of Burgundy’s most exciting young producers. Colin-Morey works with six hectares of vineyards, three of which are estate owned, while the rest are sources of purchased fruit. According to Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey, the key to 2009 was picking early. The harvest started on the September 4. Colin-Morey did a long, slow press, with no batonnage once the wines were in barrel, all with the aim of preserving as much freshness as possible given the natural ripeness of the fruit. Roughly 80% of the wines were aged in 350-liter barrels, larger than the norm in Burgundy. Colin-Morey finished bottling the 2009s in April 2011. Colin-Morey told me he wasn’t enthused about the 2009s at first, but now thinks the wines have enough freshness to age well.

This is a decidedly elegant Corton-Charlemagne that impresses for its elegance. It is cool, inward and precise from start to finish. Colin-Morey works with two parcels, one on the Aloxe side, the other on the Pernand side. Both were harvested on the same day, vinified together and aged in Chassin barrels, one of them new. Today the oak is a bit prominent, but it should integrate in another few years. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.

1375,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Colin 2007 Batard-Montrachet -- from centrally-located 50 year old vines – positively crawls up the nostrils in its intense amalgam of pit fruit distillate; smoky black tea; lemon and grapefruit; and heliotrope. Citrus traverses the palate like an electric current, enlivening a dense concentrate of lightly caramelized peach, nut paste, and chalk, that is almost custard-like in texture. This finishes with tremendous force and grip. Like the corresponding Corton-Charlemagne, I have the feeling that it could exhibit something of a split personality on any given day in its youth. Today, all cylinders are certainly firing – and nearly in sync – even if the result is more formidable than loveable. Give this a few years – if you are lucky enough to acquire some bottles – and I would not be surprised to see it reward a decade of attention.

Pierre-Yves Colin – who openly pledges allegiance to Riesling virtues – does more than just talk the talk of achieving ripe fruit at low levels of potential alcohol. Finished alcohols in his collection – after half a percent or so of chaptalization – range from a (for modern times almost astonishing) 11.75% up to 12.75%. “I really can’t say,” he confesses, “why so many growers were getting fruit of 12.5% or more potential alcohol already at the end of August,” ten days before Colin even began picking, but he can say he doubts their fruit tasted ripe then! Half of the acreage he accesses is in Saint-Aubin – naturally conducive to later ripening – and was not picked until past mid-September this year. Colin believes in minimal settling, by gravity, and retaining lots of lees, but not in actively working them; favors rapid pressing, and 350- (one-third new) over 225-liter barrels; and welcomes late and protracted malo-lactic conversions – although this vintage's malos were completed by the following June. He bottled his Saint-Aubin crus at just over a year; his other premier crus this past March; and the grands crus (of which I was unfortunately unable to taste the Chevalier-Montrachet) in May, sealing them all with wax, in the belief that this will provide extra protection against harmful oxygen ingress.

1376,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Comprising (like last year’s rendition) two barrels’ worth from each of the appellations two communes and exposures, picked same day and married in the press, Colin’s 2007 Corton-Charlemagne smells pungently of lavender, heliotrope, white pepper, ginger, and crushed stone. Coming onto the palate with an almost austere combination of pungency, chalkiness, and textural firmness, its bright lemon and white peach suffice to inject a note of sheer juiciness that  it a long, invigorating finish largely rises to the challenge of so much pungency and stoniness. This should become richer – but hopefully preserve its brash intensity – with a few years in the bottle and may well merit following for a decade or more. And in fact, it’s another of those Colin 2007s about which I wonder whether if would have shown better simply on another day.

1377,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault Les Narvaux,"Grapefruit, peach, honeysuckle, and almond extract in the nose of Colin’s 2007 Meursault Narvaux leads to a dynamic palate interchange of clear, bright citrus and peach with salt, chalk, and bitter zest and cyanic notes. This is an impeccably balanced, buoyant, but high-strung example of Narvaux nerveaux whose penetrating, vibratory finish will leave you invigorated and intrigued by the thought of repeated visits over the next 5-6 years.

1378,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"Colin’s 2007 Chassagne-Montrachet Caillerets offers a fascinating contrast and dynamic counterpoint of enervating brightness with satiny, borderline creamy texture; and of high-toned pit fruit and herbal distillates, luscious citrus, white peach, and liquid honeysuckle perfume with chalky, smoky mineral (and lees- and oak-inflected) elements. Superbly refined, with its rich fruit utterly transparent to myriad mineral and floral and herbal nuances, this finishes with a fine alliance of refreshment and complexity. Look for it to be even more satisfying in a couple of years, and to justify 6-8 total in bottle.

This wine's overt, adamant mineral expression, when combined with its pungent, bitter elements and almost sharp esters, makes for a formidably concentrated, energizing, if slightly dissonant finish. Depending on how this wine sorts its self out – I suspect I caught it on a slightly inharmonious day – there is almost certainly potential for greatness and 6 or more years’ aging here, and it will be well worth revisiting.

1380,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru La Chatenière,"From two roughly 40 year old parcels, Colin’s 2007 Saint-Aubin Les Chateniere comes from a vineyard in which mother chalk lies a mere ten centimeters below the surface. The result is wine to which he accurately ascribes “purity and rectitude,” yet with a quite different expression of things mineral than accrued to the Champlots. Pure pear and white peach aromas and juicy fruit essences are tinged with lemon zest, white pepper, and cardamom. Silken and subtly oily in texture, with underlying suggestions of peach kernel, peat, and sea salt, this finishes invigoratingly and positively pulling at the salivary glands. A crystal clear, refreshing, and uplifting Saint-Aubin, it will probably be worth following for 4-5 years.

1381,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Colin’s 2007 Meursault Charmes smells of candied orange zest, vanilla, honey, and subtly caramelized apple, all of which seem to promise an unusually advanced degree of phenolic maturity for the vintage, not to mention for this collection. This harbors a dustiness allied to zesty pungency that seems to hover halfway between chalky mineral expression and a hint of botrytis, and comes out prominently in the finish. The upshot of all this is a wine that doesn’t reflect the name of its appellation; seems to over-promise on its effusively ripe nose; and then come up slightly austere in the back end. A sense of lees-enriched creaminess helps smooth the joint between fruit and stone a bit, and readers should be in no doubt that this is highly-concentrated material. We opened two bottles to confirm my impressions, but this deserves re-visiting.

Lusciously-fruited, it displays an oily richness of texture yet at the same time an overtly chalky undertone that emerges to increasing prominence – along with fruit pit bitterness – in a finish of formidable fixity. This certainly far less charming than the Ancegnieres, but it will be very interesting to see what a few years bring, and I suspect this concentrated and energetic Chassagne will prove itself worth following for at least 5-7 years.

This forward wine might well continue to perform well for 4-5 years.  

Pierre-Yves Colin – who openly pledges allegiance to Riesling virtues – does more than just talk the talk of achieving ripe fruit at low levels of potential alcohol. Finished alcohols in his collection – after half a percent or so of chaptalization – range from a (for modern times almost astonishing) 11.75% up to 12.75%. “I really can’t say,” he confesses, “why so many growers were getting fruit of 12.5% or more potential alcohol already at the end of August,” ten days before Colin even began picking, but he can say he doubts their fruit tasted ripe then! Half of the acreage he accesses is in Saint-Aubin – naturally conducive to later ripening – and was not picked until past mid-September this year. Colin believes in minimal settling, by gravity, and retaining lots of lees, but not in actively working them; favors rapid pressing, and 350- (one-third new) over 225-liter barrels; and welcomes late and protracted malo-lactic conversions – although this vintage's malos were completed by the following June. He bottled his Saint-Aubin crus at just over a year; his other premier crus this past March; and the grands crus (of which I was unfortunately unable to taste the Chevalier-Montrachet) in May, sealing them all with wax, in the belief that this will provide extra protection against harmful oxygen ingress.

For myriad further details on this relatively new estate and its rapidly-growing family of wines – nearly half of which are from contract fruit – readers are urged to consult my report in issue 180, where – having up until then not seen a label – I inadvertently left-off the “-Morey” from the winery name

1386,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Champlots,"Colin’s 2007 Saint-Aubin Champlots offers a truly mysterious collection of hard-to-describe mineral and animal scents and flavors, with analogies to the chicken stock, oyster shell, iodine, seaweed, and crustacean reduction more often found in Chablis, but also with briny, sweaty elements that will not represent everyone’s cup of white Burgundy. Those who consider it a promising sign to ask “how could this possibly come from grapes?” will be caught up in the intrigue. Others might simply find this a formidably concentrated yet spare (if vaguely satin-textured) wine short on primary fruit. To its implacable finish, citrus zest and cyanic fruit pip notes only add a further note of austerity. How it might age I can hardly guess, but hope to find out.

1387,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Saint-Aubin Le Banc,"Colin’s 2007 Saint-Aubin Le Banc – from well into the hills west of that village – offers fusil and crushed stone notes mingled with lime and grapefruit in the nose, reminding me (as does the corresponding Bourgogne) of Kimmeridgian, Chablis character. Bright and refreshingly citric on the palate with persistent, salt, chalk, mineral oil, almond, and pistachio, smoke and fruit pit adjuncts, this finishes with invigorating juiciness that helps keep its lean texture and brightness from becoming austere. The empty glass seems somehow to reek of things mineral. I would plan to enjoy this highly distinctive wine over the next couple of years, though there is really no way of telling until a track record emerges for these wines.

1388,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"From old vines he owns in Saint-Aubin and Puligny, Colin’s rather Chablis-like 2007 Bourgogne smells of herbs and lemon; is bracing but not overly spare on the palate; and leaves behind a surprisingly long trail of chalk and iodine.

1389,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Lime, grapefruit, green tea, lemon oil, and chalk dust on the nose mark Colin’s 2006 Chevalier-Montrachet as inhabiting a much cooler and more refreshing realm than his corresponding Batard. Rather than enveloping richness, this delivers a long-lined, refined, subtly yet penetratingly insistent personality. Having not finished its malo-lactic transformation until well after the 2007 harvest, this Chevalier was correspondingly in need of time when I tasted it; speaking of which, it will probably have a felicitous, ten year future.

In 2005, Marc Colin presided over a division of his estate among his four children, and Pierre-Yves Colin – who had worked at his father’s estate since 1995 and had been making a few barrels of his own from purchased grapes since 2001 – elected to strike out on his own, bottling in his inaugural vintage of 2006 a considerable range of wines in small lots – not all of which I tasted – both from his inheritance in Saint-Aubin and Chassagne and from (presently 30%) contract fruit (largely picked by picked by his own team) in Meursault and Puligny. (He employs the same label for both groups of wines). Colin is one of Burgundy’s unabashed admirers of Riesling, and while he believes in a long elevage for his wines, he does not stir their lees (yet his wines are flatteringly creamy in texture) and professes unconcern as to whether his wines complete malolactic fermentation. (Although I taste no indication that any of these 2006s failed to complete their malo, there is no question most are noticeably bright.) Colin overwhelmingly favors 350-liter barrels over standard (228- or 225-liter) barriques for the freshness and clarity he believes they confer, and even his less prestigious appellations receive 30-50% new wood. Like many in Chassagne, he felt comfortable delaying the commencement of his 2006 harvest until September 21, yet most of the resultant wines hover on either side of 13% alcohol.

1390,Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Colin 2006 Batard-Montrachet (from 50 year old vines) is gorgeously and exotically scented with very ripe white peach, litchi, and marzipan. Deeply rich and creamy this finishes with mouth-coating tenacity of peach, nut paste, chalk, and white pepper. It will no doubt stand up to at least 6-8 years in the cellar, but it is undeniably seductive even before bottling, and likely to remain so.

Quite broad and creamy for its appellation, this nevertheless does not lack for insistent refreshment and crushed stone minerality, lingering with an authoritative sense of grand cru length and refinement, and promising at least 7-9 years of cellar potential.

Positively dripping with lily and honeysuckle perfume along with fresh apricot, and with both wafting floral character and piquant toasted nuttiness in its layered, long finish, this superb Saint-Aubin and outstanding value while there is no track record here gives every indication of being worth cellaring for at least 4-6 years.

Inner-mouth floral notes and nougat-like nutty richness lend a suggestion of sweetness, and this wine’s texture is opulently creamy, almost doughy; yet, an uncanny sense of clarity, purity, and refreshment is preserved along with decidedly alkaline and wet stone mineral character, all of which curb the flamboyant tendencies on exhibit in this long-finishing wine that should merit 5-7 years of cellaring.

(He employs the same label for both groups of wines). Colin is one of Burgundy’s unabashed admirers of Riesling, and while he believes in a long elevage for his wines, he does not stir their lees (yet his wines are flatteringly creamy in texture) and professes unconcern as to whether his wines complete malolactic fermentation. (Although I taste no indication that any of these 2006s failed to complete their malo, there is no question most are noticeably bright.) Colin overwhelmingly favors 350-liter barrels over standard (228- or 225-liter) barriques for the freshness and clarity he believes they confer, and even his less prestigious appellations receive 30-50% new wood. Like many in Chassagne, he felt comfortable delaying the commencement of his 2006 harvest until September 21, yet most of the resultant wines hover on either side of 13% alcohol.

Talk about garage wines... there are only between 265 and 275 bottles of each of these wines. Pierre-Yves Colin has begun this microscopic negociant firm “to do all the crazy things I cannot do at the family estate, here I can take risks that I’d never do with my family’s wines. In addition, here I’m working with tiny quantities, so hand bottling is easy.” Colin’s modus operandi is to place barrels at the estates of vignerons whose wines he appreciates at harvest, then, if he likes the result, he picks them up to finish their elevage. In 2001 he dropped 8 barrels off and purchased only six, the other two growers kept the barrels and the wine. Batonnage takes place once a week and the wines are fined but not filtered, then bottled by hand. Interestingly, I found a minty, pine-cone characteristic in almost all of these wines (the Chevalier was the exception), something I haven’t encountered in Burgundy before.

For those interested in Burgundian minutia, the “Morey” in the name of this company is due to the fact that Pierre-Yves Colin is married to the daughter of Jean-Marc Morey of Chassagne-Montrachet.

Medium-bodied, big, suave, sexy, and powerful, it is an oily-textured behemoth, particularly given the fact that its terroir has the propensity for lace-like wines.

Talk about garage wines... there are only between 265 and 275 bottles of each of these wines. Pierre-Yves Colin has begun this microscopic negociant firm “to do all the crazy things I cannot do at the family estate, here I can take risks that I’d never do with my family’s wines. In addition, here I’m working with tiny quantities, so hand bottling is easy.” Colin’s modus operandi is to place barrels at the estates of vignerons whose wines he appreciates at harvest, then, if he likes the result, he picks them up to finish their elevage. In 2001 he dropped 8 barrels off and purchased only six, the other two growers kept the barrels and the wine. Batonnage takes place once a week and the wines are fined but not filtered, then bottled by hand. Interestingly, I found a minty, pine-cone characteristic in almost all of these wines (the Chevalier was the exception), something I haven’t encountered in Burgundy before.

For those interested in Burgundian minutia, the “Morey” in the name of this company is due to the fact that Pierre-Yves Colin is married to the daughter of Jean-Marc Morey of Chassagne-Montrachet.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and richly tannic, with a firm, somewhat blocky profile that is quintessentially Clos Vougeot, displaying excellent concentration in a year where frosted vines tended to yield generously.

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and chewy, with a tense, tight-knit core that contrasts with most of Lachaux's other 2017s, and it will demand correspondingly longer in bottle to reach its peak.",,RP (93-95)
1439,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès,"Bursting with aromas of red berries, candied peel, peony and rose petal, the 2017 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a deep, layered core, excellent volume and amplitude and a chassis of fine-grained, chalky tannins that only makes itself felt on the fragrant finish.

1444,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is youthfully reticent, but the wine unwinds in the glass to reveal a stunning bouquet of violet, rose petal, dark berries, baking chocolate, candied peel and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a deep, multidimensional but tight-knit core that largely conceals its rich tannic chassis, bright balancing acids and a long, fragrant finish. This is a beautiful wine, built for the long haul, and it numbers among the best bottles that the young Charles Lachaux has produced to date.",,RP (93-95)
1445,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru reveals exceptional potential and ranks as one of the most exciting wines Charles Lachaux has produced to date, wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, dark chocolate, grilled game bird, peony and mossy soil.

1446,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"Lachaux lost half of his crop in this vineyard to frost, but the 2016 Echezeaux Grand Cru is superb, offering up a deep bouquet of wild berries, orange rind and mossy soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and expansive, with a firm, tight-knit core, excellent concentration and a rich chassis of structuring tannin, underpinned by vibrant acids.

1448,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Strikingly expressive and fragrant aromas of violets, rose petals, spices and red cherries introduce the 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots, a medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny wine, its melting tannins entirely concealed in a succulent core of fruit, concluding with a long, saline finish. It's one of the more open, immediate premiers crus in the cellar. Lachaux observes that he wants people who open his bottles to be driven to drink them by “the desire to discover in the mouth what you have on the nose,” and with this wine, he has very much succeeded.",,RP (93-95)
1449,Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Corvées Pagets,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Corvées Pagets is also quite youthfully reticent at this stage, unwinding in the glass with a lovely bouquet of raspberries, dark chocolate, candied peel and rose petal.

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and sappy, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannin, bright acids, good depth and length, and a solid core. Like most of Charles Lachaux's 2015s, this is shutting down, but it should be exceptional in the fullness of time. This is produced from a parcel in Rouges du Bas: one of the steeper, higher-altitude parts of Echézeaux, where the soil is thinner and the wines tend to be more tensile.",,RP (93-95)

It's an elegant wine that is far from the stereotype of Nuits-Saint-Georges.",,RP (93-95)
1474,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières offers up aromas of cherries, raspberries, potpourri, blood orange and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, supple and sapid palate that's richer and more layered than the domaine's regular Vosne bottling, with succulent acids and fragrant finish.",,RP (93-95)
1475,Roagna,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village,"The 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges Village offers up aromas of red cherry, spices, raw cocoa and rich soil, followed by a supple, open-knit palate that's juicy and fragrant, framed by melting tannins.",,RP (93-95)
1476,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes offers up pretty aromas of rose petals, cherries, dried flowers and cinnamon, followed by a medium to full-bodied palate, with firm, chewy structuring tannins that were rather prominent when I tasted the wine. Let's see how it shows from the bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1477,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée Village offers up aromas of raspberries, plum and smoked duck, followed by a medium to full-bodied, ample and open-knit palate that's framed by chalky tannins.",,RP (93-95)
1478,Roagna,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is youthfully reticent, but the wine unwinds in the glass to reveal a stunning bouquet of violet, rose petal, dark berries, baking chocolate, candied peel and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a deep, multidimensional but tight-knit core that largely conceals its rich tannic chassis, bright balancing acids and a long, fragrant finish. This is a beautiful wine, built for the long haul, and it numbers among the best bottles that the young Charles Lachaux has produced to date.",,RP (93-95)
1479,Roagna,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru reveals exceptional potential and ranks as one of the most exciting wines Charles Lachaux has produced to date, wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, dark chocolate, grilled game bird, peony and mossy soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with a dense, layered core, tangy balancing acids and a long, vibrant finish. It's currently quite reserved and will demand some patience.",,RP (93-95)
1480,Roagna,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"Lachaux lost half of his crop in this vineyard to frost, but the 2016 Echezeaux Grand Cru is superb, offering up a deep bouquet of wild berries, orange rind and mossy soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and expansive, with a firm, tight-knit core, excellent concentration and a rich chassis of structuring tannin, underpinned by vibrant acids. This will need and reward time, but it's one of the finest renditions of this site to date from Charles Lachaux.",,RP (93-95)
1481,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots is one of the highlights of the range this year, offering up a complex bouquet of rose petal, Asian spices, wild berries and sapid bass notes of grilled game bird and smoke. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and layered, with satiny structuring tannins, an intensely concentrated core of fruit and a long, resonant finish. This is a powerful, complete and tight-knit Suchots that will really reward bottle age.",,RP (93-95)
1482,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Strikingly expressive and fragrant aromas of violets, rose petals, spices and red cherries introduce the 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots, a medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny wine, its melting tannins entirely concealed in a succulent core of fruit, concluding with a long, saline finish. It's one of the more open, immediate premiers crus in the cellar. Lachaux observes that he wants people who open his bottles to be driven to drink them by “the desire to discover in the mouth what you have on the nose,” and with this wine, he has very much succeeded.",,RP (93-95)
1483,Roagna,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Corvées Pagets,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Corvées Pagets is also quite youthfully reticent at this stage, unwinding in the glass with a lovely bouquet of raspberries, dark chocolate, candied peel and rose petal. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with considerable amplitude and dimension, its fine but chewy structuring tannins largely concealed by a vibrant core of fruit.",,RP (93-95)
1484,Roagna,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès,"The 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès is shutting down, opening reluctantly in the glass to reveal aromas of red berries, grilled meat and warm spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny but dense, with a deep, concentrated core and chalky structuring tannins. This will need more time than the comparatively precocious 2017 rendition.",,RP (93-95)
1485,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières is very fine indeed, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, rich spices, grilled game and dried flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with an ample, layered mid-palate, succulent acids and a long finish.",,RP (93-95)
1486,Roagna,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Village is a lovely wine, wafting from the glass with notes of raspberries, cherries, rose hips and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with more depth, concentration and length than the 2017 rendition, while avoiding any of the imbalances that mark some of the Chambolle wines produced in this frost-ravaged vintage.",,RP (93-95)
1487,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée Village,"Tighter-knit and more reticent than the 2017 rendition, the 2016 Vosne-Romanée Village exhibits notes of dark plummy fruit, blood orange, grilled game and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, firm and chewy, with juicy acids and good depth and length. I suspect that this cuvée will gain immensely over the coming years as Charles Lachaux's vineyard work makes more and more of a difference.",,RP (93-95)
1488,Roagna,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges Village displays attractive aromas of dark berries, grilled game, rich soil and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with tangy acids and lots of fine-grained but youthfully chewy structure. Above all, the wine's liveliness and energy distinguish it.",,RP (93-95)
1489,Roagna,Bourgogne Pinot Fin,"The 2016 Bourgogne Pinot Fin unfurls in the glass with aromas of berries, currants, raw cocoa and licorice. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and succulent, with tangier acids and a tighter-knit core than the 2017 rendition, concluding with a long, fragrant finish. The cuvée's name indicates its provenance from superior selections of Pinot Noir that produce small berries and open clusters.",,RP (93-95)
1490,Roagna,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"Offering up notes of baking chocolate, dark berries and flowers, the 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes is medium to full-bodied, ample and expansive, framed by firm, chewy tannins that will need some time in bottle to resolve. It's one of the more rustic wines in the cellar this year.",,RP (93-95)
1491,Roagna,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is lovely, revealing a beautifully pure bouquet of cassis, plum, clove, violets, rose petal and spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and complete, with supple, fine-grained tannins and excellent depth and dimension, with the most flesh on its bones of all the domaine's grands crus. The inherent elegance of Romanée-Saint-Vivant really plays into Charles Lachaux's hands.",,RP (93-95)
1492,Roagna,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is one of the more aromatically reticent wines in the range, opening in the glass with notes of coniferous forest floor, raspberry and currant leaf. On the palate, the wine is supple, silky and expansive, with a deep and sapid core of fruit, bright acids, and fine-grained, chalky tannins which assert themselves on the finish. This will need time, but the raw materials are promising.",,RP (93-95)
1493,Roagna,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 2015 Echezeaux Grand Cru is very pretty, opening in the glass with notes of sweet cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, rose and spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and sappy, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannin, bright acids, good depth and length, and a solid core. Like most of Charles Lachaux's 2015s, this is shutting down, but it should be exceptional in the fullness of time. This is produced from a parcel in Rouges du Bas: one of the steeper, higher-altitude parts of Echézeaux, where the soil is thinner and the wines tend to be more tensile.",,RP (93-95)
1494,Roagna,Barolo Riserva Pira,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots wafts from the glass with brooding aromas of plums, wild berries, rich spice, orange rind and subtle game bird. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and deep, with a cool core of fruit, sappy acids and an abundance of fine-grained tannic structure. A very promising Suchots which will need time.",,RP 94+
1495,Roagna,Barbaresco Crichët Pajé,"I was lucky to taste the Roagna 2005 Barbaresco Crichët Pajé from magnum. This wine will take you on quite a long journey with a multifaceted bouquet that has moved squarely into tertiary definition. Dried fruit and dark currant appear, but most of the experience relates to aged tones of rusty nail, crushed flint, dried herb, rosemary essence and camphor ash. There are hints of dusty white pepper and more of that metallic iron ore. You feel the power of Nebbiolo on the close. This vintage of Crichët Pajé has never been previously reviewed in this publication, and it's terrific to see how well the wine is holding up.",,RP 94+
1496,Roagna,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2018 Dolcetto d'Alba sees its fruit sourced from two sites in Barbaresco. It comes from the lower part of the Pajè vineyard and from the tail end of Asili hill. There is a lot of fruit purity here, all presented with naked transparency. This wine sees a very long 100 days of skin maceration time, intended to draw out the tannins from the seeds of the Dolcetto grape. Dark cherry, cassis and blackberry emerge from the bouquet. The tannic firmness is subtle and integrated within the fresh primary fruit. Production is 900 cases with 12 bottles in each.",,RP 94+
1497,Roagna,Derthona Montemarzino,"The Roagna 2017 Derthona Montemarzino is a pure expression of the Timorasso grape, heralded as one of the most exciting combinations of grape and emerging territory to be found in Italy in recent years. From a hot vintage, this wine is abundant, rich and generous. It shows a luminous golden color with a combination of sweet and tart aromas. For example, there is Calabrian bergamot, orchard fruit and yellow rose. There are dustings of mineral and petrol like you might find in a Riesling. Fruit comes from a one-hectare plot in the Colli Tortonesi with very rocky soils at 400 meters above sea level. This wine has been produced since 2014 thanks to land that was acquired by one cousin from another cousin. Some 250 12-bottle cases were produced.",,RP 94+
1498,Roagna,Langhe Solea,"This is a fascinating wine made with mostly Chardonnay (75%) and a smaller part Nebbiolo fermented off the skins as a white wine. Both grapes come from the Pira cru in Castiglione Falletto. The Roagna 2017 Langhe Solea opens to a bright off-gold color with warm-vintage aromas of ripe peach, cantaloupe melon and preserved lemon. There are some sweet aromas of candied almond and butterscotch as well. This is a mid-weight wine with extra tannic grip and power thanks to the Nebbiolo in the blend. You'd do well to pair it with a fatty fish such as salmon or grilled swordfish steak. Some 225 cases (of 12 bottles each) were released.",,RP 94+
1499,Roagna,Barbaresco Montefico Vecchie Viti,"You can almost feel that inner engine revving as this wine opens in the glass. The Roagna 2014 Barbaresco Montefico Vecchie Viti is perhaps the most focused and structured in this series. The Montefico vineyard in Barbaresco is characterized by calcareous clay soils with gray and blue marl. The vines are more than 90 years old, and this site has been farmed by the Roagna family since 1929. Montefico ripens last, allowing the grapes to benefit from long phenolic maturity. Thanks to these various factors, the bouquet is packed with plum, dark cherry, blue flower, campfire smoke and cured tobacco. There is a point of fleeting sweetness on the close followed by rich fiber and lasting spice or balsam herb. Those flavors linger on the palate for an extremely long time. A mere 1,195 bottles were produced.",,RP 94+
1500,Roagna,Barbaresco Asili Vecchie Viti,"The jump up in aromatic intensity is incredible once you start tasting from Roagna's line of Vecchie Vite, or old-vine wines. The 2014 Barbaresco Asili Vecchie Viti is a soft and enormously supple expression that shows beautifully integrated tannins, fruit and acidity. There is a note of sweet summer cherry that you notice first, duly followed by wild rose, candied orange peel and crushed stone. Fruit is drawn from a quarter-hectare site that has been farmed by the Roagna family since 1961, and the vines are more than 80 years old. The fruit is slightly more concentrated here, as is expected of old vines, and so is the acidity. Beautiful menthol notes add to that balanced freshness. The production numbers are very precious with only 1,200 bottles made.",,RP 94+
1501,Roagna,Barbaresco Pajè Vecchie Viti,"From a vineyard site measuring only half a hectare in size, the 2013 Barbaresco Pajè Vecchie Viti is marked by the strongest structural fiber when compared to Roagna's other old-vine wines from Barbaresco. This wine emerges from the glass with great aromatic precision, showing notes of cola, balsam and medicinal herb followed by plummy dark fruit. The effect is elegant and refined. The wine's tannic threshold measures right up there with Nebbiolo from Barolo, and this point is made at a tasting such as this by a producer who makes so many single-vineyard expressions from both appellations. In terms of its cellar aging potential, I'd put my money on Pajè for the slowest evolution and longest aging future.",,RP 95
1502,Roagna,Barolo del Comune di Barolo,"This is a new wine from the Roagna estate with properties in both Barolo and Barbaresco. The 2013 Barolo del Comune di Barolo comes from a tiny, tiny vineyard parcel measuring a mere .017 hectare with 50-year-old vines. Only 1,000 bottles were produced. Luca Roagna tells me that rather than a vineyard, it’s more like a house garden. The property is technically located in the Terlo cru, but because this particular parcel embraces the characteristics of neighboring Rivera and Le Coste, it was decided that the wine would be labeled as being from the greater Barolo township, rather than any one specific vineyard. This Barolo (like Roagna’s other wines) undergoes a very long maceration time and is fermented in large oak casks. This Barolo is beautifully and elegantly downplayed with fine aromas of black fruit, tar, licorice and forest floor. The quality of the tannins is very interesting, showing a very long, direct and silky finish.",,RP 95
1503,Roagna,Barbaresco Pajè,"The Pajè vineyard is among the most calcareous in terms of soil composition within the entire Barbaresco appellation. The vines are 50 years old, and those six years of barrel and bottle aging are absolutely necessary. This plot is a little under two hectares in size, and this site has been in family hands since 1953. In fact, Roagna is releasing all its expressions from 2013 at the same time. Thanks in part to the relative youth of the vines (young I suppose only by Roagna standards), the 2013 Barbaresco Pajè's aromas are large in scale and generally more fleshed out. The tannins are also a bit more dry or astringent. The wine shows deep contrasts between the sweet nature of the bouquet and the very sharp nature of the mouthfeel.",,RP 95
1504,Roagna,Barbera d'Alba,"The 2013 Barbera d'Alba sees fruit sourced exclusively from the Pira vineyard. Part of the vineyard was planted in faraway 1937, and another part in 1990, so the wine’s complexity and finesse is due to many factors, including the mixed ages of the vines. Roagna holds the wine back for five years before its commercial release. It is partially aged in oak (for two and a half years) and cement before the final wine is assembled and put back into cement for a final stage of integration and rest. This vintage was bottled in August 2018. The intent with this wine is to maintain the freshness of the vintage and to avoid big alcohol. As a result, you get fine and delicate blackberry aromas followed by medium structure, soft tannins and crisp berry intensity, and all these elements are beautifully played off one another.",,RP 95
1505,Roagna,Barbaresco Crichët Pajé,"The iconic 2010 Barbaresco Crichët Pajé doesn’t have Roagna’s name on the front label (other than a signature in script). Instead, the wine is recognized by its artwork featuring an image of workers on a labor strike with some political meaning. Luca Roagna’s grandfather bought these vines in 1953, and the first official vintage made was 1978 (even though a handful of experimental 1977 bottles may conceivably be spotted once in a blue moon). Most of the vines today are 80 years old. Luca’s father wanted to create a revolutionary wine (hence the political artwork on the font label) that would represent a break from classic Barbaresco. The idea was to create a Barbaresco designed for long cellar aging, just like its nearby cousin, Barolo. Indeed, the first thing you notice about this expression from 2010 is that the tannic structure needs more time to soften. That’s remarkable given that this wine has already completed anywhere from eight to ten (depending on the vintage) years of barrel aging. Crichët Pajé is not an officially recognized MGA cru; however, it is a single vineyard (measuring about half a hectare) planted on softly rolling hills that form an enclosed little amphitheater.",,RP 95
1506,Roagna,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2011 Dolcetto d-Alba delivers plenty of varietal character in an old-fashioned, traditional style that is appealing. Dark blue and black fruits, violets, spices and tar flow through to the finish. Hints of reduction that are typical of Dolcetto remain, so readers are best off giving the wine as much air as possible. Otherwise, this is an excellent effort. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2015.  

Readers will note a change with these new releases from Luca Roagna. The top Barolo and Barbaresco selections are all being released at the same time, which means there is basically one vintage on the market at a time, rather than the mish-mash of vintages that was previously the custom. Roagna has also stepped up the quality of his corks, which is quite welcome for wines that are meant to age for decades. As always, the winemaking style at Roagna is deeply imbued in tradition. Late harvests, extended macerations and long aging in neutral oak inform wines of great personality.

1507,Roagna,Barolo la Pira Vecchie Vigne,"Dark plums, black cherries menthol and tar burst from the glass in the 2007 Barolo La Pira Vecchie Vigne. It possesses stunning depth in a vivid expression of Nebbiolo that is hard to capture with mere words. Totally alive in the glass, the 2007 is endowed with gorgeous purity and nuance, which nicely complements its full-bodied, authoritative personality. Firm tannins support layers of dark fruit on the masculine finish. This is a fabulous showing from Roagna. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.

1508,Roagna,Barbaresco Pajè Vecchie Vigne,"The 2007 Barbaresco Paje Vecchie Vigne is a serious wine. Juicy dark cherries, tar, mint, licorice and menthol burst from the glass in this exuberant, intensely perfumed wine. As open and seductive as this is, there is plenty of underlying structure. The 2007 is wonderfully alive and vivid in the glass. The finish is at once powerful and weightless in the way only Pinot Noir and Nebbiolo can be. This is an exemplary wine in every way. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2027.

Mint, freshly cut flowers and red berries all come to life in this precise, chiseled Barbaresco. The firm Montefico tannins support the finish, giving the wine much of its focus and sense of proportion. As always, Montefico shows the vibrant, nuanced side of Barbaresco.

There is nothing absolutely out of place in this soft, supple Barbaresco. This isn't a huge wine, but rather it is the detail, inner perfume and overall harmony that are most convincing. There is a pure centeredness to the Asili that is striking. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022.

Dark cherries, plums, menthol and flowers flow through to the rich, enveloping finish as this broad-shouldered yet utterly impeccable wine opens up in the glass. Like so many wines in this vintage, the 2007 is open for business yet also appears to have more than enough structure to age well for many years. Sweet floral notes, spices and tobacco reappear on a gorgeous finish. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2027.

A rich, broad-shouldered Barbaresco, the Paje flows with the essence of tobacco, smoke, plums and orange rind. There is an exotic quality to the Paje that is deeply intriguing. Although appealing today, the 2007 should also continue to drink well for a number of years. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2022.

There is a hint of overripeness on the finish that detracts a touch from the wine's balance. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2017.

1514,Roagna,Barbaresco Crichët Pajé,"The 2001 Barbaresco Crichet Paje comes across as very young, but then again it was only bottled August 2010! Freshly cut flowers, licorice and mint are some of the notes that flow from this vibrant, perfumed Barbaresco. The 2001 fleshes out beautifully in the glass. It is a towering wine that can be enjoyed within the next few years, but ideally it is best left alone for as long as readers can be patient. This is a fabulous showing from Luca Roagna. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2031. 

Luca Roagna released his 2001 Crichet Paje just last year, so it might seem odd to include it in this retrospective, but I never miss a chance to taste these wines. Roagna’s Baroli and Barbareschi remain some of the mos traditional, old school wines in Piemonte.

1515,Roagna,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2010 Dolcetto d’Alba is a big, super-ripe wine bursting with blackberries, blueberries, spices and licorice. There is no shortage of personality in this rich, almost decadent Dolcetto. As always, this is one of the most intense Dolcetti readers will come across. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2018.  

You never know what to expect from Luca Roagna. That is one of the reasons a visit can’t possibly be boring, there are just too many new things to absorb with seemingly every tasting. Some things don’t change, however, including a decidedly traditional approach to vineyard work and winemaking which emphasizes late harvests, the use of natural yeasts and extended barrel aging. Roagna fans will be sad to learn that the estate recently lost access to the fruit they had been working with from Vigna Rionda. A few Riservas from that site are still aging in the cellar, but 2006 will be the last vintage of Roagna Riondas. In exchange, Roagna has a new Barolo from the Le Coste vineyard in Monforte. That wine appears to still be a work in progress. Everything else I tasted was superb, including the 2002 Barbaresco Crichet Paje. Readers should be aware that because of the limited production of many of these wines (including the 2002 Crichet Paje) Roagna has decided to release the wines as a mixed case of 12 bottles. Some of the single wines will naturally be harder to source on their own. Readers who want to learn more about Roagna may want to take a look at my recent video interview on www.erobertparker.com

1516,Roagna,Barbaresco Asili,"The 2006 Barbaresco Asili is stunning. Silky Asili tannins frame a deeply expressive core of red berries, flowers, spices and anise, all of which come together beautifully in this sumptuous, layered Barbaresco. This will be a fascinating wine to follow, especially since it was only bottled in August, 2011. Today it is racy, sexy and flat-out compelling, but it is young and very primary. This is textbook Asili given a little more richness through low yields. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2026.  

You never know what to expect from Luca Roagna. That is one of the reasons a visit can’t possibly be boring, there are just too many new things to absorb with seemingly every tasting. Some things don’t change, however, including a decidedly traditional approach to vineyard work and winemaking which emphasizes late harvests, the use of natural yeasts and extended barrel aging. Roagna fans will be sad to learn that the estate recently lost access to the fruit they had been working with from Vigna Rionda. A few Riservas from that site are still aging in the cellar, but 2006 will be the last vintage of Roagna Riondas. In exchange, Roagna has a new Barolo from the Le Coste vineyard in Monforte.

1517,Roagna,Barbaresco Montefico,"The 2006 Barbaresco Montefico is another dazzling Barbaresco from Roagna. The Montefico is naturally deeper and richer than Asili. It shows tons of depth and intensity and sheer muscle in a virile style that is typical of this vineyard. Mint, flowers and crushed rocks wrap around a firm finish that reminds me of Bruno Giacosa’s 1978 Montefico. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2031.

It is a model of understated elegance dominated by a mineral-laced sense of classicism that is quite beautiful. This is a hugely intriguing, complex Barbera that demands the taster’s full attention.

Crushed flowers, red cherries, spices and licorice are some of the aromas and flavors from this delicate, dare I say it – Burgundian – Barolo. Silky tannins and floral notes frame the perfumed finish. I don’t expect this to be one of the most long-lived wines Roagna has ever made, but in exchange it should drink well right out of the gate. Readers should note that this is the same Barolo that was previously known as the La Rocca e La Pira. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2020.

It shows lovely juiciness in a vinous style that will require further bottle age for the full range of tertiary aromatics to develop. Mint, flowers and sweet herbs develop in the glass, adding complexity. Today, the 2005 Paje looks to be a relatively early maturing wine for Roagna, which is not necessarily a bad thing given the estate’s reputation for making wines that take an eternity to peak. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2025.

1521,Roagna,Barbaresco Crichët Pajé,"The 2002 Barbaresco Crichet Paje is breathtaking. Roagna had the patience to look beyond the cold, wet summer and early fall. The Nebbiolo harvest took place in late October. For the risk, Roagna was rewarded with one of the greatest Barbareschi made in the last decade, perhaps longer. The 2002 Crichet Paje is a towering effort and a tribute to the greatness of Nebbiolo. It is a pure, dazzling wine with no hard edges, no signs whatsoever of greenness and a seamless expression of fruit. Layers of red fruit emerge effortlessly from this deep, powerful wine. The 2002 Crichet Paje is miraculously pure, with a freshness and vibrancy that is unbelievable. There is more than enough underlying structure to support many years and decades of fine drinking. Simply put, this is a heroic effort from Luca Roagna. As the saying goes, no guts, no glory. There are plenty of guts here. Roagna deserves every bit of praise he will receive for this stratospheric Barbaresco. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.

It is a towering Barbaresco that should be buried in the deepest corner of the cellar. It will be many years before this immortal wine is ready to show its cards, but its potential is amply evident today. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2040.

1523,Roagna,Barbaresco Riserva Pajè,"The 2000 Barbaresco Riserva Paje is positively explosive. Sweet mentholated, balsamic notes wrap around a muscular core of fruit as this massive, textured Barbaresco opens up in the glass. The Riserva is unbelievably youthful, yet it promises to drink beautifully after another few years in bottle. It is a stunner. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2030.

The wine opens up beautifully in the glass, showing terrific nuance, complexity and pedigree. Simply put, this is a joyous bottle of Barbaresco Piedmont fans won’t want to be without.

This is a wonderfully sexy, graceful Barbaresco from Roagna that should drink well upon release. Given the wine’s modest structure, I am not sure how much upside there is for significant evolution in the cellar, but the Asili is drinking very nicely now, and should continue to do so for at least the next decade or so.

The aromatics seem to be developing faster than the fruit and structural components. My impression is that this won’t be a terribly long-lived wine, but it should drink well to age twenty or so.

As good as this is, I am concerned about the degree to which the bouquet already shows signs of tertiary evolution. Readers may recall that in 2003 Roagna made just one Barbaresco from his holdings in Paje. In 2004 he made three. The top selections may turn out to be thrilling, but there is little doubt this entry-level bottling has suffered at the expense of those wines. Ultimately, this Barbaresco comes across as tired and offering little in the way of upside potential. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2022.

This explosive wine bursts onto the palate with a complex array of licorice, tobacco, grilled herbs, tar, dried roses and smoke. The aromas and flavors are woven together in a fabric of extraordinary complexity that seems to reveal new shades of nuance with every taste. Still massive and powerful, this has another two decades ahead of it. Astute readers will note that the 1990 Crichet Paje was released as a Vino da Tavola instead of as a Barbaresco Riserva. At the time, regulations required producers to apply for the Riserva designation while the wines were still fermenting. At first, Alfredo Roagna did not think this particular lot was Riserva-quality so he didn’t declare the wine as a Riserva, and thus had no choice but to use the Vino da Tavola designation when he changed his mind years later based on the positive development of the wine in barrel. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.

I was deeply impressed with the wines I tasted from Roagna, although I was only able to sample a small subset of the estate’s 1989s and 1990s. This small, family run estate has had several periods of ups and downs over the years, but when the wines are on, they are magnificent. These wines were made by Alfredo Roagna.

Considering its nearly 20 years of age, I can’t ask for anything more for an entry-level Barbaresco in this vintage. The 1990 Barbaresco is a blend of vineyards in Paje, Asili and Montefico. This is wonderful juice. Anticipated maturity: 2010.

The wine reveals a core of perfumed fruit that might easily be mistaken for Burgundy. I am sure the magnum format has helped preserve a measure of freshness. Still, considering this is the entry-level Barbaresco in 1989, the wine frankly has no business being this outstanding. The 1989 Barbaresco is a blend of vineyards in Paje, Asili and Montefico. A Riserva and Crichet Paje were also made that year. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2015.

As always, this medium-bodied offering is one of the quirkiest Dolcettos around as it shows off much more tertiary nuance than the vast majority of its peers. With time in the glass the wine's inner perfume makes an appearance but this remains a serious Dolcetto best suited to the dinner table. Readers who enjoy traditionally built wines will find much to admire here. Although I typically enjoy Dolcetto on the young side, this is one wine that should age very well. Roagna's Dolcetto is made from vines in Paje and Faset and saw a lengthy maceration in oak lasting 30 days. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2016.  

Roagna is one of the most fascinating properties in Piedmont. The family owns small, but choice, plots in some of the region's best vineyards. The estate makes a wide range of wines, but the Barbarescos and Barolos are the highlights. In top vintages there can be as many as three selections of Barbaresco (Barbaresco Paje, Barbaresco Riserva Paje and Barbaresco Crichet Paje) and two of Barolo (Barolo La Rocca e La Pira, Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira). The wines are fermented in oak vats and remain on the skins until mid-December, after which they are aged in oak barrels for as many as a dozen years prior to being bottled. This year Roagna has three new wines; a Barbera made from vines in the La Rocca e La Pira vineyard in Castiglione Falletto, and small-production Barbarescos from the Asili and Montefico vineyards. Among the many highlights are the 2003 Barolo La Rocca e La Pira and Barbaresco Paje, which are both exceptional (there were no Riservas made that year), the 2004 Barbera d-Alba, the 2004 Barbaresco Asili, the 1995 Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira and the 2000 Barbaresco Crichet Paje. As readers can deduce, the wines are usually released later than most and can be hard to find, but they are increasingly worth the effort. Quality has never been higher here, and as I have written before, Luca Roagna is one of Piedmont's most promising young producers.

As readers can deduce, the wines are usually released later than most and can be hard to find, but they are increasingly worth the effort. Quality has never been higher here, and as I have written before, Luca Roagna is one of Piedmont's most promising young producers.

1541,Roagna,Barbaresco Asili,"The 2004 Barbaresco Asili is an incredibly silky yet powerful Barbaresco graced with superb purity. This is classic Asili; from the expressive, sweet bouquet to the soft fruit and the cashmere-like finish. Still quite young, this utterly graceful and convincing Barbaresco Asili is terrific. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.  

Roagna is one of the most fascinating properties in Piedmont. The family owns small, but choice, plots in some of the region's best vineyards. The estate makes a wide range of wines, but the Barbarescos and Barolos are the highlights. In top vintages there can be as many as three selections of Barbaresco (Barbaresco Paje, Barbaresco Riserva Paje and Barbaresco Crichet Paje) and two of Barolo (Barolo La Rocca e La Pira, Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira). The wines are fermented in oak vats and remain on the skins until mid-December, after which they are aged in oak barrels for as many as a dozen years prior to being bottled. This year Roagna has three new wines; a Barbera made from vines in the La Rocca e La Pira vineyard in Castiglione Falletto, and small-production Barbarescos from the Asili and Montefico vineyards.

1542,Roagna,Barbera d'Alba,"The 2004 Barbera d-Alba (from vines in Castiglione Falletto) is an exceptionally pure, crystalline Barbera with gorgeous layers of ripe, dark fruit. The wine reveals lovely inner sweetness and fine, yet firm tannins. Menthol, tar and licorice linger on the sublime, enchanting finish. This is the first release from vines planted in 1999 in the highest part of the La Rocca e La Pira vineyard, an exposure that could have easily been used for Nebbiolo. Sadly, there are just 2,500 bottles to go around. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2019.

1543,Roagna,Barbaresco Pajè,"The 2003 Barbaresco Paje is an insanely beautiful, huge wine loaded with fruit. Amazingly, the 2003 Paje remains almost primary, with little development of tertiary aromas and flavors. The tannins are almost impossibly elegant for a wine from this torrid vintage and the level of freshness is unmatched by any other 2003 Barbaresco. The wine's inner perfume and sweet, plump core of fruit hint at a hot vintage, but the balance here is simply mind-blowing. Subtle suggestions of menthol, smoke, tar and spices come to life on the finish. The Paje is made from vines in excess of 20 years old. This is the Barbaresco of the vintage. In 2003 Roagna sacrificed their top lots (usually destined for the Riservas) to strengthen this entry-level bottling, and it shows. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2028.

1544,Roagna,Barolo la Rocce e la Pira,"The 2003 Barolo La Rocca e La Pira, from vines between 20 and 50 years of age, is an expressive wine graced with dark cherries, plums, spices, cedar, menthol and minerals in a surprisingly accessible style for this producer. Medium in body, the wine offers superb length and finessed tannins that caress the palate through to the close. This is a little rounder, deeper and also plusher than the decidedly firm and austere Paje, and it is nearly as sublime. Here, too, Roagna passed on making a Riserva, blending the juice from their best lots into this entry-level Barolo. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2028.

1545,Roagna,Langhe Rosso,"The 2003 Langhe Rosso is a soft, approachable wine with an attractive core of sweet, ripe fruit. Early signs of advancement suggest this won't be an especially long-lived wine, but it should drink quite nicely over the next handful of years. Sweet tobacco, spices, dried cherries, cedar and worn-in leather round out the sublime, impeccable close. The Langhe Rosso is equal parts Nebbiolo from Barolo and Nebbiolo from Barbaresco from young vines under 20 years of age. This is a superb effort from Roagna. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2015.

An exotic, compelling array of wild cherries, tobacco, sweet herbs and licorice all comes together in this sensual, well-articulated Barbaresco. The wine's balance and poise are remarkable. The 1999 Barbaresco Riserva Paje was made from vines that were more than 60 years old and spent five years in barrel. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2029.

The wine reveals gorgeous inner perfume, refined tannins and a remarkably vibrant personality considering it's nearly 15 years of age. This is another pristine Barolo from Roagna. The 1995 Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira is made from vines that are more than 70 years old. The wine spent 12 years in barrel. Unfortunately there are only 900 bottles to go around.

With air this medium-bodied wine puts on weight as balsamic notes emerge, adding further complexity. Roagna’s Dolcetto saw an incredible 30 days of maceration on the skins followed by a full year in oak, an unusual regime in Piedmont these days to say the least, but one which gives this wine notable complexity for Dolcetto. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2011.  

This is a fascinating set of wines from Roagna, a historic estate in Barbaresco that is once again gaining the visibility and recognition it deserves. Proprietor Luca Roagna is young, humble and incredibly passionate about preserving his family’s traditional approach to making wine. The estate works with old vines, which are trained to ripen late. In the cellar, macerations are very long and aging takes place primarily in French oak casks. Roagna is one of Italy’s most promising young producers and his future looks to be very bright. This year, as last, I found some of the wines not fully perfect in their aromatics, with notes of woodiness that suggest the wines may be spending too much time in barrel. According to Luca Roagna, these aromas and flavors can be attributed to the new barrels the estate began using around 2000. Still, my sense is that the wines could achieve an entirely different level of quality if a few years of the barrel aging were replaced with time in bottle.

1549,Roagna,Barolo Vigna Rionda,"Roagna’s 2004 Barolo Vigna Rionda remains a mystery to me. I have tasted four bottles of this wine and found some variation. My first bottle was extraordinary, but subsequent bottles have been far less exciting. The wine possesses lovely liqueur-like fruit woven into suggestions of dried roses, spices and licorice. The best bottle reminded me of some of the greatest Vigna Riondas I have ever had in its freshness and structure, while other bottles have been more advanced, and while still pretty, lacking the sheer perfume and verve of the great bottle. That said, Nebbiolo can be a perplexing wine and some of the bottles may have just been shut down, so only time will tell which is the real Roagna Vigna Rionda. My best advice is to suggest that readers taste this wine before making any major commitments. This Barolo Vigna Rionda was vinified by Canale with the help of Luca Roagna. The wine saw a relatively short (by Roagna standards) maceration time of 60 days followed by roughly two years in oak. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2029.

1550,Roagna,Solea,"The 2003 Solea is a unique white made from late-harvested 75% Chardonnay ad 25% Nebbiolo that saw about a week of contact on the skins followed by five years in oak. This full-bodied white is loaded with super-ripe tropical fruit and suggestions of botrytis. The wine offers excellent length and beguiling aromatics (from the Nebbiolo) in a unique, quirky style. I would be tempted to drink this after dinner with cheese, as the wine cleanses the palate beautifully. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2013.

The wine offers tremendous length and persistence on the palate as its inner core of fruit emerges over time. Somewhat reticent at first, the wine needs quite a bit of time to open up. Some tasters might object to the less than clean aromatics but after tasting two bottles of this Barolo I felt the wine had sufficient merits to compensate for those imperfections. The Barolo is made from the estate’s younger vines, with ages ranging from 20-50 years. The wine saw 80 days of maceration on the skins (in wood vats) followed by five years in oak prior to bottling.

1552,Roagna,Barbaresco Riserva Crichët Pajé,"Roagna’s 1999 Barbaresco Riserva Crichet Paje is an extremely primary, dense wine loaded with dark red fruit. Notes of smoke, earthiness, cedar and tobacco emerge in the glass, rounding out this powerful, masculine Barbaresco. Noticeably better on the palate than on the nose, the Riserva Crichet Paje comes across as a wine that probably spent too much time in oak. It remains an imposing but also vibrant wine that should develop beautifully in bottle. The tannins are big, but also well-integrated. The Crich?t Paj? is made from vines with an average age of 60 years. The wine saw an incredible 90 days of maceration in wood vats followed by eight years in oak.

The wine offers excellent density and richness in its dark plums, cherries, leather and spices, but there are some impurities that are most likely the case of the wine having spent too much time in oak that are accentuated in a smaller vintage such as 1998. The Riserva La Rocca e La Pira is made from vines with an average age of 70 years. The wine saw 85 days of maceration in wood vats followed by eight years in oak.

Roagna’s Dolcetto sees an unheard of 30 days’ of maceration. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2009.

1555,Roagna,Barolo Vigna Rionda,"The 2003 Barolo Vigna Rionda is the newest addition to the estate’s line-up. Barolo lovers are well aware that Vigna Rionda is one of the most legendary sites in wine, so a new label is sure to elicit a high level of interest. Roagna’s Vigna Rionda is made from the oldest and most historic part of the hill, the same plots that were the source of the most legendary Riondas made in the past.  Roagna’s 2003 Barolo Vigna Rionda opens with the essence of rose petals followed by gorgeous layers of red cherries, baking spices, cocoa, leather, menthol and licorice. At once delicate and powerful, it captures the essence of this famed site with remarkable elegance considering the less-than-ideal quality of the vintage. The 2003 Rionda saw a shorter period of oak aging than is typical for the estate’s other Barolos and I can’t help thinking that has helped maintain an additional level of vibrancy here. This is a promising Barolo, and it will be fascinating to see what Roagna can do in less extreme vintages. For now, it is an auspicious debut. Barolo is never inexpensive, but this wine offers superb value for the money. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023. 

Luca Roagna is one of the most promising young winemakers in the Langhe. Low yields, late harvests, long macerations and extended periods of oak aging are the rule at this traditionally-minded estate. Historically Barolo and Barbaresco were left to macerate on the skins until around the Christmas holidays, a practice unheard of today but still followed here. The normal bottlings of Barolo and Barbaresco typically see around 50 days of maceration while the selections may see as many as 75 days. The wines then undergo a lengthy sojourn in oak which allows them to develop the tertiary notes that the estate seeks. The wines spend an additional year to year and a half of bottle age before being released. I have mixed feelings about the long oak aging the estate prefers. In some cases the wines have the stuffing to stand up to extended periods in oak, but in other cases I can't help thinking the wines would retain more fruit and freshness if they were bottled earlier. The wines are also very delicate and don't respond well to sudden movement or temperature changes immediately prior to serving. I have had my best luck letting them gradually warm from cold cellar temperature and opening them several hours before serving. Readers who appreciated traditionally made wines should be sure to put Roagna on their radar screens.

1557,Roagna,Barolo Riserva la Rocce e la Pira,"The 1997 Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira is loaded with ripe dark fruit, leather, tobacco, cedar and spice nuances. It offers outstanding length as well as balance in a style that captures the sweet, seductive style of the vintage. Although it retains good freshness for its age I wonder if a shorter stay in oak might have been beneficial in this hot vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2017. 

Luca Roagna is one of the most promising young winemakers in the Langhe. Low yields, late harvests, long macerations and extended periods of oak aging are the rule at this traditionally-minded estate. Historically Barolo and Barbaresco were left to macerate on the skins until around the Christmas holidays, a practice unheard of today but still followed here. The normal bottlings of Barolo and Barbaresco typically see around 50 days of maceration while the selections may see as many as 75 days. The wines then undergo a lengthy sojourn in oak which allows them to develop the tertiary notes that the estate seeks. The wines spend an additional year to year and a half of bottle age before being released. I have mixed feelings about the long oak aging the estate prefers. In some cases the wines have the stuffing to stand up to extended periods in oak, but in other cases I can't help thinking the wines would retain more fruit and freshness if they were bottled earlier.

1558,Roagna,Barolo Riserva la Rocce e la Pira,"Roagna’s 1993 Barolo Riserva La Rocca e La Pira spent a whopping eleven and a half years in oak! Its tannins have mostly melted away, leaving a sublime, ethereal Barolo redolent of dried roses, plums, prunes, baking spices, leather, menthol and anise. It possesses outstanding balance and enough underlying structure to drink well for another decade. The opportunity to purchase an older, ready to drink vintage directly from the producer doesn’t come around too often and Roagna should be commended for making wines like this 1993 Barolo Riserva  available. It is a lovely effort. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2017.

As it sits in the glass a multitude of smoke, tar, violet, menthol and spice nuances make an appearance, completing this delicious, classically structured Barolo.

1570,Clos de Tart,Barolo la Rocce e la Pira,"The estate’s 2001 Barolo La Rocca e La Pira is a big, powerful wine endowed with masses of dark fruit, earthiness, leather, licorice, spices and tobacco. The wine offers tremendous length and persistence on the palate as its inner core of fruit emerges over time. Somewhat reticent at first, the wine needs quite a bit of time to open up. Some tasters might object to the less than clean aromatics but after tasting two bottles of this Barolo I felt the wine had sufficient merits to compensate for those imperfections. The Barolo is made from the estate’s younger vines, with ages ranging from 20-50 years. The wine saw 80 days of maceration on the skins (in wood vats) followed by five years in oak prior to bottling. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2025.  

This is a fascinating set of wines from Roagna, a historic estate in Barbaresco that is once again gaining the visibility and recognition it deserves. Proprietor Luca Roagna is young, humble and incredibly passionate about preserving his family’s traditional approach to making wine. The estate works with old vines, which are trained to ripen late. In the cellar, macerations are very long and aging takes place primarily in French oak casks. Roagna is one of Italy’s most promising young producers and his future looks to be very bright. This year, as last, I found some of the wines not fully perfect in their aromatics, with notes of woodiness that suggest the wines may be spending too much time in barrel. According to Luca Roagna, these aromas and flavors can be attributed to the new barrels the estate began using around 2000. Still, my sense is that the wines could achieve an entirely different level of quality if a few years of the barrel aging were replaced with time in bottle.

1571,Clos de Tart,Barbaresco Riserva Crichët Pajé,"Roagna’s 1999 Barbaresco Riserva Crichet Paje is an extremely primary, dense wine loaded with dark red fruit. Notes of smoke, earthiness, cedar and tobacco emerge in the glass, rounding out this powerful, masculine Barbaresco. Noticeably better on the palate than on the nose, the Riserva Crichet Paje comes across as a wine that probably spent too much time in oak. It remains an imposing but also vibrant wine that should develop beautifully in bottle. The tannins are big, but also well-integrated. The Crich?t Paj? is made from vines with an average age of 60 years. The wine saw an incredible 90 days of maceration in wood vats followed by eight years in oak.

Here, too, the aromas aren’t perfectly clean, but unlike some of the other wines in this lineup, those notes appear on the palate as well. The wine offers excellent density and richness in its dark plums, cherries, leather and spices, but there are some impurities that are most likely the case of the wine having spent too much time in oak that are accentuated in a smaller vintage such as 1998. The Riserva La Rocca e La Pira is made from vines with an average age of 70 years. The wine saw 85 days of maceration in wood vats followed by eight years in oak.

Roagna’s Dolcetto sees an unheard of 30 days’ of maceration. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2009.

1574,Clos de Tart,Barolo Vigna Rionda,"The 2003 Barolo Vigna Rionda is the newest addition to the estate’s line-up. Barolo lovers are well aware that Vigna Rionda is one of the most legendary sites in wine, so a new label is sure to elicit a high level of interest. Roagna’s Vigna Rionda is made from the oldest and most historic part of the hill, the same plots that were the source of the most legendary Riondas made in the past.  Roagna’s 2003 Barolo Vigna Rionda opens with the essence of rose petals followed by gorgeous layers of red cherries, baking spices, cocoa, leather, menthol and licorice. At once delicate and powerful, it captures the essence of this famed site with remarkable elegance considering the less-than-ideal quality of the vintage. The 2003 Rionda saw a shorter period of oak aging than is typical for the estate’s other Barolos and I can’t help thinking that has helped maintain an additional level of vibrancy here. This is a promising Barolo, and it will be fascinating to see what Roagna can do in less extreme vintages. For now, it is an auspicious debut. Barolo is never inexpensive, but this wine offers superb value for the money. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023.

The wine displays a deep ruby color (more saturated than his other offerings) and a splendidly rich, full-bodied finish with noticeable tannin and high alcohol.  Approachable now, it should last for 10-15+ years.  Impressive wines!

On the palate, the wine is supple, medium to full-bodied and textural, its richness buttressed by good energy and cut. This cuvée is a blend of Les Narvaux, Les Tillets, Les Chevalières and the Clos du Cromin, so contains some high-class fruit. It wouldn't be a crime to enjoy this in its youth, as it's already generous and accessible.",,RP (90-92)
1657,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Chevrets,"Boillot's 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Chevrets offers up an attractive nose of creamy red cherry, spice and asphalt, followed by a medium to full-bodied, firm but elegant palate with a core of attractively juicy, crunchy fruit. A very nice Volnay 1er Cru.",,RP (90-92)
1658,Henri Boillot,Volnay Village,"Boillot's 2015 Volnay Village, which in fact hails from the 1er Cru of Clos de la Rougeotte, offers up an expressive bouquet of cherries and dried flowers, framed by creamy new oak, followed by a supple, medium to full-bodied palate with chalky tannins and a nice core of crunchy fruit.",,RP (90-92)
1659,Henri Boillot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was the most subtle of eight wines tasted from the vineyard, but it exudes mineralité, tension and class with gorgeous oyster shell scents percolating through with time. The palate is very detailed with a fine bead of acidity, beautifully balanced with a saline tang that builds throughout and flourishes toward the finish. This is an outstanding Bâtard-Montrachet from Henri Boillot, one that comes highly recommended.",,RP (90-92)
1660,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots from Henri Boillot has a surprisingly simple bouquet that does not really get both hands on the terroir. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly bitter entry, structured, stern and missing some flow on the last third of the wine. However, it seems to improve and gain some manners with aeration, and though there clearly remains new oak to be subsumed, it has the substance to repay those who cellar it for 4-5 years. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (90-92)
1661,Henri Boillot,Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Perrieres,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Perrieres has a fulsome bouquet with plenty of citrus fruit, fresh pear, granite and smoke scents, nicely defined and gaining more delineation as it blossoms in the glass. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry. It is terse, strict and linear but then again, that is why you come to Puligny. Delivering some lovely marine/oyster shell notes towards the finish, this is a superb wine that should age with style. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1662,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières from Henri Boillot took time to unfold in the glass, but eventually reveals attractive lime flower, cold granite and yellow flower scents, later accompanied by acacia honey. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity. There is just the right amount of bitter lemon here that imparts tension from start to finish, leading to a composed finish with a salinity that begs another sip. Quite simply, a delicious Meursault. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1663,Henri Boillot,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru is more fruit-forward on the nose with ebullient raspberry and wild strawberry aromas, a pleasant touch of reduction that recedes with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe tannin, the fleshy cassis-tinged fruit offset by a fine thread of acidity, leading to an energetic and virile finish. This should give plenty of drinking pleasure over the next decade. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1664,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère,Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère has a comparatively straightforward if well-defined bouquet although it does not have the cohesion and complexity of Boillot's Les Perrières. The palate has a brisk and stony entry. There is plenty of salinity here: strict and precise with quite a punchy sea-influenced finish. It calls out for a plate of fruits de mer that would counterbalance its terseness. Tasted May 2016.,,RP (90-92)
1665,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Caillerets,"The 1962 Volnay 1er Cru Cailleret from Domaine Henri Billet testified the greatness of this vintage in Burgundy. Come across a great bottle and you will be in for a treat. This 1962 had a deep color considering its age. The palate is fragrant and does not disguise its age, yet it opens with chlorine-tinged dark plum fruit, becoming gamey and animally in the glass. The palate is nicely balanced with a touch of seaweed on the entry, an attracted if degraded core of red fruit with a cedar-infused, almost Bordeaux-like finish. I remarked at the time that it is actually more like a 1964 Burgundy, but irrespective of that, it is a wonderful mature Volnay. Tasted February 2016.",,RP (90-92)
1666,Henri Boillot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru has a clean, well defined bouquet with hints of almond and white chocolate, although I was seeking a little more personality to come through. The palate shows the nose how it's done and it is probably more indicative: spice, ginger, almond, citrus fruit and a touch of white peach. This is very complex and the more you remain in its presence, the more it wins you over. Cellar this for 4-5 years and you should have a very fine Corton Charlemagne on your hands, but it covets its secrets for now. ",,RP (90-92)
1667,Henri Boillot,Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens,"The 2014 Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens has a fragrant bouquet, almost Volnay-like, gentle and caressing with scents of raspberry and cranberry, contained but pure. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry, sappy red berry fruit here with a pleasing saline element towards the finish. There is very prudent use of new oak here and the wine really shows its terroir to good effect. Very fine. ",,RP (90-92)
1668,Henri Boillot,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchere,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère has a taut and linear, but intense bouquet with attractive apple blossom, flint and orange zest aromas that open with a sense of confidence in the glass. The palate is well balanced with quite a piercing citric entry. There is very good weight in the mouth here, feisty and spicy with a dab of fresh ginger perking up the finish. Give this a couple of years and you should have a fine Puligny-Montrachet. ",,RP (90-92)
1669,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Fremiets,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Fremiets has an engaging bouquet: leafy red berry fruit, cranberry and raspberry pastille, although there is still some oak to be subsumed here. The palate is medium-bodied with crunchy red fruit, a pinch of black pepper on the tip of the tongue, though needing more flesh and weight to develop on the finish. Not bad, but not the best I have encountered this vintage. ",,RP (90-92)
1670,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Chevrets,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Les Chevrets showed a little more fruit concentration, a bit more pizzazz on the nose compared to the Volnay Fremiets: cranberry and black plum, undergrowth note emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with crunchy red and black fruit. There is a little coarseness here at the moment, although it should be abraded by time. The finish is quite Pommard-like--austere but nicely defined. ",,RP (90-92)
1671,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet Village from Henri Boillot has a tightly wound bouquet that needs some encouragement, but eventually reveals attractive flint and cold limestone scents, a touch of undergrowth in the background. The palate is fresh and vibrant with Granny Smith apple and pear, though I was seeking a little more joie-de-vivre on the rather abrupt finish. Hopefully that will come with bottle age. ",,RP (90-92)
1672,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère has a captivating, mineral-driven, sea-spray-tinged bouquet that is complex and compelling. The palate is very well balanced with finely tuned acidity, harmonious and poised, though a Puligny-Montrachet that is only just beginning to show what it can do. Cellar this for four to six years and see what comes out the other side, as it could merit an even higher evaluation then.  ",,RP (90-92)
1673,Henri Boillot,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru displayed the most reduction of the five Bonnes-Mares tasted together, but underneath there are intense black cherry, cassis and truffle aromas that gather momentum in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin. This is succulent and poised, very harmonious and elegant, gently building to a very satisfying, mineral-led finish. This is a superb Bonnes-Mares from Henri Boillot.  ",,RP (90-92)
1674,Henri Boillot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru  from Henri Boillot has quite a powerful bouquet with touches of dried honey and yellow flowers, though you have to swerve around noticeable reduction. The palate has decent weight, quite forward in the mouth with bitter lemon and dried orange peel notes. The finish is missing finesse and poise at first but it recovers to a degree if not quite fulfilling all its ambition. Give it a couple more years to find its groove. ",,RP (90-92)
1675,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières from Henri Boillot (whose parcel is incidentally adjacent to Dominique Lafon’s) has a modest nose: beeswax and lime flower coming through, just a touch of bruised apple, though like many Genevrières 2012, it seems to lack the precision of Les Charmes. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry, brisk and gaining more tension towards the finish, the most satisfying part of this wine thanks to its elegance and finesse. ",,RP (90-92)
1676,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Perrières from Henri Boillot has a light, walnut and granite scented nose that needs more intensity but is nicely defined. The palate is slightly bitter on the entry, though the acidity is nicely judged. It never quite builds as you were hoping after the aromatics, does not quite achieve the delineation and nervosité to match the power. It actually gains elegance in the glass and is a delightful Puligny, albeit one that needs more personality to develop.",,RP (90-92)
1677,Henri Boillot,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens from Henri Boillot has a very attractive bouquet: marine-influenced black fruit with fine delineation and poise. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin and plenty of bright red fruit, lightly spiced with a harmonious, tensile finish that feels long and sustained. It dispenses with some of its lush ""puppy fat,"" but is an all-round, very respectable Pommard. ",,RP (90-92)
1678,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Volnay 1er Cru les Santenots du Milieu from Henri Boillot was showing just a little VA on the nose, though not too severe and it give its red berry, cranberry and redcurrant scents a lift a kick up the backside. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy, ""stringy"" tannin; it is quite saline in the mouth and slightly conservative, foursquare but a nicely controlled finish. Fine, if not best in show.",,RP (90-92)
1679,Henri Boillot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi from Henri Boillot has a lively, ebullient, slightly bubblegum-scented nose with plenty of red cherry fruit laced with a drop of balsamic. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and good acidity. This is a playful Pinot Noir, not complex but well balanced and with plenty of pinoté on the finish, finishing with a spicy tang. ",,RP (90-92)
1680,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, this example of the Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère 2011 from Henri Boillot did not quite ring as many bells as the previous bottle. Compared to the Meursault '11 from Ente, it is clearly more exotic on the nose with a petrol note that I did not notice before. The palate is rich, intense and quite powerful with piercing acidity and a slight reduction on the finish. I actually think there are better bottles of this out there. ",,RP (90-92)
1681,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Caillerets has a pretty, limestone-driven bouquet that opens in the glass, showing a little more nuance than the other 2013 premier cru Pulignys at this moment. The palate is very well balanced with finely tuned acidity. Henri Boillot compared it to a Chevalier-Montrachet on the finish, and I can see where he is coming from. Superb.",,RP (90-92)
1682,Henri Boillot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru has a complex bouquet: subtle grilled walnut notes tincturing the mineral scents. It is reticent at first, but unfolds nicely in the glass. The palate is very well balanced with good weight, nicely judged acidity, plenty of mineral notes, although the finish is just a little conservative. Still, there is a pleasant saline note lingering on the aftertaste. Give this several years in bottle - it just needs to develop more ""charm.""",,RP (90-92)
1683,Henri Boillot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chambertin Grand Cru was picked on the same day as the Clos de Bèze and matured entirely in new 350 liter oak barrels. It has an attractive floral bouquet that is more expressive compared to the Clos de Bèze at the moment, boysenberry and raspberry coulis notes developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, slightly chalky tannins, a crisp line of acidity and fine tension right through to the very finish. This is a classy Chambertin that needs several years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1684,Henri Boillot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru shows its class on the nose: more mineral-driven than the Bâtard-Montrachet, with touches of chalk and limestone accompanying the citrus fruit. The palate is harmonious on the entry with veins of orange rind and citrus peel right from start, gradually building in the mouth toward a confident finish. This is one of the best 2013s from Henri Boillot and on this showing, shoulder to shoulder with the Montrachet.",,RP (90-92)
1685,Henri Boillot,Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a backward, reticent nose at first, but it opens nicely with touches of oyster shell and limestone infusing the citrus fruit. The palate is clean and fresh, a pleasant symmetry here with finely tuned acidity and well-integrated oak that only makes a fleeting appearance right on the finish. This is an assured Criots that should drink earlier than either the Chevalier or the Montrachet.",,RP (90-92)
1686,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet les Combettes 1er Cru  has one of the more mineral-driven aromatics at the moment with fine delineation, the new wood nicely integrated. The palate is fresh and vibrant with green apple, freshly sliced pear and impressive energy and weight on the saline finish. This is an impressive les Combettes.",,RP (90-92)
1687,Henri Boillot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"From vines located around Aloxe-Corton, the 2013 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru has a lifted bouquet with scents of clear honey, yellow plum and limestone, linear in a Puligny style. The palate is clean and fresh with touches of spice on the entry. There is good weight in the mouth, crisp and almost terse toward the finish, with a pleasant saline note on the aftertaste. This is a fine Corton-Charlemagne.",,RP (90-92)
1688,Henri Boillot,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru has quite a rich nose for a 2013 (at least at this early juncture) with sous bois-tinged red and black fruit, touches of leather and game emerging with continued aeration. The palate is well balanced with toasty red fruit slightly obscuring what feels like fine tannins. This is backward and broody compared to its peers, although with several years it should melt together. Modern in style, it is undeniably well crafted. ",,RP (90-92)
1689,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Pucelles has the most expressive bouquet with bruised apple, Conference pear and limestone scents soaring from the glass. The palate is clean and crisp with almost piercing citric acidity, superb tension and a clean and precise finish, not unlike the Pucelles that I had just tasted chez Anne-Claude Leflaive. This has a long tail on the finish - excellent.",,RP (90-92)
1690,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes has a precise, citrus and yellow plum-scented bouquet with more minerality showing here than the Poruzots at the moment. The palate is taut and linear, but with admirable weight, a gentle grip in the mouth and a touch of spice and orange rind adorning the finish. This is one of the best Meursault '13s from Henri Boillot.",,RP (90-92)
1691,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"The 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Caillerets, which sees 50% new wood, has a floral, slightly candied bouquet with orange-sorbet scents infusing the mixture of red and black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, quite fine and tense, with a precise finish that neatly carries the oak. This is probably the best of the Volnay ‘13 from the domaine this year. ",,RP (90-92)
1692,Henri Boillot,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is extremely backward on the nose despite rigorous coaxing. The palate is balanced with a saline entry, a chalky texture, but needing just a little more weight to develop on the finish. Give this a couple of years in bottle - at the moment it feels a little dwarfed by Boillot's other '13 white Grand Crus.",,RP (90-92)
1693,Henri Boillot,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru, from a single parcel on the Chambolle side, has a rather opaque bouquet at the moment: broody dark berry fruit interlaced with iodine and violets. The palate is medium-bodied with touches of mocha and dark chocolate on the entry. Here, the oak comes through quite strongly, and tends to obscure the terroir on the finish. See what this does after 4-5 years in bottle and to allow the oak to fully integrate.  ",,RP (90-92)
1694,Henri Boillot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a terse, light estuarine-scented bouquet that takes time to unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a saline entry, quite pointed in the mouth, but it needs a little more tension and detail on the slightly anonymous finish (compared to the Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet for example.) Let's see if this gains something in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1695,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières did not quite deliver as much as the Meursault Charmes or Genevrières. It has a crisp floral bouquet with yellow flowers and wet pavement scents, more backward than the Genevrières. The palate is crisp and fresh with a keen line of acidity and a rather conservative, straitlaced, perhaps rather reticent finish. This was a rather perplexing showing.",,RP (90-92)
1696,Henri Boillot,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2013 Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens, which comes from two parcels located in Rugiens Haut and Rugiens Bas, has a perfumed, quite floral bouquet that is harmonious and focused. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannin, good acidity here, with a fresh and almost citric finish. Nicely structured with fine tannins, this carries the 50% new oak well and should give 10-15 years of pleasure. ",,RP (90-92)
1697,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Poruzots,"The 2013 Meursault les Poruzots sees 40% new wood. It has a precision and detail on the nose that handles the new oak in its stride, candied orange peel emerging with aeration. The palate is well balanced, with a keen line of acidity, harmonious, with hints of pralines developing toward the finish. This is a Meursault with a bit of nascent chutzpah.",,RP (90-92)
1698,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières has a crisp, citric bouquet that neatly carries the 50% new oak. The palate is well defined, but does not quite have the finesse and delineation that I was expecting on the finish…at least at the moment, hence my parsimonious score.",,RP (90-92)
1699,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Champans,"The 2013 Volnay Champans 1er Cru has a slightly more floral bouquet compared to the Fremiets, around the same level of aromatics. The palate is medium-bodied with a firm grip on the entry, moderate acidity and quite a dense, blackberry and spice-tinged finish that lingers nicely in the mouth. This is a satisfactory Volnay, though without the nervosité of the Caillerets.",,RP (90-92)
1700,Henri Boillot,Saint-Romain Blanc Village,"The 2013 Saint Romain has a light lime-blossom and green-apple bouquet. The palate is energetic and tense with good weight and an attractive lemon-curd-tinged finish. This might not warrant a slew of superlatives, but it is a very fine Saint Romaine to enjoy over several years. ",,RP (90-92)
1701,Henri Boillot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,"The 2013 Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi, which comes from a single parcel of 40-year-old vines, has a ripe raspberry and blackberry nose, the oak still needing time to be fully assimilated. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, quite conspicuous creamy new oak, although that will be subsumed by the time of bottling. Fine. ",,RP (90-92)
1702,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Frémiets,"The 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Fremiets comes from a single parcel of vines. The nose is well defined, dominated by the new oak at the moment, but there is sufficient fruit underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannins, quite dense at the moment with a touch of bell pepper on the masculine finish. Fine - if just a bit predictable.",,RP (90-92)
1703,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru En Chevret,"The 2013 Volnay 1er Cru les Chevrets errs more toward red fruit than black fruit, unlike Henri Boillot’s other premier cru. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, touches of mocha and leather emerging toward the finish where the new oak is conspicuous at the moment. Give this a couple of years in bottle. It just feels a little conservative compared to others at present.",,RP (90-92)
1704,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet, which comes from three lieux-dits, has a simple, slightly tertiary bouquet. The palate is taut on the entry with bitter lemon and lime leading to a short but delineated, mango-tinged finish. Fine, if nothing exceptional.",,RP (90-92)
1705,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"The 2013 Volnay les Santenots 1er Cru has a pastille-like bouquet with black cherries and raspberry jam scents that open nicely in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a gentle grip, a little spicier than the other Volnay premier crus, although it tapers in toward the finish, which left me feeling a little shortchanged.",,RP (90-92)
1706,Henri Boillot,Pommard Village,"The 2013 Pommard, which comes from a single parcel in Clos Blanc, has a slightly conservative bouquet with touches of rose petal infusing the red fruit. The palate is sappy and bright on the entry, nicely balanced with good substance on the finish. It will need a year to mellow and coalesce after bottling. ",,RP (90-92)
1707,Henri Boillot,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge, which sees 20% new oak, has a deep ruby color. The bouquet is quite concentrated with macerated small red cherries and blackberry, the palate tannic and a little dry, with firm tannins and black fruit on the slightly austere finish. This just needs to ""loosen its tie.""",,RP (90-92)
1708,Henri Boillot,Saint-Aubin Village,"The 2013 Saint Aubin Village, which is raised in 30% new oak, has a crisp, linear and almost Puligny-like bouquet. The palate is taut and citric on the entry with a good level of acidity, segueing into a bitter lemon finish that just needs a little more persistence. ",,RP (90-92)
1709,Henri Boillot,Volnay Village,"The 2013 Volnay Village comes from five lieux-dits and offers dense, broody black fruit on the nose, quite toasty at the moment. The palate is slightly chewy on the entry, quite a good extraction here, but just needing a touch more finesse on the finish. Not bad, but I would have liked more Volnaysian personality to permeate.",,RP (90-92)
1710,Henri Boillot,Meursault Village,"The 2013 Meursault, which comes from four lieux-dits, has a fragrant and floral bouquet with apple and apricot blossom, touches of pralines developing behind. In a word: pretty. The palate is simple and straightforward and is just missing a little terroir-expression at the moment, feels just a little generic.",,RP (90-92)
1711,Henri Boillot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2013 Bourgogne Blanc, which comes from several appellations, has a simple waxy bouquet. The palate is light and crisp, but is missing a little substance on the finish. Hopefully, it will gain more character with continued bottle age.",,RP (90-92)
1712,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Volnay les Santenots 1er Cru 2011 from Henri Boillot has a very composed bouquet with well-defined strawberry and raspberry fruit, intermingling with tertiary, woodland scents. This feels natural and composed. The palate is sweet and supple on the entry with fleshy red fruit, impressive depth and well-judged acidity. There is also fine backbone here and a beautifully composed finish full of finesse. Excellent. ",,RP (90-92)
1713,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Henri Boillot’s Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières 2011 has another austere nose but here there is real minerality with beguiling limestone and granitic aromas that are very well defined. The palate is very well balanced with the oak neatly embroidered into the fabric of the wine. Very poised with subtle orange rind, Manuka honey and spice notes on the finish. This is what a Genevrières should be. ",,RP (90-92)
1714,Henri Boillot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Among eight Chambertin 2011s tasted blind, Henri Boillot’s has the most opulent and showy bouquet with lavish red cherries, kirsch, orange peel and rose petal scents that all want attention…now. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, quite high acidity with an edgy, almost brittle finish. Still, there is fine persistency here with tangy marmalade and minerals lingering on the aftertaste.",,RP (90-92)
1715,Henri Boillot,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens ‘11 has a more oaky, broodier nose compared to its peers, slightly reduced, but with attractive tart red cherry and strawberry scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy entry, a fine thread of acidity and a crisp acidic bite on the finish that lends tautness and linearity. This is modern in style and very well crafted. ",,RP (90-92)
1716,Henri Boillot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Limpid garnet in colour, Henri Boillot’s Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru ‘11 has an inviting bouquet with lush red cherries, strawberry and cassis scents that are well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe and fleshy tannins, good acidity and a solid, slightly saline finish that augurs well for the future.",,RP (90-92)
1717,Henri Boillot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi 2011 is endowed with a nose that welcomes you with open arms: fresh strawberry, Morello and a touch of fruit salad. There is plenty of oak, though it is nicely assimilated, well defined and precise. The palate is crisp and pointed with a silver thread of acidity, fine tension and a nice bitter edge that shaves off a little persistence, but beckons you to take another sip.  ",,RP (90-92)
1718,Henri Boillot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is a slight reduction on the nose of Henri Boillot’ 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, but it opens nicely with citrus peel, mineral and sunflower seeds, gaining in intensity all the time. The palate is fresh and harmonious with a keen thread of acidity. This is well balanced, perhaps a little Puligny in style with a slightly bitter and abrupt finish. Not a bad wine, but not the best from Henri Boillot in this vintage.",,RP (90-92)
1719,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The oak is prominent on the nose of the Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets ’11, although there is sufficient fruit to back it up. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins. It is quite pointed in the mouth with sour cherry, raspberry and spice, leading to a structured and slightly austere finish. I would afford this another 12 to 24 months in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1720,Henri Boillot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Bâtard-Montrachet 2011 from Henri Boillot was the one disappointment from what was otherwise a strong set of wines from this vintage. It does not have the complexity of Olivier Leflaive’s Bâtard with light citrus and orange-blossom aromas that seem a little static. The palate has a reductive note on the entry. The acidity is nicely judged, but there is too much SO2 masking the finish. ",,RP (90-92)
1721,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Frémiets,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Very deep and lucid in color, Henri Boillot’s Volnay 1er Cru Frémiets 2011 has a modern bouquet with succulent red cherries, blackberry and cassis fruit, floral notes developing with time. The palate is very solid with a lot of oak that submerges the fruit toward the dense finish. This feels rather overdone and generic compared to its peers.",,RP (90-92)
1722,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchère,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de la Mouchere has a light bouquet with scents of grass clippings and apple peel, which would benefit from more vigor. The palate is well-balanced with touches of orange peel and tangy marmalade on the lively entry. Thereafter, it just feels a little conservative when you are seeking a tad more tension and complexity. Still, there is good substance here and it may well improve in bottle. Drink now-2020.

1725,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Frémiets,"The 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Les Fremiets seems just a little dull on the nose, like a sulky teenager banned from playing his Marilyn Manson record.

Fine, but perhaps more early drinking than its peers. Drink now-2019.

It is almost Loire-like personality, with subtle wilted-petal scents emerging in the glass. The palate has a crisp citric entry with a fine bead of acidity that lends this Puligny race and tension, while the leesy finish is surfeit with energy. This is a very fine Puligny with breeding and class. Drink now-2024.

1727,Henri Boillot,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Vergelesses Blanc,"The 2010 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Les Vergelesses was raised in 15% new oak that lifts the reticent nose. It has a lovely smooth opening with subtle spicy notes, just a faint touch of nectarine and hazelnut that lend it a Meursault-like allure. This is a very satisfying Savigny that should age well over the next decade. Drink now-2012.

1728,Henri Boillot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2010 Bourgogne Chardonnay has a refined, comparatively complex bouquet when compared to its generic peers, with crisp green dewy apple and a touch of pear. The palate is well-defined with light honeyed tones on the entry, later almond and smoke that segue into a sour lemon on the finish. This is an accomplished generic white Burgundy from Monsieur Boillot. Drink now-2015.

1729,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2009 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrieres displays a refined bouquet that demands coaxing from the glass, reluctantly offering faint scents of orange blossom and lemon thyme. The palate is neutral on the entry with Puligny-like nervosite and a crisp citrus finish, although I am seeking more Genevrieres personality to come through and lend race to this 2009 Meursault. Drink 2014-2020.  ",,RP (90-92)
1730,Henri Boillot,Meursault Village,"The consummate 2009 Meursault Villages has a beautifully poised bouquet infused with grass clippings, Cornice pear and Granny Smith apples. The palate is well-balanced, neutral on the entry but then fanning out with precocious vanilla-tinged, citrus fruit. One could argue that it expresses the winemaking more than a terroir, but that does not detract from a finely crafted Meursault. Drink now-2018.  ",,RP (90-92)
1731,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru En Chevret,"The 2009 Volnay 1er Cru Chevrets has a noticeably deep color. The nose strides across to meet your senses with potent dark plum and mulberry aromas that are assertive but not overpowering, then they soften and become more generous with time. The palate is firm and taut with tart red cherries infused with a touch of soy, though I would have liked a little more Volnay corpulence on the finish. Fine. Drink now-2016. ",,RP (90-92)
1732,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2011 Meursault Les Genevrieres is without question one of the very finest wines aging in the cellar. An exotic, captivating bouquet melds seamlessly into layers of fruit as this deeply textured, indescribably beautiful wine continues to open up in the glass. Layers of flint, crushed rocks, smoke and slate support the breathtaking, crystalline finish. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

Henri Boillot recently finished his move to a new modern cellar in Champ Lins, one of the industrial sections of Meursault. Boillot describes his 2011s as having a bit more richness and better balance of fruit and acidity than the 2010s. Based on what I tasted, it’s hard to argue that point. Boillot seems to be one case where the 2011s have the potential to be better across the board than the 2010s. As is often the case here, the village wines are particularly strong.

1733,Henri Boillot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Along with the Meursault Genevrieres, the 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet is the most impressive wine in Boillot’s cellar today. Rich, honeyed and expansive, the Chevalier covers every corner of the palate with layers of deeply expressive fruit. Juicy apricots, peaches and sweet spices are some of the many notes that open up in the glass. The Chevalier continues to blossom as the fruit fleshes out and the wine gains volume. Frankly, it is hard to move on after tasting this magnificent Burgundy. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

Sweet floral and spiced notes add complexity and depth to the nuanced fruit. In 2011, the Montrachet is all about subtlety, but there is no shortage of character. Readers who like the more refined style of Puligny will find plenty to admire. It will be interesting to see where the 2011 goes over the coming year. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

Henri Boillot turned out a superb set of 2010 reds. Best of all, readers won’t have to shell out a fortune to enjoy them, as a number of the more modestly priced wines far exceed the quality of their respective appellations. Yields came in at 20-22 hectoliters per hectare, a 40% decrease over the more typical production of 35 hectoliters per hectare. Boillot began harvesting on September 29 and ended on October 7, among the latest, if not the latest, to finish picking. Fermentations lasted about 29 days on average. Boillot has augmented his holdings with 5 hectares of vineyards that came online in 2010. I tasted all of these wines at Boillot’s cellars in Volnay. Boillot told me he plans to have his new facility in the Champ Lins section of Meursault fully operational for both whites and reds by summer 2012.

Henri Boillot began harvesting on September 3rd, which he thought was critical in maintaining as much freshness as possible. All of the wines were aged in 350-liter light-toast Francois Freres barrels, with no batonnage. These are some of the most viscerally thrilling, textured 2009s readers will come across. Boillot’s ever-growing collection of negociant wines is reviewed separately. I tasted with Boillot at his Volnay facility, and was thus able to only taste a handful of 2010s, all Domaine (rather than Maison) wines. The 2010s I did taste were exciting and hugely promising.

1807,Henri Boillot,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Boillot 2008 Chambertin – from high up on the cru, protected from hail by the forest, but demanding long hang-time, he reports – is scented with smoky Lapsang tea, peat, and licorice; rich in roasted red meats and black fruits; expansive and palate-staining. There is no place – for now at least, it seems – in this Chambertin for fine floral perfume or elegance; it is a robust, carnal, and densely-fruited rendition. Firmly but finely tannic, its cherry pit, chalk, and stone finishing notes convey a certain austerity but this merely sets off the richness of the whole, and there is an unstoppable torrent of fresh fruit juiciness throughout. This should be worth cellaring for 15-20 years, and would probably best be left in peace for the first half dozen. 

In 2008, Henri Boillot both expanded his domaine and became ambitious qua negociant with Pinot. In the latter capacity, he looks for contracts where he can exercise control over the farming, so that, for example, all of the 2008s – he reports – were cropped at less than 20 hectoliters per hectare and picked very late. Unorthodoxly (for Burgundy, at least) Boillot pressed many of his reds early to let them complete fermentation in barrel. His malos were late but not dramatically so, finishing in August, and most of the wines were bottled in February, a few earlier. (I tasted several 2007 reds from Boillot, but too early-on to adequately assess, and I have not had time to revisit that collection.)

This boasts a sense of lift and energy missing from the other grand crus in the same collection however redoubtable they are (which is very), and along with its density and tannic refinement come saline savor and fresh berry brightness that lend lip-smacking, saliva-inducing status to the finish. I’d expect it to be well worth following for 15-20 years.

This grips and invigorates, its fine-grained but quite noticeable tannin only heightening the effect. I would expect it to be more profound in 4-6 years and to be worth pursuing for 15 or more years in all.

A dynamic exchange of fruit and mineral renders this tongue-tingling, invigorating, and alluring, leaving you licking your lips and salivating uncontrollably. This should grow up to become a profound exemplar of its site, especially if it gains some richness and bass line. I would expect it to be capable of 12-15 years aging.

Firm but fine, well-integrated tannins support this palpably extract-rich, long-finishing wine’s endeavors to stimulate and offer ten or more years’ potential in the bottle. But make no mistake, this is not about tenderness or cajolement.

Overtones of peat and licorice and crushed stone in the finish further enhance a striking similarity with his Chambertin of this vintage. Like most of the other wines in this collection, it boasts tannins both abundant and fine-grained. More formidable for now than loveable, to be sure, its persistent freshness and saliva inducing carnality combine to steer it clear of austerity; instead, it’s long and lean but packed with flavor. I would expect a 15 or more year return from this.

Black tea, white pepper, fresh ginger, and cherry pit lend smokiness, pungency and piquancy to a palate-staining performance. Stony notes and firm tannins lend this an undertone of austerity but it will still prove useful in its youth, and I suspect more so after it’s had 3-5 years in bottle. It should keep well for at least a decade.

This displays cut, brightness, sappy palate fruit presence and tactile impingement of spices, all of which combine with salt, chalk, and peat for a pungent and invigorating finish. Ample tannins here are fine-grained, and I suspect this will be worth following for at least a decade.

1815,Henri Boillot,Volnay 1er Cru Frémiets,"A strikingly Cornas-like nose of raw beef liver and cinnamon-tinged ripe cherry marks the nose of Boillot’s 2008 Volnay Les Fremiets. Firmly tannic but fine-grained, its bright red fruits mingling with peat, clean meatiness, and chalk, this is another handsomely lean, invigorating, and intriguing Boillot Pinot that should keep for a decade or more and will best be given some years in the bottle before opening.  

In 2008, Henri Boillot both expanded his domaine and became ambitious qua negociant with Pinot. In the latter capacity, he looks for contracts where he can exercise control over the farming, so that, for example, all of the 2008s – he reports – were cropped at less than 20 hectoliters per hectare and picked very late.

1816,Henri Boillot,Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,"Bloody red meat and smoked game scents in Boillot’s 2008 Beaune Clos Du Roi make this Pinot one that would cause a vegan to blanch, but a bright blackberry red currant melange rises from the glass and invigorates the palate as well. Smoky, stony, tartly insistent, and residually carnal in finish, this responded well to air, suggesting that it is still somewhat reduced and might become more expressive in short order. I would expect it to be worth following for 8-10 years.

1817,Henri Boillot,Pommard Village,"An addition to his domaine this vintage, Henri Boillot’s 2008 Pommard comes from the cru Clos Blanc just west of the route nationale north of town, but he does not intend to bottle its fruit under that name: since his other domaine addition is in Rugiens, he opines that Clos Blanc should not put on airs in such company! Vivid smoked meat, with blackberry and cinnamon in the nose adumbrate a juicy, and pungently spicy and smoky palate. There is a distinct suffusion of fine-grained tannin which holds back the wine’s otherwise exuberant fruit. But one could plan to follow this for at least 6-8 years.

Leathery notes join the red fruits, game, and lip-smacking mineral salts in a brash and invigorating finish. There is more than enough primary juiciness here to help the wine over its firm and slightly granular tannins. Whether bottles should be held in hopes that these will soften is tough to call, but I would be inclined to anticipate 6-8 useful years.

Its salinity and berry tartness serve for invigoration, while the carnal side of this wine lends it some genuine mystery and depth. There is a certain stiffness and leanness of texture, but not only should this remain fresh for at least a half dozen years, it may well gain richness.

1820,Henri Boillot,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Once again we are confronted with the paradox of a 2007 Corton-Charlemagne (here harvested late in the third week of September at 13% natural alcohol) that its producer proffers after the other, far more expensive grand crus. But rather than try to make sense of this situation, I recommend you just try to get hold of some bottles of the wine! The notion of ""dynamic interchange"" comes up repeatedly in attempting to explain what makes the best 2007 white Burgundies so exciting, and there is no better expression to use here, either. This wine is like a complex and graceful ballet between groups of dancers marked ""fruit,"" ""mineral,"" ""floral,"" and ""animal."" These players include pear, apricot, and lime; chalk, white pepper, salt crustacean shell reduction, chicken broth, and a carpet of flowers: in short, the usual suspects. And here, too, we have soothing and seductive creaminess combined with refreshment, transparency to nuance, and electric energy (even though soothing seduction is not usually delivered by youthful Corton Charlemagne). This possesses all of these features, but to an exceptional degree, as well as a sense of purity and lift somehow perfectly compatible with detonative finishing intensity.

As explained in my report in issue 180, Henri Boillot’s domaine is now legally known by his name rather than that of his father Jean, and is thus eponymous with his negociant business. Furthermore, given what seems to be a stylistic convergence as well as given Boillot's own preference in presenting his wines this year, I have folded together the coverage of these two entities, noting in the text of my notes those wines that come from the domaine. Boillot did not begin picking until the second week in September, harvesting fruit that he reported required only occasional, minimal chaptalization and had higher tartaric than malic acid, in contrast to their proportions in 2008. Since Boillot managed to achieve his ideals of “precision and minerality” even in the ripe 2006 vintage, it will come as no surprise that they have been brilliantly achieved in 2007. A preference for volume of healthy lees rather than their stirring and (as mentioned in my report on his 2006s) the utilization of 350-liter barrels rather than barriques are surely among the factors that permit these wines to marry richness with refreshment and clarity. On the other hand, even the wines of lesser appellation that receive less barrel exposure are still given extended time on their fine lees in tank before bottling, Boillot being a believer that ""time is of the essence"" to great white Burgundy, not in the proverbial sense but rather in that of taking enough if it.

1821,Henri Boillot,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2007 Chevalier-Montrachet – from 50 year old vines – certainly reflects Boillot's claim that ""this is the best terroir there is for white Burgundy."" The floral and musk oil perfume that has characterized this wine in past is almost overwhelmingly heady in the present instance. Decadent lily and narcissus mingle with white peach, quince, pungent green tea, candle wick, sea breeze and chalk dust in a manner that also calls to mind great Vouvray. This hits the palate like an electric shock, setting up a vibratory intensity of mineral, floral, nut oil, and fruit interchange that runs through a matrix so rich in texture it is satiny and almost custardy. The seemingly paradoxical degree to which density and levity, richness and refreshment are combined here is spellbinding. I would anticipate 12-15 years of magnificence for any who are wealthy and lucky enough to latch on to some.

It would be difficult to imagine a more magic carpet or garden of flavors than that which emerges here, shimmering with mineral inflections as well. Here is a wonderful example of the lift as well as (a word Boillot, too uses for this site) the ""tension"" of which Bienvenues – but seldom if ever Batard – is capable. The subtly interactive yet ultimately seemingly indelible cling of mineral, floral, and fruit elements here is ravishing and the combination of textural tenderness with lift and refreshment a handsome tribute to the vintage. I would expect this to be well worth following for a dozen or more years.

1823,Henri Boillot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Boillot 2007 Montrachet (from the Chassagne side) is alluringly scented with honeysuckle, Persian melon, white peach, heliotrope, lily, narcissus, and musk; sets up a vibratory interaction of elements on the palate that is reminiscent of the corresponding Chevalier; and exhibits as well a similarly uncanny alliance of energetic brightness with custardy richness of texture. There is a dimension of clarity and what I can only call a crystalline mineral element in the Boillot Chevalier-Montrachet (but also in a few of the other best wines of that appellation) that I have never experienced from Montrachet itself. But while this wine may be in some sense more opaque than the corresponding Chevalier, its inscrutability is part of its delicious wonder. It's like organ music with all the reverberations of the cathedral, whereas when I grasped for a metaphor to capture the Chevalier, Boillot merely flicked a finger against the rim of his glass, a gesture worth more than any words. I certainly hope and anticipate that this Montrachet will be worth following for a dozen or more years.

Wafting and persistent in florality; invigoratingly tinged by the tartness of fruit skin; suffused with chalk and meat stock-like in its marrowy richness, this taps a deep pool of fruit, culminating in a gloriously tenacious finish.

1825,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Boillot speculates that flint is the efficacious geological element that renders his estate's 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Perrieres so distinctive. Peach and quince make for an effusively ripe, suggestively sweet aroma complimented by peony perfume. Given such a dramatic opening, one might expect a massive onslaught of sheer ripeness on the palate, but while silken-textured and generously expansive, this displays a buoyancy and almost levitating, ethereal lightness of touch, as well as a vibratory interaction of citrus, ripe pit fruit, and liquid floral perfume on the finish. The mineral side of matters vinous – notwithstanding the site's name – is very much sublimated. This epitome of vintage polish, elegance, energy, and luscious refreshment should be worth following for at least half a dozen years. There are 9 barrels of it, and its vines – representing a selection massale from the estate's Clos de la Mouchere – are, amazingly, only in their third year of production.

Reminiscent of the Perrieres in aromas of peach and quince, here allied to iris and suggestions of high-toned herbal and floral distillates, this lights up the palate, with citrus and hints of nettle and white pepper serving for an almost electric invigoration. Yet, ample glycerin makes for a flattering texture and ameliorates any tendency toward sharpness.

Peach, musk melon, and papaya in the nose segue into a sumptuously rich, ripely-fruited palate that incorporates marzipan and honey, yet also a fresh cut of citrus. This would finish more lusciously were it not for a sheer concentration – encompassing citrus zest, peach kernel, vanilla bean, and alkaline minerality – of palate staining bitterness.

As explained in my report in issue 180, Henri Boillot’s domaine is now legally known by his name rather than that of his father Jean, and is thus eponymous with his negociant business. Furthermore, given what seems to be a stylistic convergence as well as given Boillot's own preference in presenting his wines this year, I have folded together the coverage of these two entities, noting in the text of my notes those wines that come from the domaine. Boillot did not begin picking until the second week in September, harvesting fruit that he reported required only occasional, minimal chaptalization and had higher tartaric than malic acid, in contrast to their proportions in 2008. Since Boillot managed to achieve his ideals of “precision and minerality” even in the ripe 2006 vintage, it will come as no surprise that they have been brilliantly achieved in 2007. A preference for volume of healthy lees rather than their stirring and (as mentioned in my report on his 2006s) the utilization of 350-liter barrels rather than barriques are surely among the factors that permit these wines to marry richness with refreshment and clarity. On the other hand, even the wines of lesser appellation that receive less barrel exposure are still given extended time on their fine lees in tank before bottling, Boillot being a believer that ""time is of the essence"" to great white Burgundy, not in the proverbial sense but rather in that of taking enough if it.

1832,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Given a location in the upper reaches of this cru, Boillot opines that his 2007 Meursault Charmes is almost ""more Puligny than Meursault."" White peach, with lightly-toasted almond and hazelnut are wreathed in subtly fragrant flowers on the nose, and follow onto a palate of seductive creaminess combined with buoyancy and refreshment. This is quiet and subtle but impressively long on nut oils, liquid floral essences, and elusive mineral nuances, and is more refined if for now less engaging than the corresponding Poruzots. I would anticipate from it at least 6-8 years of pleasure.

1833,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"From his estate, Boillot's 2007 Meursault Genevrieres evinces low-toned richness and overtly stony, chalky mineral character, which when combined with flavors of fruit pit and citrus rind make for a relative sense of austerity. This is very firm and tucked-in, wearing its high extract palpably on its sleeve. But it is also undeniably deep. There is a combination of proportionality, a flouting of structure, and a sheer stoniness here that make me think of a Greco-Roman temple. Were it not for glyceral richness this would come off as downright austere. It's going to take some time for this to reveal a more winsome side – if indeed it has one – but there is little question in my mind that this will remain formidable for 6-8 years if not longer.

1834,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Cras,"From centenarian vines that Boillot says he suspects are the oldest in their village, his 2007 Meursault Les Cras mysteriously smells of white truffle, quarry dust, and iris. A concentrated stony essence allied to citrus and bitter-sweet liquid floral essences fills the mouth and carries sufficient textural tenderness to keep the mineral dominance here from turning austere. This wine will certainly give terroir fundamentalists a soapbox – or rather, a block of chalk – on which to stand in claiming a seemingly osmotic influence of rock on roots, fruit, wine, and taste. It will serve for half a dozen years or more of fascination, questions of flavor origin aside.

1835,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"From improbably young vines, the Boillot 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Caillerets smells ethereally of floral distillates and citrus oil. Satiny in texture and refreshingly bright on the palate, it suggests an underlying chalkiness that befits its name, as well as a farina-like grain element. The juxtaposition here of active citrus and rather adamant mineral character with textural richness is fascinating – though a rather quiet contrast with the aggressively energetic Folatieres, and this wine's sheer persistence is no less impressive. I would expect it to reward 6-8 years of attention.

Polished, pliable, and subtly creamy on the palate, it introduces a note of caramel that mingles with its mineral, floral, and musky aspects in a buoyantly lingering finish.

1839,Henri Boillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chenevottes,"Like the corresponding Les Chaumees, his 2007 Chassagne-Montrachet Les Chenevottes reflects – according to Boillot – the northerly, high-altitude sector of Chassagne that is most exciting in this vintage. Refinement and a long line characterize this subtly mineral (saline, chalky, crustacean) yet at the same time effusively fruity (peach, apple, and pineapple) wine that finishes with liveliness and cut (promoted in part by a hint of rhubarb). Hints of toasted brioche and almond lend a suggestion of richness. Here too, I fancy the wine being best enjoyed over the next 3-4 years, but perhaps – as Boillot would have me believe – I am underestimating its underlying stamina.  Incidentally, the 40% new wood used here is not at all detectable as such, just as I find myself not thinking about oak in tasting the other wines in this collection.

Citrus, chalk, noble mushrooms and a savor akin to shellfish reduction follow this to a finish of unforgettable length and rarified intensity.

Fresh lime, high-toned herbal distillates, kirsch, and brown spices in the nose lead to a cool, refreshing, herbal, chalky palate impression and a finish of incredible grip: chalky, saline, savory, and with faintly bitter hints of cherry pit. This is very Chablis-like, but in its striking mineral expression and its brightness, more like a super premier cru Chablis than a grand cru.

I anticipate this being worth following for a dozen years, if not longer.

1849,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Representing a mere 5 barrels, the Boillot 2006 Meursault Perrieres smells brightly of lemon, lily-of-the-valley, buddleia, and fresh pear, and displays more delicacy and lift than the corresponding Charmes. With an irresistible sweet, saline savor and subtle suggestions of wet stone, it delivers flowers and refreshing citrus all the way through a long, lively, airy, yet palate-staining finish. This terrific advertisement for the grand cru virtues of Perrieres should repay 7-9 years- cellaring, if not more. Boillot says the plot in question is impeccably-tended, but the vines are relatively young.

1850,Henri Boillot,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Coming from its Criots and Bienvenues, Boillot's 2006 Batard-Montrachet had two very difficult acts to follow. The dominant themes here are ripe peaches, brown spices, and nut oils, imbedded in a palpably dense and relatively firm-feeling palate, and clinging tenaciously with a bitter-sweet peach, peach kernel, and pungent spice. While impressive, this does not display the uncanny balance or flavor interplay of its grand cru siblings, and leaves behind a bit of heat. But there may well be more here than met my nose and palate on the occasion in question. And I can certainly imagine this being worth at least 6-8 years of cellaring.

1851,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Poruzots,"The Boillot 2006 Meursault Poruzots delivers alluring aromas of pear nectar, lily, and fresh lime. Honeyed in richness yet refreshingly bright and possessed of deep nuttiness and a saline savory that really draws out one's saliva, this persistently juicy, bitter-sweet and fascinatingly mineral Meursault really displays the class and complexity of its origins, and should replay 5-7 years-cellaring.

1852,Henri Boillot,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Boillot 2006 Montrachet (from the Chassagne side) displays a musky, peachy, decadently floral nose; a subtly oily, deep, piquantly nutty, richly ripe yet at the same time brightly citric palate; and resonant finish. This enveloping wine should stand up to at least 6-8 years of bottle age, and may well develop more nuance along the way. But it is not on a level with the best grand crus in this collection, nor do I find it easy to imagining it achieving such heights.

1853,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"From relatively young vines, the Boillot 2006 Puligny-Montrachet Les Caillerets smells of musky narcissus and sharp fresh lemon. Bright and high-toned, with a chalky mineral sense on the palate, this spare, bright wine penetrates with rapier sharpness and intensity, though it's anything but charming, and evinces a bit of finishing warmth. My suspicion is that I caught up with it on an uncooperative day. But even so, the987 focus and concentration here are formidable, and I suspect this should repay at least 6-8 years in the cellar.

1854,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"From a parcel near the Puligny line, Boillot's 2006 Meursault Charmes features white peach and persimmon; a pithier nuttiness and more adamant stoniness than one normally associates with this cru; and a formidably concentrated finish, enlivened by notes of fresh lime. A flattering silken texture helps lend some charm, but I suspect there is more here than met my nose and palate on a single occasion, and I expect this will justify 5-7 years- cellaring as well.

1855,Henri Boillot,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Henri Boillot's 2006 Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles displays a depth and grip that go well beyond the other wines in his collection. Aromas of ripe peach and nectarine, apple blossom, lemon, and a bitter, cyanic note introduce the bitter-sweet yet refreshingly citric themes on a peachy, lemony, nutty palate. An undertone of chalky minerality is unmistakable, leading into a long finish poised between fruit generosity and adamant minerality. The toasted notes of 50% new wood are evident throughout, but without seeming at all out of place.

Henri Boillot's domaine will now be known by his name rather than that of his father Jean, and will thus be eponymous with his ambitious and burgeoning negociant collection. But precisely because the latter line-up is so lengthy, and because certain differences in approach (and certainly a different cellar environment) apply to each of Boillot's businesses, I have treated his negociant wines under a separate heading. Boillot began harvesting five days ahead of the ban de vendange, and the precautions he took to preserve freshness in his 2006 wines overlap with those he has taken generally in an attempt to ward off premature oxidation. He performed no batonnage, and planned to monitor the assembled wines in tank over an extended period. These domaine wines were less generous - almost severe - the day I tasted, when compared with the corresponding negociant wines, perhaps in part due to the former having been racked to tank less than three weeks prior.

1856,Henri Boillot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Cras,"The Boillot 2006 Meursault Les Cras (5 barrels from ancient and decrepit vines) smells of toasted almond, grapefruit rind, bitterly pungent herbs, and peach kernel. Glossy in texture and refreshingly citric through faintly bitter, this finishes with fresh white peach and grapefruit helping to allay its strikingly austere sense of stoniness and its bitter, pointed concentration of citrus oils and fruit pits. This remarkably dynamic, palate-staining Meursault should reward 5-6 years of cellaring.

Smoky toasted nuts lend depth to this substantial, smoothly-textured Chassagne, which finishes with exuberant and invigorating intensity of peach skin, grapefruit with its zest, and salt, though long on nuts and chalk, too. This should stand up well to at least 4-5 years in bottle.

The finish here really breaks down the door and rushes one's defenses, generating little heat, but taking no prisoners.

Anything this lacks in charm or verve vis a vis the Les Chaumees, it gains in sheer density and finishing intensity. It should be worth following for 4-5 years.

It should be worth following for at least 3-4 years, and since there are 30 barrels, it should not be inaccessible in the marketplace.

It offers candied apples, apricots, mangoes, earth, allspice, and dried honey flavors.  This medium-to-full-bodied and lavishly textured wine is surprisingly polished and stylish given its sur-maturite characteristics.  Projected maturity: now-2004.

1936,Arnaud Ente,Bourgogne Blanc,"Produced entirely in two year old barrels, Boillot's 1997 Bourgogne Blanc exhibits a delightful sweet pear and anise-infused nose.  Half of the must used to craft this wine is declassified St.  Romain (""it brings minerality,"" says Boillot), and the balance is from the Meursault commune (""for its fat"").  The resulting offering is extremely impressive, with an expressive, oily-textured, fresh, and well-balanced personality.  Thick layers of white fruits verging on sur-maturite are intermingled with hints of gravel in its flavor profile.  I wish all the generic Bourgognes were this good!

It is very ripe (jammy but focused), medium-to-full-bodied, chewy-textured, and packed with grapes, plums, cherries, and boysenberries. This well-defined wine should be at its best between 1999 and 2006.

If the wines I tasted out of the assembling tanks reflect what ultimately is bottled (I have no tasting experience comparing both pre- and post-bottling wines from Domaine Jean Boillot) then Henri Boillot will most certainly have crafted three outstanding Volnays.

The 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots-du-Milieu from Arnaud Ente has a very distinctive, tertiary and damp undergrowth-scented bouquet that implies considerable stem addition. It does not possess the complexity of the Clos des Chênes from Château de Meursault and evolves a more Pommard set of aromatics rather than Volnaysian. The palate is superb! Medium-bodied, anachronistic in style with stems seeming to ""float"" around the rustic red fruit, but stepping back, you have to appreciate the balance and personality here; the effortlessness of this Volnay that should give pleasure over the next decade.

The bouquet comes racing out of the blocks with smoke and walnut scents, here tinctured with orange blossom, gaining intensity all the time in the glass. The palate has a hint of white peach on the entry. It is beautifully balanced and full of energy from start to spice-tinged finish. This is just an outstanding contribution to the vintage. ",,RP 92

Pale ruby in color, the Volnay Santenots-du-Milieu 2011 has a rather smudged nose: touches of cranberry and bergamot, quite stemmy and a little raw. The palate is sharp and feels rather hard. There is good acidity, but the finish is stiff and obdurate. I find this too severe for a Volnay, especially a Santenots. ",,RP 92
1949,Arnaud Ente,Meursault La Seve du Clos,"Arguably the finest wine in this lineup, the 2010 Meursault La Seve du Clos is simply striking in its beauty. This is a more intense, piercing style than the Goutte d’Or. Bright flowers, pears, oyster shells, crushed rocks and slate are all layered into this tightly wound, focused Meursault. Vibrant saline notes frame the long finish. In 2010, La Seve du Clos is pure class. The style is all about energy, tension and length. It is super-impressive. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

Citricity (in the guise of fresh grapefruit and lime) and stony, chalky minerality are present here too, as in Ente's other 2007s, but now with a scintillating, shimmering interaction of elements such as characterizes so many of the best wines of this vintage. This finishes with not only the vigor of an elegant mineral-fruit dynamic, but with a memorably bitter-sweet cling of liquid floral perfume, citrus oils, and smoke. This sort of resonant intensity in a wine of such modest alcohol is in itself noteworthy, not to mention the depths of complexity on exhibit here. I would expect it to be worth following for at least a decade. 

Arnaud Ente began picking September 2, but although he is nearly always a partisan of early harvest, this one was spread out over nearly two weeks to optimize the aggregation of clarity and sufficient ripeness. That said, high acidity – including a sizeable share of malic acid – remained a common denominator and higher than in 2004 because, in Ente's words, ""there was no heat during the summer to burn it off."" His malo-lactic fermentations, however, were finished already in mid-winter. Natural alcohol levels were low – predictably, given both the vintage and Ente's strategy and preferences – not exceeding 12.5%, and only the Aliogte was chaptalized. For Ente, vintages without hot summer weather are simply the more interesting and enjoyable, thanks in large part precisely to their higher acidity and lower alcohol.

A lovely counterpoint between bright citrus and salt on the one hand and toasted grains and nuts with a hint of honey on the other lends this a distinctive dynamic and – for all of its overtly mineral cast – considerable charm. Zesty, invigorating, and palpably chalky in its long finish, this promises future richness and a good half dozen years of interest.

1967,Arnaud Ente,Meursault Clos des Ambres,"Lime and yellow plum in the nose of Ente's 2007 Meursault Clos des Ambres lead to a palate impression at once austere and adamantly mineral, but also refreshingly bright and saliva-inducing. Toasted almond and sunflower seed along with pungent citrus rind and a hint of smoke are suggested in the bright, treble finish of this wine that some tasters are apt to consider ""Meursault Lite"" or too lean a cut of its appellation, while others will relish its athletic trimness and energy. I suspect those who gravitate toward this wine will enjoy it for 4-6 years. 

Arnaud Ente began picking September 2, but although he is nearly always a partisan of early harvest, this one was spread out over nearly two weeks to optimize the aggregation of clarity and sufficient ripeness. That said, high acidity – including a sizeable share of malic acid – remained a common denominator and higher than in 2004 because, in Ente's words, ""there was no heat during the summer to burn it off.""

1968,Arnaud Ente,Meursault Village,"A complementary blending of fruit from Ormeau and Casse-Tete, Ente’s 2007 Meursault evinces lemon, herbs, salt, and chalk, but with a striking shrimp shell reduction-like savor. Lean but refreshing and texturally polished, this displays tart peach, plum, and citrus that compliment its mineral diversity in a lingering finish. I suspect it will take on some richness in another year or two and be worth employing for 4-5 years.

1969,Arnaud Ente,Bourgogne Blanc,"The Ente 2007 Bourgogne prominently features fresh lemon, grapefruit, and herbs, but while texturally spare, is more luscious than that description or the wine's borderline sense of ripeness might suggest. Like the corresponding Aligote – but in a more winsome context – this loads the palate with lasting high-toned herbal essences and residues of salt and chalk, for a metaphorically cool mineral bath. This epitome of its vintage – at least as Ente perceives it – should prove versatile over the next 2-3 years.

1971,Arnaud Ente,Meursault La Seve du Clos,"From a tiny parcel in the Ormeau, most of whose vines were planted immediately after phylloxera, Ente’s 2006 Meursault Le Seve du Clos is as exciting as that description would lead one to hope. Meaty, saline, savory, nobly fungal, and chalky characteristics dominate even in the aroma, and if I had tasted this truly blind, only the refreshing citricity and notes of milled grain, I suspect, would have kept me from imaging Pinot Noir. This Meursault displays the mineral depth of the ocean and the grip of the proverbial iron fist in the velvet glove. Dense, firm, yet both glycerin-rich and refreshing clear, it finish that rings out while leaving your palate wrung out! If this does not make old bones, few if any other Meursault are likely to do so. Incidentally, one of the three barrels here was new, making for the highest percentage of any wine at the domaine.

Ente began picking September 13, finishing in six days. The result is wines of consistent clarity and refreshment, as well as full of nuances that call forth a mineral vocabulary. Use of demi-muids rather than barriques to raise many of the wines here helps ward off any overt woodiness. Eighty percent of Ente’s wine is exported, most of that to the U.S. and U.K.

1972,Arnaud Ente,Meursault Les Petits Charrons,"A portion of old, low yielding vines and very low yields appear to me what makes it reasonable that Ente’s 2006 Meursault Les Petits Charrons – a wine of village ranking – be served after his Gouttes d’Or premier cru. Once again, we have an understated (yet striking) wine, featuring “cool” herbal, white peach, and citrus characteristics, in this instanced with intriguing hints of mushroom stock, wet stone, and a savory, saline, umami-rich note that – when allied to the citrus – makes for a positively Pavlovian finish. The texture here is subtly oily yet the overall impression is sleek and fleet-footed. This should be fascinating for follow for at least 5-7 years.

Bitter-sweet and piquant notes of iris, toasted nuts, buckwheat, lime zest, pit fruits with their pits make for a relatively austere set of flavors, but ones that finish with formidable persistence and intriguing interaction. There is a faint hint of heat, tending to confirm Ente’s conviction that Puligny is inherently more sensitive to over-ripeness.

Toasted nuts and hints of white pepper make for a piquancy that nicely compliments the wines bracing lemon and grapefruit, and salinity and chalkiness leave the palate coated and invigorated. Musky, bitter-sweet inner-mouth suggestions of narcissus and iris, and a hint of lanolin offer further intrigue. This is not especially rich but it is richly rewarding.

2053,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Spatlese,"Effusively scented with peony and heliotrope; quince, white peach, and Persian melon; as well as ethereal herbal distillates, the Muller 2010 Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese – sole wine so-labeled in this year’s collection, surprisingly – delivers persistent inner-mouth perfume allied to an uncanny sense of lift and buoyancy as well as transparency of its silken, decadently musky and floral nectar to salt and stone. It’s hard to imagine a much greater contrast – within the parameters of this estate – than that between the present extraordinary as well as extraordinarily rarified wine and its severe, almost strident Braune Kupp counterpart. “If you looked at the analysis of this,” says Muller (but without offering it for inspection), “you simply wouldn’t believe that you could be tasting what you’re tasting.” Look for this to remain glorious for at least three decades.  

Egon Muller scored a collection of striking successes in 2010, albeit at the price of tiny yields, comparable, he notes, to those of hail- and botrytis-ravaged 2006. This paucity of juice, combined with high ripeness, is reflected in the, for this estate, very surprising presence of only one Scharzhofberger each of Pradikat Kabinett and Spatlese, consisting of an amalgamation of several tiny lots. Nor need collectors fret about the identity of A.P. #s ... save when it comes to Trockenbeerenauslese, since a second one of those was fermenting at the time of my visit. (The 2009 vintage T.B.A. reviewed in Issue 192 now carries this year’s A.P. #11 and achieved at auction last September a record price of 5300 Euros for 750 ml.) Picking began October 14, “already with beautiful botrytis,” Muller notes, and was finished before the end of the month to respect the crew’s All Saint’s holiday weekend and because – although he indicates that there was negligible rain here at the beginning of November – Muller perceived scant likely benefit to postponing passes on an already extremely light-bearing vineyard. “We picked out what little botrytis-free fruit there was intermittently through the course of the harvest,” he adds, “and de-acidified musts selectively as seemed warranted, independent of the quality (i.e. Pradikat) level in question.”

2054,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Auslese,"Muller’s 2010 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese offers a similarly striking contrast with its counterpart from the Braune Kupp to that displayed between the corresponding Spatlesen, since in the present wine we have an elixir of remarkable levity, refinement, and polished textural allure. What’s more, the flavors now shift toward honey, white raisin, salted caramel, and quince preserves, unabashedly exhibiting these grapes’ noble botrytization. And even despite what I am sure are enormously high acids, these act only as hidden, energizing springs until the finish kicks in with overt citricity that help leaven and balance the wines liqueur-like texture and sweetness. I think we can safely presume a quarter-century’s strong performance here. This wine was in effect a byproduct, says Muller, having been culled from the corresponding gold capsule Auslesen rather than the other way around.

2055,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Kabinett,"Accumulated from several small lots, and constituting, exceptionally, the sole Egon Muller wine of its vintage and Pradikat, his 2010 Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett delivers zesty, refreshing lemon and lime underlain by wet stone and suffused with mouthwatering salinity. The high extract is palpable as stuffing, and the sense of sweetness very restrained. It is more formidable than winsome, and definitely in keeping with Muller’s insistence that regardless of legal definitions or of how others conceive that term, when he puts “Kabinett” on a label he’s thinking “Cabinet” in the solely approbative pre-1971 sense of a prime exemplar of its grape and site not marked by botrytis or pronounced sweetness. This ought to perform well for at least a decade and is likely to become more interesting.

2056,Egon Muller,Riesling Scharzhof,"Scents of lemon, lime, kirsch distillate along with a sweaty, brackish hint in Muller’s 2010 Riesling Scharzhof lead into a bright, invigoratingly tart palate impression with a distinctly malic edge of apple skin. Hints of brown spice add to the finishing stimulation, and true to its author’s intentions, this comes off as only very slightly sweet. I would plan to enjoy it over the next 3-5 years.  

Egon Muller scored a collection of striking successes in 2010, albeit at the price of tiny yields, comparable, he notes, to those of hail- and botrytis-ravaged 2006. This paucity of juice, combined with high ripeness, is reflected in the, for this estate, very surprising presence of only one Scharzhofberger each of Pradikat Kabinett and Spatlese, consisting of an amalgamation of several tiny lots. Nor need collectors fret about the identity of A.P. #s ... save when it comes to Trockenbeerenauslese, since a second one of those was fermenting at the time of my visit.

2057,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese,"Esszencia-like in its alliance of near-gelatinous, creamy viscosity with near-weightlessness as well as its prominent themes of apricot and peach preserves, the Muller 2009 Scharzhofberger Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese – not slated for bottling before spring of 2011 – is undeniably embryonic, but at the same time already stunningly and intriguingly complex. Suggestions of roasted black truffle and concentrated meat stock and crustacean shell; lily-like perfume that liquefies into a slick, mouth-quickening essence; and an entire cabinet of brown spices help generate a show of inexhaustibly savory potential, irresistible seduction, and inexplicable mystery, to say nothing of nearly indelible persistence and indefatigable potential over the next half century and beyond.

Muller draws parallels with 1971, 1990, and 1997, while noting that his 2009s are higher in acidity than the estate's sensational 1997s. A comparison with 2007 also strikes me as inevitable, and I personally take Muller's self-deprecating remark that ""in 2009 we tried to rectify certain failures of 2007"" with a large grain of tartrate salt. Asked to clarify, he referred to his having in that year been less perseverant or conscientious (""konsequent"") in the search for berries of top Auslese or T.B.A.-grade. (To whatever extent that was true of 2007, Muller certainly fooled me!) This year's litany of individual Kabinett bottlings represents a volume approximately equal to that of the collective Spatlesen; and despite Muller's decision to bottle his entire 2009 collection later than usual, one of those Kabinetts – an A.P. #2, and his sole lot of this vintage that represents an amalgamation of two fuders – had already been shipped from the winery without remainder by the time I visited in September. (As ill luck would have it, I learned too late to remedy this deficiency by press time that precisely this wine – at a suggested retail price of $60 – was the Kabinett being sold by Muller's national U.S. agent.)

Wafting, buddleia-like floral perfume and high-toned distillate-like herbal essences add the enticement of this silken-textured, almost weightlessly-delicate essence of Scharzhofberg. Saline and cyanic fruit pit accents add further invigoration and counterpoint that runs through a richly-clinging and saliva-inducing finish.

2060,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"The auctioned Muller 2009 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule positively prickles, tweaking the nose with its pungently spicy, zesty, high-toned distillate-like intensity. Candied citrus rind, peach preserves, caramel, and white raisin inform a performance more intensely-concentrated and viscous than the corresponding Braune Kupp, but to me less mysteriously alluring and intriguing. Salted caramel, white raisin, and peach preserves inform a nearly ineradicable though for now – in a departure from the rest of the present collection – somewhat superficially sweet finish. In fairness both to this wine and my judgment (to the extent that some will understandably be tempted to question it), we have here an instance of considerable baby fat, almost unruly youthful exemplification of botrytis, and an embryonic wine whose underlying structure – while almost certainly in place – as well as whose future nature, are for now largely inscrutable. One thing certain is that even were this Riesling elixir – as would not be surprising – to goes into hibernation for a decade or more, it can be counted on for vitality 40 years from now.

While Egon Muller harvested into November, he noted that the best results were mostly achieved before that, with ""the Spatlesen and Auslesen picked in the early passes, which captured what there was of botrytis"" on his vineyards, and the collection he fielded from 2009 is not merely notable for the extraordinary quality of select cuvees, but also for its outstanding consistency. Muller draws parallels with 1971, 1990, and 1997, while noting that his 2009s are higher in acidity than the estate's sensational 1997s. A comparison with 2007 also strikes me as inevitable, and I personally take Muller's self-deprecating remark that ""in 2009 we tried to rectify certain failures of 2007"" with a large grain of tartrate salt. Asked to clarify, he referred to his having in that year been less perseverant or conscientious (""konsequent"") in the search for berries of top Auslese or T.B.A.-grade. (To whatever extent that was true of 2007, Muller certainly fooled me!) This year's litany of individual Kabinett bottlings represents a volume approximately equal to that of the collective Spatlesen; and despite Muller's decision to bottle his entire 2009 collection later than usual, one of those Kabinetts – an A.P. #2, and his sole lot of this vintage that represents an amalgamation of two fuders – had already been shipped from the winery without remainder by the time I visited in September. (As ill luck would have it, I learned too late to remedy this deficiency by press time that precisely this wine – at a suggested retail price of $60 – was the Kabinett being sold by Muller's national U.S. agent.) This year's Auslesen, notes Muller, tend to each represent the picking of one particular day from across numerous parcels. (As always, Muller wines from his monopole Braune Kupp are bottled under the Le Gallais label, but in my reports and our database, we do not treat Le Gallais as an independent estate, since it and the Scharzhof have for more than half a century operated as one.)

2068,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A P #18,"Peach and quince preserves in the Muller 2009 Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A.P. #18 inform a sleek, subtly oily, honey-glazed, and lusciously-ripe yet at the same time subtly and mouthwateringly saline palate. Hints of white raisin and musk emerge to underscore the wine's advanced sense of ripeness, but this displays marginally less striking lift or sheer length today than its immediate siblings. That said, it is sure to perform deliciously over at least a 15-20 years.

Juicy, invigorating, and buoyant, this is poised and polished but also more pointed than the corresponding A.P. #6, and penetrates with well-judged sweetness in a finish that supplies ample salt and stone mineral counterpoint. I expect it will perform handsomely for at least the next 15 years.

2070,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett A P #6,"White peach and fig with a faintly fusil hint inform a subtly creamy, delicate, judiciously sweet Muller 2009 Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett A.P. #6 that conveys a striking contrast to its Braune Kupp cousin. Here, the vigor, clarity, and interactive complexity of the latter is replace by soft edges and a sense of satisfying, subtle blurring of lines between fruit; inner-mouth honeysuckle-like floral perfume; and a persistently mouth-coating, sea water-like sense of saline and alkaline mineral broth. I would pick this to show best over the next decade though I am sure it will last beyond then.

2071,Egon Muller,Riesling Scharzhof,"Conveying sappy impressions of pear and cherry cider, the Muller 2009 Riesling Scharzhof deploys its generous juiciness on a silken-textured, buoyant stage and without any impression of superficial sweetness. There is a sense of energy and of stone-fruit interplay as well as a sheer persistence to the finish here that I have seldom experienced with this basic Scharzhof bottling (which is sourced from a variety of vineyards, but especially from sites in Saarburg). It ought to remain delightful for at least 4-5 years.

2072,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"The Muller 2008 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule exudes ethereal aromas of honey, white raisin, gardenia, heliotrope, white peach preserves, and marzipan. Rich and satiny yet sleek and enormously penetrating on the palate, it suggests incipient caramelization, but is largely given over to sheer concentration of pit fruit essences drenched in honey and shot through to a remarkable degree with saline, stony, and crystalline suggestions of things non-living. The almost raucous dynamic and baroque complexity of the corresponding Wiltinger contrasts sharply with the harmonious, serene, high-toned personality and heavenly levity on display here. In fact, it is hard to imagine a much more impressive example of sheer purity of noble botrytis, even if one were to ratchet up must weight and Pradikat. At the same time, it's hard to imagine a much more dramatic example of the inherent ability of the Scharzhofberg to pack loads of botrytis yet retain its sheer purity of fruit, its elegance, and its sensibly discernible vineyard identity. As Muller points out, this extraordinary elixir was possible only by dint of fanatically rigorous selection across nearly the entire range of his Scharzhofberg parcels. It should certainly outlive any American reading this who is legally allowed - even if, like the vast majority of us, unable - to purchase it.

Egon Muller finds merit in the comparison of 2008 with 1988 - or perhaps, as I suggested of his collection specifically, to 1969, a vintage with which, as he pointed out, the youthful 1988s were frequently compared. He notes that -half the 2008 harvest became Kabinett, and most of the rest Q.b.A.- but most of these Kabinetts would have been classified a grade higher in the, for its time, -classic Spatlese vintage- of 1988. That said, Muller and his team - who, unlike most of their Saar neighbors in search of a balance of dry and nobly sweet wines, do not spray against botrytis in summer - managed some superb selective harvesting this year, for which, he relates -the last week in October was the best time. At the end of October, it rained a bit again, and the botrytis was no longer so good. And that's why there is so little nobly sweet wine this year.- Apropos Kabinett, Muller takes a dim view of creeping residual sugar in wines so-labeled - confessing that he did not prove immune to that temptation - and is now bottling in the 30-35 gram range. He is always at pains to point out that he views and styles such wines in the manner traditionally associated with so-called Naturwein rather than in a manner especially associated with capital--K- Kabinett. Nonetheless, 2008 is one vintage where the Muller Kabinett bottlings exhibit precisely the delicacy that many of us consider the essence of that post-1971 category. For the most part, these 2008s - which, as a group, constitute a summit of their vintage - were bottled significantly later than the estate norm.

2073,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A P #8,"The 2008 Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A.P. #8 - unlike the corresponding A.P. #4 - represents a single cask rather than an assemblage, but Muller elected this year not to auction a Spatlese. Apple blossom, linden, and rowan make for an unforgettable arboreal bouquet, complimented by pear, white peach, and quince on a delicate, yet richly-textured, silken palate. The inner-mouth floral profusion here is contrasted with a palpable sense of crushed stone and saline mineral residue that however in no way weighs down the buoyancy or obscures the air-dried delicacy and transparency of the wine's ripe, northerly orchard fruits. Hints of vanilla and botrytis honey emerge on the long, ravishingly refreshing, needle-nosed, and dynamically complex finish. This is the most musical of Muller's 2008s as well as among the most refined and memorable wines of its vintage. I suspect it will be well worth following for a quarter century, though no owner should resist the temptation to savor some now.

2074,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Auslese,"The Muller 2008 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese - their sole bottling of -non-gold capsule- Auslese (so reference to its A.P.# - 5 - is superfluous), and representing only one small lot - offers an amazing alliance of richness and energy. -Grilled peach and apricot laced with vanilla cream and caramel- may sound like a recipe for a decadent, soothing desert. It is, and this wine is. But at the same time, there are complex accents of blond tobacco, brown spices, and peat, along with a surprisingly firm texture, and a lively sense of refreshment that seems to come out of nowhere, levitating the flavors and driving them into a prodigious finish in which notes of peach kernel, singed fruit skin, and wet stone provide dynamic counterpoint. This too should be worth cellaring for three or more decades.

Wafting in its delicacy and less aggressive in its expression of acids or phenolic pungency than the corresponding Kabinetts, this mingles subtle salinity nut oils and luscious, almost palpably pulpy tropical fruit on a creamy palate Suggestions of peony and lily perfume perfectly compliment the wine's seductive, ethereal personality and become more intense as CO2 and fermentative notes (with some not-so-gentle assistance on my part) dissipate from the glass.

2076,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Kabinett #3,"Bottled earlier than its stable mates, the Muller 2008 Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett A.P. #3 smells of sea breezes and shrimp shell reduction in a manner that accentuates the already mineral thrust of the corresponding A.P. #6. Nor is a classic wet stone suggestion missing here either. Muller thinks the measurably remarkably high dry extract levels of the 2008s have some significance in terms of flavor, and it's certainly hard to deny that this Kabinett - while delicate, invigorating, and supremely refreshing - also seems as though you could strain it through your teeth and come up with a shimmering mineral residue. Furthermore, something other than residual sugar is manifestly buffering out and balancing the high acidity. don't look for charm here, and above all not for the laid-back, soothing side 2008 can sometimes show. This wine will stiffen your spine even as it invigorates your palate and challenges your imagination. I'd plan to follow some for at least a dozen years.

2077,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett A P #7,"Representing his auction lot at this Pradikat level, Muller's 2008 Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett A.P. #7 is initially a bit shrouded by yeasty, fermentative aromas, but largely clears to reveal another aromatic exhibition of considerable mineral mystery as well as predictably citrus and pit fruit essences. This is practically explosive on the palate, showering it with vividly fresh white peach and yellow plum while virtually electrically charging it with white currant and citrus. Mineral complications are more sublimated on the nose and mid-palate here than in this year's other two Scharzhofberger Kabinetts, but there is an almost reverberative intensity to the finish that points in a mineral direction. I would expect this to be worth following for 12-15 years and to eventually reward the confidence that Muller and his cellar master showed in it by choosing it as the auction cuvee.

2079,Egon Muller,Riesling Scharzhof,"Grapefruit and white peach along with refreshing, cool, herbal notes dominate the generic Muller 2008 Riesling Scharzhof, which incorporates fruit from the estate's considerable, steep Saarburg vineyards. This finishes with admirable refreshment and restrained sweetness, allying in the best vintage manner a sense of underlying extract with levity. I would plan to enjoy it over the next 2-3 years.  

Egon Muller finds merit in the comparison of 2008 with 1988 - or perhaps, as I suggested of his collection specifically, to 1969, a vintage with which, as he pointed out, the youthful 1988s were frequently compared. He notes that -half the 2008 harvest became Kabinett, and most of the rest Q.b.A.- but most of these Kabinetts would have been classified a grade higher in the, for its time, -classic Spatlese vintage- of 1988. That said, Muller and his team - who, unlike most of their Saar neighbors in search of a balance of dry and nobly sweet wines, do not spray against botrytis in summer - managed some superb selective harvesting this year, for which, he relates -the last week in October was the best time. At the end of October, it rained a bit again, and the botrytis was no longer so good. And that's why there is so little nobly sweet wine this year.- Apropos Kabinett, Muller takes a dim view of creeping residual sugar in wines so-labeled - confessing that he did not prove immune to that temptation - and is now bottling in the 30-35 gram range.

2080,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese A P #12,"Quince and yellow plum preserves, honey and brown spices inform the nose of the auctioned 2007 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese A.P. #12. Notes of truffle and Tokaji-like smokiness emerge with airing, emphasizing the nobly rotten side of a wine both palpably dense and almost weightlessly buoyant. Sappy plum paste and luscious yet refreshing pineapple mingle with honey and caramel on a creamy rich palate, engendering a confectionary, almost taffy-like impression, yet there is persistent invigoration and refreshment – not to mention seduction – in this wine’s amazingly long finish as well. I am confident (some of) you will still be awed by this in 40 years. 

Egon Muller compares his 2007s with the wines of 1997, which here displayed  exceptional purity and advanced, largely noble rot-free ripeness, although the total number of bottlings in 2007 was significantly smaller, and the number of Auslesen alone this year three times greater. (I missed tasting one Spatlese, A.P. #6 that sold out early on, and I have not yet tasted this year’s Trockenbeerenauslese, which hadn’t even finished fermenting on the occasion when I tasted Muller’s other 2007s.)

2081,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule,"Candied lemon, honey, peach preserves, musk, and truffle present themselves with pungently penetrating, distillate-like concentration on the nose of the 2007 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Gold Capsule (A.P. #14), which was assembled from selective pickings in numerous parcels. A confectionary impression much like that of the corresponding Braune Kupp is accentuated by a rather Eiswein-like suggestion of vanilla icing. This is even more enveloping and rich, as well as much more homogeneous than that Kupp, and its phenomenally long finish seems to blanket the palate, to the slight detriment of complexity. Here is a wine worth at least a half century’s cellaring, and any lucky to have bid high enough for it would be well advised not to revisit a bottle for at least 15 years.

Melon and quince are garlanded with lily and narcissus, while mineral savor and musky, pheromone-like character lend genuine mystery as well as allure. Hazelnut and almond paste add richness and depth to a finish that for all of its striking richness remains satisfyingly succulent and refreshing. I anticipate more than three decades of seduction await those lucky (and wealthy) enough to acquire some of this at a sufficiently young (human!) age.

Musk, honey, and caramel mingle on its creamy, rich palate, and as with this year’s Braune Kupp Spatlese, there is a wealth of saline, savory mineral nuance here, not to mention a wafting persistence of floral perfume. We are certainly far from the tartly fresh orchard fruits or the citrus of so many 2007s here, but the wine still preserves a sense of refreshment in its long, brown spice- and toasted nut-inflected finish. Expect this beauty to be worth following for a quarter century.

The floral notes waft all the way through while browned butter and savory salinity compliment an intense concentration of pit fruit essences. Subtle oiliness of texture and the tart chew of fruit skin offer further counterpoint in a finish of formidable penetration and purity that only just misses the mystery and interplay of the auction Spatlese.

A slightly jarring note is engendered by the concentration of acidity here coupled with obvious botrytization, and I expect this will taste more knitted in another year, but there is the complexity and energy not only for a mesmerizing finish but for three decades or more of fascination.

Toasted almond and fruit pit bitterness; stone, chalk, and salt; are balanced – as the wine’s fruit is enhanced – by impeccably judged, discreet residual sugar, and this finishes with impressive persistence.

Bartlett pear and nut oils lead to a creamy yet delicate and refreshing palate, its fruit accented by salted, toasted nuts, browned butter, and wet stone, all of which carry into a lusciously long finish. As this took on air, it gained in transparency to mineral nuances and its sense of delicacy became increasingly striking.

Caramelized peach, maracuja, Persian melon, grilled pineapple, grapefruit, and vanilla inform the nose and a luscious, voluminous palate. The combination of purity, refinement, and wafting florality, vanilla cream richness and silkiness with bright, refreshing citricity and sheer wet stone slate suggests an energized and levitated version of the 1975s (which, admittedly, I first tasted only in 1981, and prior to my gaining serious expertise in German wine). A very faint note of white raisin emerges from the sweetly-scented empty glass. This remarkable elixir will no doubt last for a half century or longer. 

Despite the challenges of hail (which struck the Scharzhofberg but not the Braune Kupp) and rampant ripening and botrytis, Egon Muller has turned out a 2006 collection whose quality potential he says can be compared (as he did 2005’s) with 1976, the vintage his father believed to have been the finest of his time. “This was a vintage with massive botrytis,” Muller observes, “yet when you taste the wines today, you are amazed at how elegant and refreshing they are.” (Note: stellar quality was achieved in 1976 almost exclusively on the Saar, not in Germany’s other Riesling-growing regions.) Muller also draws comparison between the styles of 2006 and 1999, although the latter vintage involved a great deal of selection and resulted in no fewer than 37 different bottlings. “Surprisingly,” he says, “in 2006 we did very, very little selection. We played around a bit here and there, but we realized very quickly that the must weights were soaring, and haste in the vineyards and the cellar was essential. We did harvest a very small amount of Trockenbeerenauslese – we wanted to do that. But a lot more would have been possible had there been the time.”

An intense, nearly sharp citricity, when combined with the dried fruits, gives this an almost severe palate impression. To say that this Riesling, with its penetrating, almost electrified finish, is youthfully high-spirited would be gross understatement. I tasted it soon after bottling and am confident that it will have harmonized somewhat in the meantime. But I don’t think anything other than time will really rein it in – and then not for many decades. I was unfortunately unable to taste this year’s Trockenbeerenauslese, a deficiency I hope to make up for closer to the time when Muller decides to auction it.

If I could, though, I’d give up the word ‘Kabinett’ instantly.” The finish of this Kabinett has serious mineral weight and richness of peach and purple plum fruit, but a lovely aura of floral essences, and unusually pungent yet refreshing herbal notes suggesting mint and oregano hang over the whole performance.

2098,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A P # 11,"This is the 2005 Scharzhofberger Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese A.P. #11. So ominously smoky, citric, high-toned, yeasty, and spiritous that it flares the nostrils, this amazing wine comes onto the palate thick and creamy, packed with peach jam, dried apricot, white raisins and honey, yet also suffused with invigoratingly fresh citrus. A T.B.A. possessed of a truly remarkable finish, it somehow combines gripping intensity of citrus, pit fruits, and honey with the suggestion of effortless, weightless lift-off. The remaining T.B.A.s – of which there will be two or three depending on whether each of the lots reaches the level of alcohol to legally count as “wine” – will be offered in the manner usual for Muller bottlings of upper-Pradikat, namely at future auctions.

2099,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A P #5,"The 2005 Scharzhofberger Riesling Spatlese A.P. #5, which will be auctioned, exhibits a more rarified and deft construction than its A.P. #4 sibling. White peach, apple blossom, and honeysuckle aromas soar from the glass, and on the palate creaminess of texture is combined with vivacity, cut, and clarity thanks to vivid yet ripe acids and great purity of fruit. Nor does this wine permit the taster to for one instant forget its slatey origins. A scintillating interplay of orchard fruits, flowers, and dramatic wet stone and salty minerality informs a finish of transparency, refinement, and sensational length. Those lucky enough to acquire some of this gem should have no compunction about cellaring it for a quarter century or more.

2100,Egon Muller,Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Long Gold Capsule A P #9,"The 2005 Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese Long Gold Capsule A.P. #9, which will be auctioned, smells of peach and apricot jam laced with fresh lemon and honey, and studded with white raisins. In the mouth – viscously rich, yet turbo-charged with ripe acidity – it offers an incredible concentration of fresh, jammy and distilled pit fruit essences, citrus, honey, and nut oils. As blazingly bright and amazingly dense as this wine is, it won’t be entirely fair to judge it until it settles down. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to taste this year’s Scharzhofberger Beerenauslese (A.P. #10). Muller made early headlines for vinifying an unprecedented number of different Scharzhofberger Trockenbeerenauslesen from 2005, and for subsequently electing to offer one of them for sale directly to the trade in the year following the harvest.

Refined in flavors and satiny in texture, it combines a relative softness of ripe acids with a near weightless impression. After the dramatic minerality, nooks and crannies of flavor, and overall intensity exhibited by this year’s auction Spatlese, one has to recalibrate to appreciate the gentle virtues of this Auslese #6, but the orchard fruit and floral flavors here go on and on, and I would bet on the wine’s taking on further complexity while preserving its distinctive balance over at least a 20-year period.

Almost ominously pungent and smoky in its aromatic expression of botrytis, this Auslese also exhibits a strikingly bright acidity. The botrytis takes an ethereally honeyed tone on the palate, where the wine’s lemony citricity and hints of fruit pit bitterness offer counterpoint to the sweetness, and the finish here is both imposingly rich and refreshingly bright. That said, this overtly concentrated Riesling lacks the rarified elegance, the lift and refinement of Muller’s best wines.

Twice the wine was extremely closed and firm, with an evolved plum/garnet color, high levels of tannin, sweet black currant, prune, and olive-tinged fruit, and astringent tannin in the medium-bodied finish.

It remains a sumptuously rich, intensely flavored wine (from a magnum). Anticipated maturity: Now.   Last tasted, 3/91.",,RP 88
2148,Gaja,Vieux Château Certan,"This wine has gotten mixed reviews in my notes. Several years ago it was big and powerful, but coarse, dumb, and totally lacking in finesse. At a vertical tasting of Vieux-Chateau-Certan, it was still a little rough around the edges, but displayed rich, deep, youthfully scented fruit, full body, plenty of weight and power, and impressive length. The score reflects the better effort. Anticipated maturity: Now.   Last tasted, 5/83.",,RP 88
2149,Gaja,Vieux Château Certan,"The 1994 is performing well, with no harsh tannin or vegetal characteristics. It displays a deep ruby color, and a sweet, jammy, cherry, Asian spice, as well as a smoky-scented nose. Dense, rich, medium-bodied flavors exhibit excellent concentration, and fine purity. The wine possesses low acidity and plenty of flesh, so it should drink well between now and 2010.",,RP 88
2150,Gaja,Vieux Château Certan,"Disappointing following bottling, this green-flavored, herbaceous, medium-bodied wine exhibits spice and red fruit notes, but it tastes underripe and meagerly-endowed. Anticipated maturity: now-2006.",,RP 88

The 1952 Vieux-Chateau-Certan is in extraordinary condition.  The wine, a sleeper, was sweet and cedary, with a huge, almost hickory, roasted, smoky nose that was reminiscent of a top Graves.  Full-bodied, with glorious concentration and richness, this wine still possesses plenty of tannin and youthfulness.  It will easily keep for another 10-20 years.",,RP 88

The 1950 is a remarkably rich, still youthful wine from this fabulous vintage in Pomerol.  The color remains an amazing garnet/purple, and the nose offers sensationally ripe, chocolatey, cassis aromas intertwined with herbs, licorice, Asian spices and coffee.  Extremely full-bodied with port-like viscosity similar to the 1947, this blockbuster wine must be one of the least-known profound wines of the century.",,RP 88

The 1948 Vieux-Chateau-Certan is another profoundly great wine from the forgotten vintage of the forties.  I have tasted this wine four times in the last year and it was exceptional in each tasting.  The opaque dark purple/garnet color is followed by a huge, exotic nose of caramel, sweet cassis, soy sauce, walnuts, and coffee.  Thick, chewy, fabulously concentrated flavors with low acidity and high tannin coat the palate.  There is amazing glycerin and an elevated alcohol level to this super-concentrated wine.  Although fully mature, it exhibits no signs of decline and will easily last for 15-20 more years.  Remarkable!",,RP 88

A dazzling wine, which I have tasted a number of times over the years, the 1947 Vieux-Chateau-Certan is typical of so many 1947 Pomerols.  Its thick, viscous, port-like style and texture are the hallmarks of this vintage.  More advanced than the 1948, it reveals a smoky, meaty, truffle, and blackcurrant-scented nose, as well as massive, chewy flavors loaded with glycerin, extract, and alcohol.  It exhibits more amber at the edge than the 1948, but, wow, what a mouthful of wine!  Like many 1947 Pomerols, its unctuosity and thickness make me wonder if a spoon would stand up in the glass without any support?  Drink it over the next 10-12 years.",,RP 88

Tasted twice and rated highly each time, the 1945 is an exceptional winemaking effort in what can be a frightfully tannic vintage.  It exhibits a dark, murky, plum color with little garnet at the edge.  It also possesses a huge nose of smoked meats, black-raspberries, plums, licorice, and tar.  Dense, chewy, and powerful, with gobs of tannin, and amazing fruit extraction, this full-throttle wine must be at its plateau of maturity, yet I see no reason it cannot last for two more decades.",,RP 88

2158,Gaja,Vieux Château Certan,"I have had this wine several times over the last few years and it can be magnificent, having merited a score in the upper-nineties in the past.  This particular bottle demonstrated the fact that when buying and drinking ancient vintages, one should expect a tremendous amount of variation.  Although the nose offered spicy, earthy, herb-like aromas, and the flavors revealed fine ripeness and firm tannin, the wine lacked the generosity and richness I have experienced in other bottles, and the finish was hollow, astringent, and tannic.",,RP 88
2159,Gaja,Barbaresco,"The Gaja 2013 Barbaresco is a toned and elegant wine with a very impactful and focused bouquet. Dark fruit nuances segue seamlessly to spice, grilled herb, tar, licorice and leather. In keeping with that trademark Gaja touch, those transitions feel polished, long and smooth. The pleasure factor is high on this wine, thanks to the robust concentration it offers and the beautifully velvety nature of its texture. Gaia Gaja tells me that she and her family are especially happy with the quality of tannins achieved in this vintage. They do indeed show a noticeable level of succulence and proverbial crunch.",,RP 93+
2160,Gaja,Langhe Gaia & Rey,"Fresh, compelling and showing impressive definition, the 2013 Langhe Gaia & Rey is a beautiful creation and a wine that occupies a school of its own, especially considering its context that is so focused on great red wine production. There are creeping similarities that are fun to note. Specifically, I am referring to the mouthfeel of this wine that shows sophistication, richness and a creamy texture. It could drink well with structured foods, pork or spicy beef tartare. The bouquet is plentiful and rich with passion fruit, melon, apricot and toasted almond. The wine is exuberant and generous. Given that I tasted a beautifully preserved 1996 vintage of Gaia & Rey at the same time, I feel confident in suggesting a very long drinking window.",,RP 93+
2161,Gaja,Langhe Alteni di Brassica,"The delightful 2013 Langhe Alteni di Brassica (Sauvignon Blanc) shows fullness and ripeness with bright aromas of exotic fruit, white flower, wild sage and crushed white stone. This was a slightly cooler vintage and you get a beautiful sense of varietal pureness, focus and sharpness as a result. Melon and white rose make for a fitting close. The mouthfeel is lean, but not to be underestimated. The wine leaves a long, crisp sensation on the palate.",,RP 93+
2162,Gaja,Langhe Darmagi,"The powerful and impeccable 2012 Langhe Darmagi is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with a tiny drop of Merlot mixed into the blend. The wine is gorgeous and shows extremely well in this warm vintage. It opens to dark penetration and a thickly extracted, but always elegant style. The tannins are very well managed with soft contours and a firm inner crunchiness that adds backbone and determination. Softer layers of cherry and blackberry fuel the long, opulent finish. ",,RP 93+
2163,Gaja,Barbaresco,"The 2012 Barbaresco shows different DNA from its previous incarnations. Angelo Gaja usually blends fruit from 14 vineyard sites to make this wine. Starting with this vintage, he has opted to reduce that number to eight vineyards instead. The change is subtle, but you can taste it. At this young stage in the wine's life I was unsure of the results. This Barbaresco is more austere, thorny and nervous compared to the super supple and rich vintages of the immediate past. The nose shows dark fruit follow by cola, garden herb and white pepper. The mouthfeel is silky and firm and edgy.",,RP 93+
2164,Gaja,Langhe Sperss,"With fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, the 2011 Langhe Sperss is a wine of profound beauty. This is a velvety and caressing expression with dark fruit layers followed by kirsch, cassis, leather, balsam herb and white truffle. The Gaja family decided to move their bottling date forward in order to preserve the integrity and freshness of fruit in this warm vintage. This move has helped to avoid overripe sensations. In fact, Langhe Sperss seems fresh and tonic. This bodes exceptionally well for its aging potential.",,RP 93+
2165,Gaja,Langhe Conteisa,"The 2011 Langhe Nebbiolo Conteisa is an irresistible wine with enormous depth, beauty and penetration. It sweeps over the palate in opulent waves with dark fruit, spice, leather and grilled herbs. It also shows a distinct balsam personality with cola and dried violets that give the wine a beautiful sense of aromatic lift and buoyancy. Langhe Conteisa is made with Nebbiolo (and a tiny part Barbera) from the Cerequio vineyard in La Morra. The 2011 vintage is slightly broader than past vintages, but this wine promises a long drinking evolution regardless.",,RP 93+
2166,Gaja,Langhe Gaia & Rey,"The 1996 Langhe Gaia & Rey is a gorgeous expression of Chardonnay that left me absolutely delighted and surprised. At the end of my tasting of Gaja's reds, Gaia Gaja pulled out this previously opened magnum and offered a taste. The experience was memorable thanks to the gentle aging process that has enhanced and refined this luminous white. Its structure is intact and tight. The wine shows elegant tertiary aromas of crushed mineral dried fruit, apricot and dried sage. It is difficult to assign a drinking window to a wine like this given that it has already beat the odds by showing so well today.",,RP 93+
2167,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The exciting 2011 Sori San Lorenzo is a wine of enormous beauty and grace. Gaia Gaja classifies her three single vineyard Langhe Nebbiolo wines as follows: Costa Russi is “flowers;” Sori Tildin is “fruit;” and San Lorenzo is “plant” (with more structure and a more compact feel). San Lorenzo does indeed boast a strong mineral component of pencil shavings and crushed granite, followed by red cherry and soft spice. The wine’s tannins start off harder than the other wines, but soften with time. Drink: 2018-2040.  

I have some happy news to report from the exciting world of Angelo Gaja. The estate that was notoriously difficult (if not impossible) to visit for those outside the wine trade is now opening its doors to the public. There is a steep entrance fee, but the scheme makes perfect sense in my option. Any wine lover can make an appointment to tour the estate and sample wine for up to 300 euros a person. The money must be paid to charity as none of the proceeds go to Gaja. If you have a favorite non-profit organization, make a donation in that amount. Once you send receipt of payment to Gaja’s tasting room staff, your visit will be granted. It sounds like a fair exchange to me.

2174,Gaja,Costa Russi,"The vineyard designate 1990 Barbaresco Costa Russi offers a fascinating glimpse back in time. Angelo Gaja would famously declassify this wine to Langhe Nebbiolo, starting with the 1996 vintage, and he added a small percentage of Barbera to highlight its overall acidic component. It ages in barrique for one year followed by oak casks for a second year. The 1990 Barbaresco Costa Russi is special, thanks to a high degree of elegance and finesse that is expressed in the wine’s fine tannic structure. Its composition is as soft and caressing as the ancient silk threads that make up precious Chinese textiles. Its appearance is beautifully luminous and profound with brilliant ruby and garnet highlights. Again, there’s a sense of tension and crispness that adds a jolt of vitality to the long finish. This is a true masterpiece, and if you have a bottle, you could double decant as much as 12 to 24 hours prior to drinking it. Drink: 2014-2030. ",,RP 93+
2175,Gaja,Barbaresco,"Gaja’s 1990 Barbaresco shows an unbelievable level of youthfulness that absolutely defies the effects of time. Blackberry, cherry and plum are miraculously intact and immaculately preserved. This Barbaresco offers much more than a solid base of fruit to keep it relevant. The bouquet is beautifully expressive with etched mineral tones of chalk and brimstone as well as elegantly ethereal layers of balsam herb, rosemary, cola and Asian spice. The wine is drinking superbly at the moment and there’s an exciting level of tension and energy that sets it apart from the rest. The 1990 vintage was released as Angelo Gaja was enjoying one of his many career highpoints. In 1988, he purchased vineyards in the Barolo appellation (previously he purchased fruit) and his landmark Barolo Sperss was released in 1992. In the 1990s, he would expand his winemaking reach to Montalcino and Bolgheri (both in Tuscany) with additional acquisitions in those areas. The success of the 1990 vintage was a huge part of this magical moment on the Gaja timeline. With good potential for further aging, this bottle can be opened now or stored in the cellar for another decade or more. Drink: 2014-2028. ",,RP 93+
2176,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"A banner wine for Gaja, the 2010 Sori San Lorenzo brings the infinite and ethereal aromas associated with Nebbiolo into startling focus and clarity. Again, like the Sori Tildin, the structure and tannic firmness of the wine will carry the wine forward over the years and decades ahead. It demands much more time until it fully blossoms. I walked through the San Lorenzo vineyard with Gaia Gaja and she showed me some of their recent activity. Every second row is planted with barley that acts as a natural rototiller given its aggressive root system. Borrowing other “New World” ideas, they’ve started compost piles with Californian red worms and are using (with less success, I’m told) wooden tree boxes to repopulate the birds. All of this must seem very odd to the neighbors. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2040.  

Just a short while ago, in the midst of one of Italy’s darkest political hours when forming a functioning government seemed like an exercise in futility, someone sent me a Facebook petition proposing Angelo Gaja as a candidate for President of the Republic of Italy.

2177,Gaja,Sori Tildin,"Gaia Gaja uses the word “salty” to describe this next wine, and I see her point. The 2010 Sori Tildin shows a dry, firmly structured quality that enhances those extraordinary, breezy overtones of lead pencil and brimstone that so fittingly frame the Nebbiolo grape. The lingering end-notes of rose petal, ginger and cedar are striking. You immediately feel the tannic structure and power of the wine. The jump is very sharp next to the Costa Russi, and that’s why this is one of Gaja’s best cellar-agers. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2040.

This is an especially imposing vintage for Sori Tildin. Over time, the wine’s signature nuances and details begin to emerge. A radiant, sensual personality rounds things out nicely. This is a great showing from Gaja. The 2009 shuts down quickly in the glass, and is likely to demand a measure of patience from readers. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.  

Angelo Gaja doesn’t say too much about his wines these days. He doesn’t need to. The wines more than speak for themselves. What impresses me most about the 2009s is the elegance of their tannin. This is a vintage where managing the crop load was critical in achieving balance. Gaja is one of the very few growers who got it right. His wines stand out for their textural finesse and sense of harmony. Although Gaja is easily the most glamorous winery in Piedmont, it remains a family affair, with Angelo Gaja’s wife Lucia, and their daughters Gaia and Rossana increasingly involved, and their younger brother Giovanni set to follow in their footsteps. Long-time winemaker Guido Rivella keeps a much lower profile, but he is the man who has produced all of Gaja’s most legendary wines going back to 1970. Angelo Gaja describes 2009 as a year with a lot of rain until June. The bunches on average were loose and the berries small, which resulted in high skin-to-juice ratios, which is quite favorable for ageworthy wines.

2184,Gaja,Costa Russi,"The overt fruit and depth typical of Costa Russi comes through in spades in the 2009. Plums, black cherries, chocolate and new leather form the core of this round, expressive Costa Russi. As beautiful as this is, the 2009 remains deeply marked by the vintage. There is plenty of beauty and richness in the glass, but not quite the sheer visceral thrill of the very best Costa Russis. Although I wouldn’t open any of the 2009 single-vineyard wines in the near-term, the Costa Russi is the most expressive of the three. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029.  

Angelo Gaja doesn’t say too much about his wines these days. He doesn’t need to. The wines more than speak for themselves. What impresses me most about the 2009s is the elegance of their tannin. This is a vintage where managing the crop load was critical in achieving balance. Gaja is one of the very few growers who got it right. His wines stand out for their textural finesse and sense of harmony. Although Gaja is easily the most glamorous winery in Piedmont, it remains a family affair, with Angelo Gaja’s wife Lucia, and their daughters Gaia and Rossana increasingly involved, and their younger brother Giovanni set to follow in their footsteps. Long-time winemaker Guido Rivella keeps a much lower profile, but he is the man who has produced all of Gaja’s most legendary wines going back to 1970.

2185,Gaja,Barbaresco,"The 2009 Barbaresco is absolutely remarkable for the way it carersses the palate with endless layers of sweet red fruit. Will the 2009 shut down in bottle? Truth is, I don’t know, but the wine is exceptionally beautiful and polished from the very first taste. Ripe, red berries, crushed flowers and deeply spiced notes are woven into an intricate fabric of indescribable class. I am not sure how Angelo Gaja and his team do it, but this is a super-impressive wine in every way. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029.

Getting to the top in any field is hard. Staying at the top is even harder. For all of the praise Angelo Gaja and his family have received over the years, they have earned and deserve every bit of it. These new releases, the 2008 reds from Barolo in particular, are insanely beautiful.

White peaches, melon, flowers and sage are some of the aromas and flavors that emerge in the glass, while typical varietal Sauvignon notes are more in the background. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2017.

2188,Gaja,Conteisa,"The 2008 Conteisa is a knock-out. It boasts the most striking inner sweetness and perfume imaginable, a quality shared by a handful of legendary Piemonte wines. Juicy red cherries, spices, hard candy and mint caress the palate in this extraordinary, breathtaking wine. The balance of aromatics, fruit, acidity and structure are simply captivating. The 2008 is of course far too young to deliver maximum pleasure, but it is impossible to miss its pedigree. This is a fabulous showing from Gaja. Conteisa is often outstanding, but the 2008 will go down as one of the great all-time vintages for this wine. Conteisa is made from Gaja's plots in the Cerequio vineyard of La Morra. Anticipated maturity: 2023-2043.

2189,Gaja,Sperss,"The 2008 Sperss is exotic, dark and totally seductive. Black cherries, mint, licorice, flowers, spices and juniper berries meld together in the glass, all supported by firm, insistent tannins. Today the Sperss has begun to shut down in bottle. It isn't anywhere near as expressive as the Conteisa, but that will come in time. There is so much to look forward to, but readers will have to be patient. In time, the 2008 Sperss will be yet another viscerally thrilling wine. Sperss is made from the Marenca and Rivette vineyards in Serralunga. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2048.

2190,Gaja,Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2008 Darmagi (Cabernet Sauvignon) is gorgeous. It shows terrific richness and density with plenty of varietal character and personality, all in a highly attractive, medium-bodied style. Plums, black cherries, cassis and sweet herbs flow gracefully as the wine shows off its irresistible personality. Darmagi is tricky because it is more sensitive to vintage than most of Gaja's other wines. The 2008, though, is striking. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2026.

All of the elements are beautifully balanced in this soft, articulate Gaia e Rey. The 2008 is a gorgeous yet understated vintage for this wine. The 2008 was fermented in stainless steel, and was then moved into French oak barrels for the malolactic fermentation and aging. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.

2192,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The 2001 Sori San Lorenzo is the richest and deepest of these 2001s. It remains cool, inward and totally implosive. Dark fruit, leather, goudron and licorice are some of the notes that begin to emerge over time. The 2001 is dazzling, but it is also very much on the muscular side and needs time to soften. I imagine it will drink beautifully for another 20 years, and that is likely to be conservative in light of the glacial pace with which the San Lorenzo ages. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2034.  

Angelo Gaja isn’t the talkative type too often these days. Most of the time I am greeted, left alone in a room to taste, and then greeted again before I leave. On this day, though, Gaja started talking about vintages, and in particular the misconception that wines from hot years don’t age. Gaja cited 1961, a warm year in Piedmont, and one of the most legendary at the time. The wines aged just fine, added Gaja. What struck me most, though, was how clear Gaja’s recollection was of events that transpired fifty years ago. I know only one other person in Piedmont who has a similarly sharp memory that goes that far back. What does that have to do with these 2001s? Not much, except that it seemed like an interesting anecdote to share.

The fruit remains fabulously rich and vibrant from start to finish. This is a very refined showing from Angelo Gaja. The 2001 is still quite young and appears to have a bright future.

2194,Gaja,Sperss,"The 2001 Sperss is the alter ego to the Conteisa. It is a decidedly powerful, virile wine with plenty of Serralunga muscle in its powerful, brooding personality. Tobacco, mint, crushed flowers, licorice and leather are some of the notes that add complexity and depth to the dark fruit. Layers of flavor build to the explosive finish. Readers will have to be patient with the Sperss. All it needs is time. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2031.

The tannins could use more bottle age to soften further, but the Costa Russi is hugely attractive even today. Sweet tobacco, spices and crushed flowers linger in the empty glass.

Dark cherries, plums, bell peppers, sweet herbs and licorice are nicely layered in this vibrant, powerful Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2001 Darmagi brings together the characteristics of cool-climate Cabernet and an extroverted personality that are very nicely balanced. The 2001 is still very much on the young side, although it can be enjoyed today. I am amazed at how well the 2001 has developed over the years. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2021.

Hints of early maturity appear in the aromatics, but the wine has more than enough fruit to support at least another decade of fine drinking. Tobacco, sweet herbs and licorice add the final notes of complexity. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2021.

2199,Gaja,Sori Tildin,"The 2008 Sori Tildin is impressive. I confess I wasn’t quite prepared for the assault of fruit and tannins here. Sori Tildin is so often a graceful, elegant wine, but that is not the case in 2008. That’s not to say elegance is missing, but this is a big, big wine with tons of intensity and richness, all woven together beautifully. It’s tough to find a comparison with a previous vintage, as this is a singular Tildin. The flavors are familiar if a touch on the dark side, but the structure is closer than that of Sori San Lorenzo. Flowers, tar, leather and licorice wrap around the palate. This is a fabulous showing and a great wine in the making. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2033.  

This is a stunning set of wines from Angelo Gaja and his team in Barbaresco. Those who think 2008 is a truly great year for Nebbiolo must have tasted these wines. In a vintage that is inconsistent across the villages of Barbaresco, Gaja has produced not one but four stellar wines. As fabulous as these wines are, they aren’t especially true to type, as I explain in these notes. The 2008s I tasted in the US showed far better than the bottles I tasted in Barbaresco during the summer. Perhaps the onset of the cool fall weather gave these wines a little more spine than they had during the sweltering heat of August. Readers who want to learn more about the 2011 harvest at Gaja may want to take a look at my video interview with Gaia Gaja and vineyard manager Giorgio Culasso.

2200,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"Gaja’s 2008 Sori San Lorenzo is impeccable from start to finish. The 2008 is a round, seamless San Lorenzo with seemingly no hard edges and terrific overall balance. The signature aromas and flavors are there, as is the wine’s typical gravitas, yet the 2008 has an extra level of sweetness, its size notwithstanding. The wine possesses striking inner perfume and fabulous overall balance. The sheer excitement of the very finest years isn’t quite there, but this is a fine bottle just the same. An explosive, juicy finish rounds things out in style. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2033.

The 2008 is a firm Costa Russi, with less of the seductiveness of most years, but equally fine balance. Ideally it needs a few more years in bottle, but it is striking. The finish shows terrific intensity. The typical juiciness of the site is framed by the firm tannins of the year. Everything that makes Costa Russi such an engaging wine is here, but in a slightly smaller-scaled package than in the very finest years. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2028.

The 2008 isn’t a blockbuster, but it should drink well with minimum cellaring. This is a classic, linear Barbaresco endowed with terrific energy and focus. Right now the 2008 seems to be holding its cards close to the vest. I would not be surprised to see it show even better in a few years’ time. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2028.

Despite its sheer power, the 2000 isn’t as explosive as it can be. Still, there is little doubt the 2000 Sori San Lorenzo has the stuffing to age well for many years to come.

Angelo Gaja’s 2000s are a bit of a mystery. The wines were absolutely beautiful upon release and equally impressive when I tasted them a few years later for the 7th edition of Parker’s Wine Buyers Guide. The 2000s were far less convincing when I tasted them in November 2010. All of the wines were initially very reticent and closed. After an hour or two in the glass they opened for about 30 minutes before closing back down again. Gaja thinks the wines are passing through a stage of inaccessibility. If anyone deserves the benefit of the doubt it is Gaja. I can’t remember the last older wine from this cellar that was a disappointment or that hadn’t aged well, and I have been privileged to taste the vast majority of wines that have been made here under Angelo Gaja’s tenure. Time will ultimately tell where these wines are headed, but this was not an especially flattering showing for Gaja’s 2000s. That said, most producers would be thrilled to have wines like these in their cellars. In some ways, Gaja is a victim of his own success.

That said, most producers would be thrilled to have wines like these in their cellars. In some ways, Gaja is a victim of his own success. He sets such a high bar with his finest vintages; it is only natural to expect greatness all the time. The 2000s fall a bit short of that mark but are quite strong in the context of the year.",,RP 93+
2207,Gaja,Costa Russi,"The 2000 Costa Russi comes across as rich, dense and powerful, with impressive depth in its dark fruit. As always, Costa Russi is the most forward of Gaja’s single-vineyard wines from Barbaresco. The intensity of the fruit carries through nicely to the finish. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2020.  

Angelo Gaja’s 2000s are a bit of a mystery. The wines were absolutely beautiful upon release and equally impressive when I tasted them a few years later for the 7th edition of Parker’s Wine Buyers Guide. The 2000s were far less convincing when I tasted them in November 2010. All of the wines were initially very reticent and closed. After an hour or two in the glass they opened for about 30 minutes before closing back down again. Gaja thinks the wines are passing through a stage of inaccessibility. If anyone deserves the benefit of the doubt it is Gaja.

2208,Gaja,Barbaresco,"The 2000 Barbaresco is beginning to show early tertiary qualities. Smoke, tobacco, cedar and dried cherries are some of the notes that emerge from the glass. Over time the Barbaresco gains a measure of freshness, with pretty floral aromas that weave into the finish. The tannins remain quite firm, and are likely to outlast the fruit.

2209,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The 2007 Langhe Sori San Lorenzo is perhaps the most massive, virile wine in this lineup, and accordingly it will require the most time. Tannic and austere at the outset, the wine gradually opens to reveal staggering richness and depth in its dark fruit. The wine turns more elegant in the glass, revealing a myriad of black fruit, tar, licorice, spices and scorched earth in a dazzling display of class and elegance. This is one for the ages. Anticipated maturity: 2027-2047.  

My most recent visit to Gaja was quite an experience, as I tasted all of the estate’s 1989s, 1990s and 2007s. The 1989s and 1990s are reviewed in this issue’s What About Now feature. Angelo Gaja, always loquacious on a wide range of subjects, says virtually nothing about his wines, an approach I have increasingly come to appreciate in an era where so many producers are constantly in pitch mode. Then again, Gaja doesn’t really need to say anything, the wines speak for themselves. I tasted the 2007s at the winery in November 2009 and then again in New York in January 2010. Both times they were spectacular. Stylistically the 2007s remind me of the 1997s in terms of their opulence. Gaja’s wines are often immensely appealing when young – which is certainly the case with the 2007s – but then close down in bottle for a number of years, sometimes many years. My impression is that the Costa Russi and Conteisa are the most likely of these 2007s to offer the widest drinking windows throughout their lives with a minimum of cellaring. Fermentation and malolactic fermentation take place in steel. The wines then spend approximately one year in French oak and a second year in cask prior to being bottled. As has been the case for a number of years now, Gaja’s Langhe wines incorporate a small percentage of Barbera. On a final note, it’s great to see Gaja’s daughters Gaia and Rossana increasingly involved in the winery. They, and their younger brother Giovanni, have big shoes to fill, but couldn’t have asked for better teachers than Angelo and Lucia Gaja.

This insanely beautiful wine boasts a breathtaking bouquet, explosive, generous fruit and an absolutely eternal finish. Layers of dark red fruit, minerals, flowers and spices saturate every corner of the palate as this mind-blowing Costa Russi struts its stuff. This is a towering effort from Angelo Gaja.

2211,Gaja,Sperss,"The 2007 Langhe Sperss is beyond impeccable in the way it combines a powerful expression of Serralunga fruit in a round, enveloping style. Make no mistake about it, there is plenty of intensity and muscle here, but in 2007 Sperss is exceptionally harmonious from the start. The fruit is decidedly darker than the red-toned Conteisa, while an array of licorice, smoke and iron – all typical of Serralunga – add further gravitas. Even as the tannins build on the close, here, too, the finish is utterly sublime. The 2007 Sperss will test readers’ patience but it is simply magnificent even today. Readers who can wait will be rewarded with a breathtaking bottle of wine. Anticipated maturity: 2022-2047.

A remarkably vivid wine, the sensual Sori Tildin caresses the palate with silky, textured fruit, showing incredible power, length and class. There is a transparency to the wine that is beguiling. Once again, the finish is eternal. Sori Tildin is one of Gaja’s more nuanced wines, and in 2007 it is breathtakingly beautiful. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2037.

This is another soft, seamless wine from Gaja, with gorgeous purity in the fruit that carries through all the way to the deeply satisfying, creamy finish. The tannins remain impeccably refined and beautifully balanced with the fruit. The wine is likely to firm up a touch in bottle, but it should be one of the most accessible of Gaja’s 2007s.

Soft and seamless on the palate, the Barbaresco shows wonderful integrity in its fruit in an opulent, yet mid-weight style. Fragrant, perfumed aromatics are woven throughout, while an attractive spiciness develops in the glass. There is incredible depth to the fruit and simply phenomenal overall balance. Readers will not want to miss this Barbaresco; arguably Gaja’s finest since 1997. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.

2215,Gaja,Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon,"Admittedly, the 2007 Langhe Darmagi (Cabernet Sauvignon) is a wine I don’t get. Gaja has nothing left to prove to anyone, so why he continues to squander this top-flight vineyard in Barbaresco on Cabernet Sauvignon is frankly beyond me. Sure, the 2007 Darmagi impresses for its sheer concentration and balance, but at the end of the day, there is little varietal character or personality here. There is now enough evidence to conclude that this vineyard is capable of occasionally producing a distinctive Cabernet Sauvignon but without much consistency from year to year.

It, too, is more overtly structured, powerful and less fruit-forward than the 2007, but its focus and drive are commendable. The wine seems to hover on the palate with an ethereal expression of dark fruit, smoke, licorice, tar and menthol, all of which are backed up with substantial heft and sheer muscle. This is a marvelous effort from Gaja and will appeal most to readers with a preference for sturdy, age-worthy wines. Anticipated maturity: 2021-2041.

Angelo Gaja’s 1989s and 1990s are simply glorious. Gaja is frequently criticized, especially in Italy, a country that has an uneasy relationship with success of any kind. To be sure, Gaja likes to mix things up with views that are at times perhaps unnecessarily provocative. Prices have always been a point of contention among the estate’s detractors, as even Gaja’s father Giovanni sold his own wines at prices considered to be astronomical more than 50 years ago. At the end of the day, though, the only thing that counts is what is in the glass, and the simple truth is that these wines are utterly mind-blowing. Angelo Gaja had at least one big advantage vis-a-vis his neighbors. Gaja began working full-time at his family’s winery in 1969, and was followed a year later in 1970 by oenologist Guido Rivella. By the time 1989 came around Gaja and Rivella had been working together for nearly 20 years, and were perfectly positioned to make the most of these two historic harvests, which they certainly did. Gaja was so far ahead of his time that there are plenty of producers in Piedmont (and Italy) that still haven’t caught up to the groundbreaking wines he made 20 years ago. I have had many of Gaja’s 1989s and 1990s recently in less formal settings and have never been anything less than deeply impressed. Readers fortunate to own these bottles should be thrilled. For his 1989s and 1990s, Gaja carried out the malolactic fermentations in stainless steel and aged the wines for a year in French oak followed by a year in cask, an approach he employs today. Although Gaja’s wines are often flashy upon release, these bottles attest rather eloquently to the glacial aging that is the hallmark of the house style. One of the very few critiques I can make is that Sori San Lorenzo and Sperss were far less consistently profound twenty years ago than they are today. If there is one truism with Gaja, it is that one only needs to taste the Barbaresco to understand the quality of the vintage. When the Barbaresco is truly great (as it is in 1997, 2001, 2004 and 2007) all of the other wines will almost certainly be profound.",,RP 98

For his 1989s and 1990s, Gaja carried out the malolactic fermentations in stainless steel and aged the wines for a year in French oak followed by a year in cask, an approach he employs today. Although Gaja’s wines are often flashy upon release, these bottles attest rather eloquently to the glacial aging that is the hallmark of the house style. One of the very few critiques I can make is that Sori San Lorenzo and Sperss were far less consistently profound twenty years ago than they are today. If there is one truism with Gaja, it is that one only needs to taste the Barbaresco to understand the quality of the vintage.

2221,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The 1990 Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo is a dark, hulking wine boasting masses of dark fruit, scorched earth and herbs. Initially somewhat rustic, the wine becomes rounder and more generous with time in the glass. Still, this remains a bit of a wild, unrestrained wine from Gaja that lacks the elegance that informs the very finest Sori San Lorenzos. Anticipated maturity: 2010- 2030.  

Angelo Gaja’s 1989s and 1990s are simply glorious. Gaja is frequently criticized, especially in Italy, a country that has an uneasy relationship with success of any kind. To be sure, Gaja likes to mix things up with views that are at times perhaps unnecessarily provocative. Prices have always been a point of contention among the estate’s detractors, as even Gaja’s father Giovanni sold his own wines at prices considered to be astronomical more than 50 years ago. At the end of the day, though, the only thing that counts is what is in the glass, and the simple truth is that these wines are utterly mind-blowing. Angelo Gaja had at least one big advantage vis-a-vis his neighbors. Gaja began working full-time at his family’s winery in 1969, and was followed a year later in 1970 by oenologist Guido Rivella.

Fruit, acidity and structure; it’s all there in the magical 1989 Sori Tildin. This is another immortal, totally seductive wine from Gaja. As always, the Sori Tildin is the most sculpted and nuanced of Gaja’s single-vineyard wines. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.

In 1989 the Costa Russi offers a touch more roundness and spiciness than the Barbaresco. The fruit here is super-luxurious and silky, while the tannins possess remarkable polish. The finish remains firm and full of life. Even 20 years ago Angelo Gaja and Guido Rivella were making wines most producers would kill for today.

The wine reveals stunning elegance and purity wrapped around a powerful core of Serralunga fruit that speaks volumes of the greatness of this terroir. The 1989 Sperss can be enjoyed today as the tannins are incredibly finessed, but it also looks to have many years of profound drinking ahead of it. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

This masculine offering lacks some of the nuance of the best of these 1989s, but it is terrific nonetheless. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2035.

This medium-bodied Sori Tildin is the most focussed and energetic of these wines. It offers exceptional length and a refined, polished close. As is often the case, the Sori Tildin is also the most delicate and feminine of the single-vineyard wines. This is a very strong effort even if the explosiveness of the finest vintages is missing. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2031.  

Angelo Gaja's 2006s from Barbaresco are lovely, although they require a bit of aeration to find their focus. Tthe 2006 Barbaresco in particular is quite an achievement in this challenging vintage. As always Gaja blends in a small percentage of Barbera for his single-vineyard Langhe wines.

The authoritative Sori San Lorenzo offers plenty of excitement and sheer pleasure in an extroverted style. The elegant finish is at once powerful and sublime.

As is the case with most wines in this vintage, the 2005 Sperss is relatively compact and two-dimensional yet it offers outstanding balance in an easygoing style for this wine. Gaja’s vineyards in Serralunga are some of the best-exposed plots in the zone, and that clearly was a help here. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022. 

Angelo Gaja’s 2005s from the Barolo zone don’t match the level of his wines from Barbaresco, which are far more harmonious and complete in this vintage.

Although the 2005 doesn’t have the complexity or structure of the finest vintages, it compensates for that with lovely balance and a long, polished finish. Conteisa is made from vines in the Cerequio vineyard in La Morra. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2020.

I was blown away by Angelo Gaja’s 2005 wines from Barbaresco. When all is said and done, Gaja may have well produced not the wine, but rather the wines of the vintage in a year that was excellent but not profound. While Gaja’s 2005 don’t have the explosive, multi-dimensional personalities of his 2004s, they are vibrant offerings that will thrill readers who love Piedmont wines. As always, Gaja blends in a small percentage of Barbera in his single-vineyard wines, but that is hardly noticeable in this vintage. I also noted less new oak than has generally been the case in the recent past. The wines showcase very pure expressions of Nebbiolo and are made in a style that appears to make fewer concessions to the decidedly international approach of previous vintages. In short, these are the most Piedmontese wines I have tasted from Angelo Gaja in a long time. Could it be that the greatest innovator in Piedmont over the last thirty five-plus years has taken a small step towards a more classic style?

Notes of tar, smoke and licorice develop in the glass, adding a touch of complexity and nuance that is sometimes missing in this bottling. The French oak is present, but deftly balanced with the wine’s other components. As always, Costa Russi comes across as relatively accessible when young, but it is sure to only improve with age. Recent bottles of the 1985 have been nothing short of glorious. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2030.

The use of oak is simply masterful here and the wine boasts extraordinary balance. I am not sure how he does it, but Angelo Gaja is easily Italy’s most consistently brilliant producer. For those who can afford it, this is another gem from Gaja. Readers should interpret my drinking windows with a large grain of salt. The 1990 Sor? San Lorenzo is still young, and the 1978 is amazingly fresh, so it is anyone’s guess as to when this wine might be actually “ready.” In the meantime, this wine is sure to provide enormous pleasure to those lucky enough to own it.

This graceful, feminine wine reveals tons of elegance and finesse in an understated style. Today the Sori Tildin shows a touch more oak than the other single-vineyard wines, which suggests it may not quite have the stuffing of the very finest vintages. Still, this remains a vibrant and very Piedmontese wine in need of only one thing, and that is a long slumber in the cellar. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2035.

2239,Gaja,Sperss,"Gaja’s 2004 Langhe Sperss is an infant. Still incredibly primary, it exudes the essence of Serralunga black fruits, smoke and tar. The new oak is still very evident here and the wine seems to be at an awkward phase of its development. Still, it offers stunning concentration as well as length, with soft, caressing tannins that frame the fruit all the way to the long finish. This wine is in need of serious bottle age and may very well merit a higher score once it emerges from its temporary period of dormancy. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.

2240,Gaja,Conteisa,"The 2004 Langhe Conteisa, from vineyards in La Morra, is especially dark-toned and rich in this vintage. Made in an uncharacteristically weighty, opulent style for this wine, it reveals plenty of ripe dark fruit, spices, new leather, licorice and tar. With air it gradually turns more feminine and delicate, yet it remains a gorgeous, sumptuous wine of outstanding pedigree. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2022.

2241,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The 2004 Sori San Lorenzo is a drop-dead gorgeous wine. It presents awesome balance, especially in the way it marries power with elegance. This is a remarkably refined and understated Sori San Lorenzo, with never-ending layers of dark raspberries, licorice, grilled herbs and tar that flow from its sumptuous frame. A dark, brooding beauty, it will require several additional years of bottle at a minimum, but those with the patience to wait will be amply rewarded. In most vintages I prefer the Sori Tildin, but in 2004 Sori San Lorenzo has a very slight edge over its sibling. It may very well be the finest Sori  San Lorenzo since the legendary 1971. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029. 

Angelo Gaja and long-time oenologist Guido Rivella produced some of the most monumental wines of their long, storied partnership in 2004. Although I admire Gaja’s wines, especially for their consistency, I rarely find them this emotionally moving and utterly profound. The stable weather and cool, tempering evenings towards the end of the growing season allowed Gaja and Rivella to harvest fairly late in 2004.  I remember passing by Gaja’s Barbaresco vineyards in October of that year and seeing fruit still waiting to be picked long after most producers had already brought the fruit in. Gaja’s 2004s from Barbaresco are especially breathtaking for their clarity and precision. The wines also seem less internationally-styled than in the past. Readers fortunate enough to possess the means to acquire these wines won’t want to miss them! The 2003s from the Barolo zones of La Morra and Serralunga are also strong efforts considering the vintage. “Historically in Piedmont there has been an inverse relationship between quality and quantity. Great vintages like 1961 and 1989 were characterized by low yields,” says Gaja. “2004 is one of those rare vintages like 1964 and 1990 where quality is high even though yields were generous as well. I think 2004 is a very elegant vintage. It is much easier to achieve opulence in the wines, but finesse is always much more elusive.”

2242,Gaja,Sori Tildin,"Gaja’s 2004 Sori Tildin floats on the palate. It is the most nuanced of these single-vineyard offerings, with gorgeous notes of tar, smoke, roses, violets, sweet toasted oak and earthiness that emerge from the glass in a counterpoint of sublime elegance and stunning purity. It possesses superb length and elegant, silky tannins to round out the finish. This extraordinary Sori Tildin  will require at least a few years of bottle age, but it is destined to be one of the vintage’s legendary wines. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

2243,Gaja,Costa Russi,"The 2004 Costa Russi is irresistibly sexy and opulent. As is typically the case, the wine is more overtly fruit-driven, with a round, supple personality. Sweet, long and richly-textured, it is just plain awesome in its display of generous, vibrant fruit, tar, smoke, minerals and herbs. It is the finest Costa Russi yet.

2245,Gaja,Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon,"Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon aromas and flavors take a back seat to a plump, jammy expression of fruit in the 2004 Darmagi. Made in a very Piedmontese style, it seems to have more in common with Barbera than Cabernet, an impression which is reinforced the more it sits in the glass. This perfumed wine is bursting with pure, clean, well-delineated fruit. It is a lovely effort, yet readers expecting a more representative example of Cabernet Sauvignon will probably be happier looking elsewhere, as this is a very unusual Darmagi. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2024.

2246,Gaja,Sperss,"Gaja’s 2003 Sperss is made from vineyards in Serralunga and offers better balance than the Conteisa. It is plump and juicy, with a generous core of dark fruit, tar and menthol supported by a massive, imposing structure. The wine offers notable length although there is a suggestion of heat on the finish. This powerful, brooding Sperss will require patience, even if today it gives the illusion of being a relatively accessible vintage for this wine. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2023.

2247,Gaja,Conteisa,"The 2003 Conteisa, from the Cerequio vineyard in La Morra, is especially intense in this vintage. It is a rich, full-bodied Conteisa made in a sweet, super-ripe style, with outstanding palate presence and well-integrated tannins. In 2003 the floral, spices notes that are the hallmark of this vineyard are somewhat attenuated. Still, all things considered, this is a lovely effort. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2019.

2248,Gaja,Sori Tildin,"Even in the super-hot 2003 vintage, Gaja’s Sori Tildin displays its pedigree, with its dark ruby color, finely nuanced, detailed aromatics and layers of ripe red fruit that gradually reveal themselves as this exquisite wine sits in the glass. Offering extraordinary depth of expression as well length on the palate along with great overall balance, it is another remarkable wine from Angelo Gaja. As is usually the case, I also find it to be the most classic of the single-vineyard wines. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2025.

2249,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The 2003 Sori San Lorenzo is simply awesome. Boasting the darkest color of these wines as well as captivating aromatics, it is a brooding effort packed with notes of earthiness, tar, smoke, grilled herbs, cassis, licorice and super-ripe plummy fruit. It shows the qualities of 2003 in its full-throttle, expansive style yet it also possesses remarkable balance as well as fine tannins for the vintage. Although there is a little heat on the finish, I found this an utterly compelling wine. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2020.

2250,Gaja,Barbaresco,"Gaja’s 2003 Barbaresco may well challenge its bigger siblings as the most successful of these new releases. Made in a style that combines expressive aromatics, the ripeness of the vintage and classic structure, it is an awesome effort. Though it offers plenty of super-ripe fruit and notable concentration, it never comes across as being heavy and displays exceptional overall balance. Gaja’s Barbaresco rarely shows this well so early in the game and my guess is that my score may end up being conservative. “Oddly enough it was our worst-exposed parcels that performed best in 2003, although I suppose that makes sense given that these plots were more protected from the sun. We did a very severe selection in the cellar and in 2003 we bottled a small amount of Barbaresco, roughly 30,000 bottles as compared to our normal amount of 70,000 bottles. We did a similarly stringent selection with our single-vineyard wines,” adds Gaja. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2021.

2251,Gaja,Costa Russi,"The 2003 Costa Russi is a noticeably bigger and more powerful wine than the Barbaresco. Although it is less expressive in its aromatics, it shows greater palate presence, with suggestions of super-ripe black cherries, tobacco and earthiness on a full-bodied frame with notable depth and a concentrated yet open-knit personality. It offers excellent balance, yet the hard tannins of the vintage are most penalizing in the Costa Russi and this wine comes across as somewhat heavy and ponderous in style, lacking the characteristic elegance of Gaja’s best wines.

Wines like this, made by Piedmont’s most famous producer, can only arouse some serious doubts about the future of Cabernet in the region.

Light gold in tonality, its Meursault-like nose of white peaches, bergamot, tropical fruit and light oak are matched by rich and viscous flavors, tropical, mineral, higher in alcohol than a Burgundy and balanced oak.

Very ample in aroma, with abundant anisette, asphalt, and mocha, it is solid, deep, concentrated but very round, superior in length and continuity, and with all the famed polish of its cru.

It has sizeable structure and important intensity, the richness and depth of extract and the balance of power and finesse are those of outstanding grapes and winemaking.

Deep, rich, and full-bodied, with moderate tannin and power, this impressive offering requires 2-3 years of cellaring, and should age well for two decades.

2268,Gaja,Sperss,"A virtually perfect effort is the 1997 Sperss (30,000 bottles), which represents the essence of truffles, earth, and black cherries in its striking aromatics and multidimensional, opulent, full-bodied palate. The acidity seems low because of the huge glycerin levels and prodigious concentration of fruit, but I suspect it is normal in the scheme of oenological measurement. This profound wine requires 3-4 years of cellaring, and should age well for 30-35 years.

The saturated purple color is followed by a dense, full-bodied wine possessing extraordinary vibrancy for such a heavyweight, muscular Nebbiolo. It offers a super-sweet entry, a boatload of glycerin, and notes of earth, licorice, cedar, blackberry and cherry liqueur, and a touch of blueberries. Extremely full, gorgeously pure, with a seamless texture, this spectacular 1997 will enjoy three decades of cellaring.

It exhibits a striking perfume of lead pencil, roasted nuts, black fruits, spice box, leather, cedar, and Chinese black tea. Forward yet enormously constituted and rich, with an ethereal elegance underpinning its personality, the Sori Lorenzo displays a classic combination of power and finesse. Sadly, there are only 10,000 bottles. As this wine sat in the glass, notes of Japanese soy sauce made an appearance. Anticipated maturity: 2002-2030.

2273,Gaja,Barbaresco,"Gaja's 1997 Barbaresco is undoubtedly the finest he has yet made. An exquisite effort, it boasts a dense ruby/purple color in addition to an extraordinary nose of black cherry liqueur, smoke, licorice, mineral, and floral aromas. The wine is full-bodied, opulent, and loaded with fruit. Despite its precocious nature, there is abundant tannin, and thus 3-4 years of cellaring is required. It should age effortlessly for 25 years.

2275,Gaja,Sori San Lorenzo,"The dense opaque purple-colored 1996 Sori San Lorenzo possesses complex aromatics, consisting of classic Nebbiolo scents of rose petals, dried herbs, spice box, cedar, and abundant jammy black cherry and berry fruit. It is impressively powerful and muscular, with moderate tannin, a sweet, unctuous texture, and a 40+ second finish. Although the aromatics are stunning, this 1996 remains youthful and backward.

As I reported in issue #124 (8-27-99), 1996 is a spectacular vintage for Angelo Gaja. There is a lot of speculation as to why he has dropped the name Barbaresco from the labels of his single-vineyard wines, but given his personality and overall commitment to quality, it can only be to improve the quality and give him some flexibility in difficult vintages to produce a wine that may or may not be 100% Nebbiolo.

The wines are more compact and downsized compared to the three aforementioned vintages. The most interesting is the medium ruby-colored 1993 Barbaresco Sori Tilden. It offers up a Burgundian-like, sweet cherry, earthy, smoky tobacco character. In the mouth, the wine reveals the most intensity, sweetest fruit, and greatest length of this quartet. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and spicy, with some of the vintage's tell-tale dry tannin, the wine has plenty of fruit for balance. This is an excellent example of Sori Tilden that should drink well for 10-15 years, but it is not comparable to the 1988, 1989, or 1990.

Three wines I tasted from Gaja that did not make the recommended list include the vegetal, woody, tannic 1991 Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon ($90), the richer, riper, but still too oaky and tannic 1993 Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon ($90), and the good but uninspiring 1994 Barbera Sito Rey ($42).

The wines are more compact and downsized compared to the three aforementioned vintages. The 1993 Barbaresco Costa Russi is perplexing and difficult to evaluate. The wine possesses a nice inner-core of sweet cherry fruit, but its tannin is so high that it finishes with mouthsearing astringency as well as some bitterness. There is good purity of fruit and medium body, but the wine is tightly knit and may need more time in the bottle. It is a gamble as to whether the fruit will dry out before the tannin subsides.

Although large-sized, it has good finesse as well as beautifully pure fruit. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2020.

2315,Domaine Paul Pillot,Conteisa,"From the Barolo appellation, the 1998 Conteisa displays a distinctive bouquet of black cherry jam mixed with vitamins, smoke, iron, minerals, and spicy oak. In the mouth, earth, truffle, lead pencil, and espresso-infused cherry flavors make an appearance. Deep, rich, and full-bodied, with moderate tannin and power, this impressive offering requires 2-3 years of cellaring, and should age well for two decades.

2316,Domaine Paul Pillot,Barbaresco,"The 1998 Barbaresco is a beautiful effort displaying fleshy, oaky, deep black cherry, raspberry, tar, and truffle scents with subtle new oak in the background. Dense, voluptuously-textured, and full-bodied, with gorgeous overall symmetry, and beautifully integrated tannin, acidity, alcohol, and wood, it will drink well for 15 or more years.

2317,Domaine Paul Pillot,Sperss,"A virtually perfect effort is the 1997 Sperss (30,000 bottles), which represents the essence of truffles, earth, and black cherries in its striking aromatics and multidimensional, opulent, full-bodied palate. The acidity seems low because of the huge glycerin levels and prodigious concentration of fruit, but I suspect it is normal in the scheme of oenological measurement. This profound wine requires 3-4 years of cellaring, and should age well for 30-35 years.

A genius for sure, Angelo Gaja can not be faulted for what he puts in the bottle. This work of art is worth every cent it will fetch. Importer: Paterno Imports, Lake Bluff, IL; tel. (847) 604-89000",,RP 93
2318,Domaine Paul Pillot,Sori Tildin,"The awesome 1997 Sori Tilden (10,000 bottles produced) is a candidate for perfection. The saturated purple color is followed by a dense, full-bodied wine possessing extraordinary vibrancy for such a heavyweight, muscular Nebbiolo. It offers a super-sweet entry, a boatload of glycerin, and notes of earth, licorice, cedar, blackberry and cherry liqueur, and a touch of blueberries. Extremely full, gorgeously pure, with a seamless texture, this spectacular 1997 will enjoy three decades of cellaring.

2319,Domaine Paul Pillot,Sori San Lorenzo,"Profound, the 1997 Sori San Lorenzo is an elegant, nuanced, and complex Gaja offering. It exhibits a striking perfume of lead pencil, roasted nuts, black fruits, spice box, leather, cedar, and Chinese black tea. Forward yet enormously constituted and rich, with an ethereal elegance underpinning its personality, the Sori Lorenzo displays a classic combination of power and finesse. Sadly, there are only 10,000 bottles. As this wine sat in the glass, notes of Japanese soy sauce made an appearance. Anticipated maturity: 2002-2030.

2320,Domaine Paul Pillot,Conteisa,"The 1997 Conteisa offers classic aromas of licorice, melted tar, black cherries, wet stones, and tobacco. It is a full-bodied, unctuously-textured wine of remarkable density and thickness. The tannin is high, but sweet. This brawny offering cuts an immense swath across the palate, but there are no hard edges and all the component parts are pure as well as well-integrated. There are 15,000 bottles of this spectacular wine. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2030.

2321,Domaine Paul Pillot,Costa Russi,"The opaque ruby/purple-colored 1997 Costa Russi (10,000 bottles produced) displays a striking bouquet of blackberry and cherry fruit intermixed with espresso and wood scents. Typically the most internationally-styled Gaja offering, the 1997 comes across as a Nebbiolo on steroids. Full-bodied, gorgeously pure and symmetrical, it should be at its best between 2002-2025.

2322,Domaine Paul Pillot,Barbaresco,"Gaja's 1997 Barbaresco is undoubtedly the finest he has yet made. An exquisite effort, it boasts a dense ruby/purple color in addition to an extraordinary nose of black cherry liqueur, smoke, licorice, mineral, and floral aromas. The wine is full-bodied, opulent, and loaded with fruit. Despite its precocious nature, there is abundant tannin, and thus 3-4 years of cellaring is required. It should age effortlessly for 25 years.

2323,Domaine Paul Pillot,Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon,"There are 1,000 cases of the exceptional, black/purple-colored 1997 Darmagi Cabernet Sauvignon (3-4% Cabernet Franc was added to the blend). With abundant quantities of smoky, concentrated fruit as well as tannin, the vintage's low acid, thick, glycerin-imbued character, and a layered, full-bodied finish, it should develop nicely for two decades.

2324,Domaine Paul Pillot,Sori San Lorenzo,"The dense opaque purple-colored 1996 Sori San Lorenzo possesses complex aromatics, consisting of classic Nebbiolo scents of rose petals, dried herbs, spice box, cedar, and abundant jammy black cherry and berry fruit. It is impressively powerful and muscular, with moderate tannin, a sweet, unctuous texture, and a 40+ second finish. Although the aromatics are stunning, this 1996 remains youthful and backward. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2025. 

As I reported in issue #124 (8-27-99), 1996 is a spectacular vintage for Angelo Gaja. There is a lot of speculation as to why he has dropped the name Barbaresco from the labels of his single-vineyard wines, but given his personality and overall commitment to quality, it can only be to improve the quality and give him some flexibility in difficult vintages to produce a wine that may or may not be 100% Nebbiolo. At least that's how I view it.

The 2013 Chassagne Montrachet 1Er Cru les Caillerets has a sophisticated and tensile nose, shimmering citrus fruit, granite and smoke aromas, a little terse at first, it soon loses its aloofness and becomes very engaging. The palate is very well balanced with a silver bead of acidity that cuts through the lightly honeyed fruit. There is impressive focus here, likewise impressive length, completing this class act.

The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Grande Montagne has a lot of reduction on the nose, perhaps too much, occluding terroir expression and sense of place. The palate is concentrated with a keen line of acidity -- weight in the mouth here with plenty of citrus fruit and spice towards the finish. If it can shake off that reduction with bottle age then this could turn out to be a fine Chassagne-Montrachet. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (93-95)
2375,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Grandes Ruchottes,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Grandes Ruchottes had a lot of sulfur dioxide on the nose, rendering it difficult to read the terroir here. Some of it does blow off with 10-15 minutes in the glass, but it still feels rather generic. The palate offers grapefruit and quince on the entry. The acidity is nicely judged, but it is missing some complexity and nuance on the curt finish. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (93-95)
2376,Domaine Paul Pillot,St Aubin 1er Cru les Charmois,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 St Aubin 1er Cru les Charmois has an earthy, slightly green nose that lacks the clarity of pedigree of Jean-Claude Bachelet's own Charmois. There is a touch of boiled asparagus here. The palate is fresh on the entry, but it lacks substance and it feels a little thin and simple towards the finish. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (93-95)
2377,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne Montrachet 1Er Cru les Champs Gain,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Champs Gain was perhaps the most backward of Pillot's wines that I tried, but it appears to possess the most complexity and nuance, adorned with flint and smoke aromas, a touch of walnut with aeration. The palate is fresh and sprightly on the entry. There is a taut line of acidity here, quite Chablis-like in style right through to the saline finish. This has real class and I suspect it will evolve into a beautiful, sophisticated Chassagne-Montrachet. ",,RP (93-95)
2378,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean has a composed, mineral-rich, Puligny-like bouquet that revs up in the glass and achieves impressive vigor and focus. The palate is crisp and taut, a fine bead of acidity here, strict and linear but with plenty of fresh green apple, pear and nectarine decorating the finish. This comes recommended and should give 8-12 years of drinking pleasure. ",,RP (93-95)
2379,Domaine Paul Pillot,Puligny-Montrachet Les Enseignères,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet Les Enseignères has a crisp bouquet with apple blossom and lime scents, a hint of granite just in the background. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, a touch of sour lemon on the entry, nice tension on the edgy finish with sufficient salinity to beg another sip. ",,RP (93-95)
2380,Domaine Paul Pillot,St Aubin 1er Cru les Charmois,"The 2014 Saint Aubin 1er Cru les Charmois has a seductive, quite perfumed bouquet with white and yellow flower scents filtering through the citrus fruit. The palate is crisp and vibrant--edgy for a Saint Aubin with lemon peel and freshly sliced pear fanning out gently on the finish. This comes recommended. ",,RP (93-95)
2381,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne Montrachet les Mazures,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet les Mazures has a well defined bouquet with scents of white peach and apricot blossom--timid at first but gaining confidence in the glass with each swirl. The palate is fresh on the entry, soft in the mouth, quite plush with lemon peel and orange zest, a touch of ginger on the back palate. It maybe just lacks the coup de grace on the finish that would have completed this wine, but it is still a good effort. ",,RP (93-95)
2382,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet Village,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet Village has a pretty bouquet, quite intense for a village cru, scents of citrus lemon, beeswax and a touch of honeysuckle all nicely defined. The palate is missing a little depth on the entry, seems to ""skim across the surface"" with a rather conservative finish. It's not a bad Chassagne-Montrachet, but it needs more mineralité and personality to evolve in bottle. ",,RP (93-95)
2383,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée has a pretty nose with citrus fruit, yellow plum, baking powder and mineral scents that are all nicely combined. The palate is fresh, poised and demonstrated good weight, perhaps more backward than its peers and therefore needing a little more cohesion. However, there is impressive matière in this wine and with two or three more years in the cellar could evolve into an enticing proposition. This is a great Chassagne-Montrachet from the Domaine. ",,RP (93-95)
2384,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Caillerets from Domaine Paul Pillot has a detailed, mineral-driven bouquet that is nicely focused, slightly fumé in style with candied orange peel emerging with continued aeration. The palate is well balanced with mandarin and a pinch of spice on the entry. There is good weight and fruit concentration here, a keen line of acidity though the finish needs to forage a touch more finesse, which in fact it does with about fifteen minutes aeration in the glass. I have faith in this Chassagne-Montrachet so give it three or four more years in the cellar. ",,RP (93-95)
2385,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Grande Montagne,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru La Grand Montagne is slightly smudged on the nose with light lime and tertiary notes that seem very ""contained"". The palate is medium-bodied with a pleasant tangy note on the entry thanks to the orange peel and light spice notes, but it does not really follow through with sufficient conviction, missing some delineation on the finish that prevents it from meriting a higher score. ",,RP (93-95)
2386,Domaine Paul Pillot,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Le Charmois,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 St Aubin 1er Cru Les Charmois from Paul Pillot has a well-defined bouquet with white flower and citrus scents, a touch of honeysuckle developing with time. The palate is fresh on the entry and just shows a little reduction. There is good weight here with a lively spicy, orange peel finish. Gentle and appealing, enjoy this Saint Aubin over the next 6-8 years. ",,RP (93-95)
2387,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée 2011  is austere and minerally on the nose, reticent at the moment, but unfolding in the glass with great precision and intent. The palate is clean and fresh with vibrant citrus fruit, a dash of lemongrass and a real prickle of spice toward the engaging and vivacious finish. There is very good persistence here, and it certainly put Pillot’s Grands Ruchottes completely in the shade.",,RP (93-95)
2388,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne Montrachet 1Er Cru les Caillerets,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Although there is noticeable oak on the nose of the Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru les Caillerets 2011 from Paul Pillot, it is in sync with the fruit and is very well defined. The palate is clean and fresh with precise acidity: plenty of fresh lime and green apples with touches of lemongrass coming through. Good weight and concentration, this is a vivacious Caillerets that should age well. ",,RP (93-95)
2389,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Grandes Ruchottes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chassagne-Montrachet les Grandes Ruchottes 2011 from Paul Pillot has quite a lot of reduction on the nose, but there appears to be good fruit concentration and delineation here. The palate is chalky on the entry with bitter lemon and grapefruit notes. It tapers away during the finish so that you end up feeling a little short-changed. ",,RP (93-95)
2390,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Grandes Ruchottes,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Grandes Ruchottes is a tad more reticent than the Les Caillerets but it opens nicely with lime flower and fresh pear scents. The palate is nicely balanced with a fine citric core of fruit, touches of dried apricot and quince; then eases down toward a refined, quite feminine finish.

2391,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint Jean felt a little reduced, but opens with rigorous swirling to reveal scents of mint, dried pineapple and quince. The palate is balanced on the entry with touches of dried herbs and spice lining the entry. It needs a little more vigor and penetration at the moment as it seems to “sit back” on the finish.

2392,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Champs Gain,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Champs Gains is more laid back on the nose with lemon peel, limestone and faint smoke aromas that need a little encouragement. The palate is open and generous on the entry with notes of pear and citrus lemon, building gently toward a ripe orange zest-tinged finish, though it needs to muster more tension and persistency to really convince that it is top flight.

It has a very expressive bouquet with dewy green apples and cold stone, a hint of nettle emerging with time. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a silvery thread of citric acidity and a harmonious, precise finish that is both pretty and shows good breeding. This is an excellent Chassagne worth seeking out. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (93-95)
2395,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean,"The Clos St.-Jean ’10 has an initially reticent bouquet that demands coaxing, but unveils attractive grass clipping and undergrowth aromas with time. You do wish the aromatics would “Gee up” a bit because the palate is worth investigating. Crisp and primal on the entry, linear and almost Zen-like with a Puligny-inspired finish, this is a crisp, taut Chassagne that is already appealing. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (93-95)
2396,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Cailleret,"Like the Clos St.-Jean ’10, the Caillerets has a bashful nose that needs patience before those lovely, airy, limestone scents begin to emerge. The palate has an engaging mineral-infused entry that lends it a Leflaive-like persona. There is good weight in the mouth, although the finish shows just a touch of attenuation. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (93-95)
2397,Domaine Paul Pillot,Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Le Charmois,"The 2010 Les Charmois would benefit from a little more delineation on the nose, although the subtle tropical notes augmented by jasmine are attractive. The palate has a zesty, lime-tinged entry with good weight in the mouth, though the finish is comparatively straightforward next to its peers. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (93-95)
2398,Domaine Paul Pillot,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée,"The Chassagne-Montrachet La Romanee is a wonderful wine. Smoke and minerals can be discerned on its nose, followed by a wide, fat, medium-to-full-bodied core of buttery stones, currants, sweet oak, and pears. Complex, concentrated, extremely well-balanced and defined, this wine's mid-palate is as rich and full-flavored as its attack and finish. Anticipated maturity: 2001-2008.

As with the La Grande Montagne, this wine has a slight hollowness on the mid-palate. This being said, I was impressed by its thick, ripe, highly-focused, and complex medium-to-full body and its layers of stone, cardamon, and minerals. It should be consumed between 1999 and 2004.

2427,O'Shaughnessy,Merlot,"The 2005 Merlot Howell Mountain is terrific. Notes of mocha, melted chocolate, smoked herbs, and loads of cherry and black currant fruit dominate this dark ruby/purple-colored, full-bodied Merlot. Silky tannins and juicy acidity give uplift to this wine, which cuts a broad, savory mouthfeel. Drink it over the next decade. 

A I said last year, this relatively new producer is off to a flying start. Winemaker Sean Capiaux (who has his own Pinot Noir operation) seems to be doing some stunning work with this 35-acre vineyard, planted with 29 acres of Cabernet and the rest other Bordeaux varietals. There is also a small cuvee (under 1,000 cases) of Cabernet Sauvignon from Mt. Veeder. Tasting through some barrel samples of 2006 showed this to be a very fine vintage, if not up to the level of 2005 and 2004, at least at this stage in their development.

2491,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie,"Bursting with aromas of cherries, raspberries, sweet soil tones and licorice, the 2018 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie is medium-bodied, bright and lively, with an elegantly fine-boned profile even in this inherently powerful vintage. It's a terrific cuvée from Eric Germain and his team.",,RP 92
2492,Vincent Girardin,Beaune 1er Cru Les Aigrots,"Aromas of dark cherries, baking chocolate and rich soil tones introduce the 2018 Beaune 1er Cru Les Aigrots, a medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy wine with an ample core of fruit and powdery structuring tannins. This will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP 92
2493,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Casses-Têtes,"Aromas of white flowers, crisp yellow orchard fruit, toasted almonds and crushed stones introduce the 2018 Meursault Les Casses-Têtes, a medium to full-bodied, ample but precise wine with a fleshy core of fruit, brisk acids and a bright, saline finish.",,RP 92
2494,Vincent Girardin,Volnay 1er Cru Les Pitures,"The 2018 Volnay 1er Cru Les Pitures offers up aromas of raspberries, plums, rose petals and sweet soil tones. Medium-bodied, bright and lively, it's fine-boned and mineral, with bright acids and powdery tannins. This is a pretty, perfumed Volnay that demonstrates what a timely harvest and judicious winemaking could achieve in 2018.",,RP 92
2495,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Grands Charrons,"The 2018 Meursault Les Grands Charrons has turned out nicely, mingling aromas of pear, fresh bread, green apple, white flowers and buttery pastry in an inviting mélange. Medium to full-bodied, layered and nicely concentrated, it's lively and elegantly textural, concluding with a saline finish.",,RP 92
2496,Vincent Girardin,Volnay Les Vieilles Vignes,"Offering up pretty aromas of red berries, plums, orange rind and spice, the 2017 Volnay Les Vieilles Vignes is medium-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with a fleshy core of fruit, melting tannins and succulent acids. It's already drinking well.",,RP 92
2497,Vincent Girardin,Bourgogne Cuvée Saint-Vincent,"Offering up delicate aromas of plums, spices and potpourri, the 2017 Bourgogne Cuvée Saint-Vincent is medium-bodied, round and charming, with supple tannins, a pretty core of fruit and succulent acids. It's drinking well.",,RP 92
2498,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Vieilles Vignes,"Offering up an inviting bouquet of red cherries, smoked meats, musk and spices, the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet Les Vieilles Vignes is medium-bodied, supple and open-knit, with a pretty core of fruit, powdery tannins and succulent acids, concluding with a sapid finish.",,RP 92
2499,Vincent Girardin,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is also superb. Offering up a deep and complex bouquet of citrus oil, pear, oatmeal, beeswax and wheat toast, framed by a subtle touch of reduction, the wine is full-bodied, dense and multidimensional, with a racy spine of acidity underpinning its layered, muscular core, concluding with a long and vibrant finish. ""It's a vintage adapted to this vineyard,"" observes Germain, and it's hard to dissent. From barrel, I thought the Chevalier had the edge, but from bottle, I'm inclined to favor the Bâtard. Readers should note that this cuvée derives from a different source from the Girardin wines of yesteryear.",,RP 92
2500,Vincent Girardin,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Unfortunately, there are a mere 25 cases of the 2017 Montrachet Grand Cru, but readers lucky enough to secure a bottle or two are in for a treat. Unfurling in the glass with aromas of peach, citrus blossom, honeycomb, warm bread and anise, it's full-bodied, layered and immensely enveloping, its satiny and caressing attack segueing into a deep, concentrated core. Long and complete, this is a brilliant rendition of this great vineyard. Readers should note that, like the Bâtard, this derives from a different source from the Girardin Montrachets of yesteryear.",,RP 92
2501,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Blanchots Dessus,"I underestimated the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Blanchots Dessus when I tasted it from barrel, because it emerged as one of the finest wines in the cellar when revisited from bottle. Wafting from the glass with notes of citrus oil, mandarin, white flowers, clear honey and fresh pastry, framed by a deft touch of reduction, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with superb concentration, a racy spine of acidity and a long, penetrating finish. This is just as tensile and incisive as the Romanée this year, but it also carries even more texture and mid-palate volume. Girardin farms this parcel, which is located next to the late Jean-Claude Bachelet's.",,RP 92
2502,Vincent Girardin,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru wafts from the glass with scents of citrus oil, toasted nuts, white flowers and nutmeg. Full-bodied, multidimensional and layered, this is chiseled and racy, finer-boned than the Bâtard and just as penetrating, though seemingly just a touch less deep and profound. That's splitting hairs, as both are playing at a very high level this year.",,RP 92
2503,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was showing brilliantly, blossoming in the glass with scents of pear, white currants, crisp green apple, dried white flowers and a subtle framing of new oak. Full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, for all this wine's texture it is its racy acidity and compelling sense of energy that lend it its distinction. This is a concentrated, beautifully balanced Bienvenues that is well worth seeking out.",,RP 92
2504,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée,"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée confirms its superb showing from barrel, mingling scents of green apple, melon and citrus with hints of pastry cream and wet stones. Medium to full-bodied, deep and satiny, it's more introverted and structured than the Caillerets, underpinned by a racy spine of acidity. The finish is long and penetrating.",,RP 92
2505,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières is performing brilliantly, unwinding in the glass with a textbook bouquet of citrus oil, crisp green apple, Anjou pear, mandarin oil, crushed chalk and struck flint. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, it's muscular but tight-knit, with racy acids, excellent concentration and a long, mineral finish. From 65-year-old vines planted on the SO4 rootstock, Germain tells me this parcel isn't very vigorous and always gives tiny yields.",,RP 92
2506,Vincent Girardin,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru Quintessence de Corton-Charlemagne,"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru Quintessence de Corton-Charlemagne was one of the most introverted wines in the range when I revisited it from bottle, unwinding to reveal scents of pear, white flowers, confit citrus and a delicate top note of petrol. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a deep and intensely concentrated core, but it's still very reserved after its recent bottling. Some patience will be in order here, though at maturity, I'm sure my score will look conservative.",,RP 92
2507,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes Dessus,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes Dessus was showing even better in bottle, unwinding in the glass with notes of pear, citrus zest, wheat toast, nutmeg and anise. Medium to full-bodied, concentrated and textural, there's more substance and structure here than I perceived, with plenty of racy acidity too. Long and saline, this is a serious Charmes. Germain told me that 80% of this cuvée is produced from the domaine's holdings, with the balance coming from a parcel they farm and harvest.",,RP 92
2508,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières bursts with aromas of citrus oil, mandarin and crisp yellow apples mingled with warm brioche, wheat toast and struck flint. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, it's racy and precise, with a crisp core of fruit and a long, penetrating finish.",,RP 92
2509,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes displays scents of white currants, fresh peach, pear, hazelnuts and blanched almonds, followed by a full-bodied, satiny and concentrated palate that's muscular and powerful, though it's also more texturally refined than it was when I tasted it from barrel. Germain notes that this parcel has been converted to Guyot Poulsard pruning and is being farmed organically, so he expects it to improve further.",,RP 92
2510,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Genevrières,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Les Genevrières is also performing well, displaying scents of pear, peach, white flowers and hazelnuts, framed by a subtle touch of reduction. This is medium to full-bodied, tensile and elegantly muscular, with chalky structuring dry extract, lively acids and a long, palate-staining finish. Like the Charmes, this will reward patience. This hails from two parcels, one in each of the two climats of Genevrières.",,RP 92
2511,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets,"Purchased as must from a biodynamic producer, the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Caillerets bursts with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, honeycomb, spices and toasted nuts. Medium to full-bodied, broad and enveloping, with a satiny attack and an ample mid-palate, it's racy and tensile despite its volume, concluding with a saline finish.",,RP 92
2512,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2017 Meursault Les Narvaux has also fulfilled the promise it showed from barrel, wafting from the glass with scents of citrus oil, Anjou pear, hazelnuts and stuck flint. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and satiny, both more textural and more introverted than the Tillets—and note that it was among the last wines in the cellar to be bottled—with racy acids and a long, saline finish.",,RP 92
2513,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Notes of peach, fresh pastry, anise, white flowers and both confit and fresh citrus introduce the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles, a full-bodied, enveloping and textural wine that's lively and fleshy. Tasted from bottle, this is among the more extrovert of Germain's 2017 premiers crus.",,RP 92
2514,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"Aromas of white currants, pear, dried white flowers and wheat toast introduce the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts, a medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping wine underpinned by racy acids, concluding with promising back-end grip. Germain tells me that this cuvée is purchased as must and comes from 60-year-old vines that are farmed according to ""lutte raisonnée.""",,RP 92
2515,Vincent Girardin,Corton-Perrières Grand Cru,"The most serious of these reds is the 2017 Corton-Perrières Grand Cru, a wine that unwinds in the glass with notes of red berries, cassis and spices. Medium to full-bodied, deep and nicely concentrated, with the most mid-palate volume of any wine in the range, this will reward a bit of bottle age.",,RP 92
2516,Vincent Girardin,Pommard 1er Cru Les Epenots,"One of the high points on the red side of the ledger is the 2017 Pommard 1er Cru Les Epenots, a fleshy, ample, medium to full-bodied wine that evokes notions of plums, peonies and coniferous forest floor. It has turned out very well.",,RP 92
2517,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Le Tesson,"From a parcel of young vines between Fichet and Bouzereau, the 2017 Meursault Le Tesson offers up notes of pear, confit citrus, fresh peach and hazelnuts, followed by a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping palate that's lively and precise. This is a riper, though nicely controlled, expression than the Tillets and Narvaux that preceded it, displaying a touch more texture and overt fruit.",,RP 92
2518,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Tillets,"Offering up aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, citrus oil, pastry cream and nutmeg, the 2017 Meursault Les Tillets is medium to full-bodied, racy and tensile, with an elegantly textural attack, excellent depth at the core and a long, mineral finish. This hails from domaine holdings in the heart of the climat, where the soils are poor and vines suffering from degeneration deliver routinely low yields.",,RP 92
2519,Vincent Girardin,Volnay 1er Cru Les Champans,"Mingling scents of red berries and plums with notes of rose petal and spice, the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Champans is medium to full-bodied, open and melting—especially by the standards of a climat that often produces muscular wines. Perfumed and lively, it will drink well young.",,RP 92
2520,Vincent Girardin,Volnay 1er Cru Les Pitures,"Offering up scents of red berries, flowers, spices and soil tones, the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Pitures is medium to full-bodied, tangy and acid-driven, with a pretty core of fruit framed by powdery tannins.",,RP 92
2521,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet Les Vieilles Vignes,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet Les Vieilles Vignes is still a little shut down after bottling, opening in the glass with notes of white peach, orange oil, wheat toast and pastry cream. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with a delicately textural attack, lively acids and a long, precise finish. Even though this is one of the house's more accessible cuvées, it will really reward a year or two of bottle age with greater plenitude and expression.",,RP 92
2522,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie,"Bursting with aromas of berries, spices, sweet soil tones and peonies, the 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Maltroie is medium to full-bodied, fleshy and open-knit, with a supple chassis of tannin and a ripe core of fruit. This is already drinking well.",,RP 92
2523,Vincent Girardin,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"The 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots offers up aromas of red berries, peonies, smoked meats and a deft framing of toasty new oak, followed by a medium to full-bodied, lively palate that's supple and delicate. Forward and expressive, this will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP 92
2524,Vincent Girardin,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of buttered orchard fruit, ripe lemons and blanched almonds, the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a broad-shouldered, powerful profile, chewy structuring dry extract and racy acids, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. This is a very persuasive wine from Girardin.",,RP 92
2525,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts wafts from the glass with lovely aromas of ripe lemons, crisp orchard fruit, blanched almonds and pastry cream, delicately framed by oak vanillin. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and expansive, with a broad, textural attack, superb concentration and tangy acids, concluding with a long, penetrating and precise finish. Intense and incisive, this is one of Eric Germain's finest 2016 whites.",,RP 92
2526,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret opens in the glass with pretty notions of crisp orchard fruit, Meyer lemon, blanched almonds and citrus blossom, framed by a very subtle touch of classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with a textural attack and striking volume, revealing excellent concentration, racy acids and a long, precise finish. This is an excellent Cailleret that combines power and tension.",,RP 92
2527,Vincent Girardin,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots,"Lavish aromas of blackberries, rose petal and grilled game bird preface the 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots, a medium to full-bodied, broad and expansive wine with a velvety chassis of structuring tannin, an ample and sapid core of fruit, tangy acids and a long, fragrant finish. This is a gourmand but precise Santenots from Eric Germain that is showing very well indeed.",,RP 92
2528,Vincent Girardin,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Grand Cru is one of the more reserved reds in the range, unfurling to reveal aromas of red cherries and berry fruit intermingled with hints of spice and potpourri. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and tight-knit, with a firm but fine-grained chassis of structuring tannin, brisk acids and a long, mineral finish.",,RP 92
2529,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean,"Bursting from the glass with expressive aromas of berry fruit compote and dried flowers, the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos Saint-Jean is medium to full-bodied, supple and succulent, with an ample core of fruit, melting tannins and tangy acids, concluding with a precise and delicately fragrant finish. This captures all the site's inherent fleshiness but none of the potential structural rusticity that so often accompanies it. Its gourmand, lavish profile makes it already irresistible.",,RP 92
2530,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Boudriotte,"Aromas of violets, berry fruit, dark chocolate and spices introduce the 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Boudriotte, a medium to full-bodied wine with a generous core of succulent fruit, framed by powdery tannins and tangy acids. The finish is pure, precise and perfumed. If I'm inclined to give the edge to the more gourmand Clos Saint-Jean, this wine is the more intellectual choice, and its tannic structure suggests more potential upside.",,RP 92
2531,Vincent Girardin,Pommard 1er Cru Les Epenots,"The 2016 Pommard 1er Cru Les Epenots unfurls in the glass with aromas of dark cherries, cassis, loamy soil, woodsmoke and a subtle hint of dried herbs. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with bright acids and youthfully chewy tannins that assert themselves on the finish. This is a nicely balanced Epenots that will demand a bit of bottle age.",,RP 92
2532,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières bursts with expressive aromas of peaches, tangerine, white flowers, subtle spices and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, fleshy and textural, with a lavishly satiny attack, ripe acids and an attractively precise, saline finish. This doesn't display the cut or tension of the 2017 rendition, but it's a pretty Folatières that will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP 92
2533,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2016 Meursault Les Narvaux unfurls in the glass with notes of waxy lemon rind, grapefruit pith, crisp green pear and dried white flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and satiny, with a textural attack, a pure and vibrant core of fruit, brisk acids and a precise finish.",,RP 92
2534,Vincent Girardin,Beaune 1er Cru Les Aigrots,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Aigrots offers up a rich, fruit-driven bouquet of maraschino cherry, dried flowers and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and succulent, with a fine-grained but firm chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the long, sappy finish.",,RP 92
2535,Vincent Girardin,Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières,"Aromas of black cherries, blackberries and cassis mingling with menthol and dark chocolate introduce the 2016 Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières, a medium to full-bodied, characterful wine with a deep core of wild fruit, youthfully chewy structuring tannins and bright balancing acids.",,RP 92
2536,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Blagny,"From a 1.15-hectare parcel that's part of the domaine holdings, the 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Blagny reveals aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, lemon and white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and stony, with a lovely silky texture, beautiful purity and a mineral finish.",,RP 92
2537,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées,"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées reveals aromas of crisp green pear, toasted nuts, spices and honey, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping palate that's tangy, precise and penetrating. This is a classy, deftly balanced Chaumées that should offer a broad drinking window.",,RP (90-92)
2538,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Grands Charrons,"From a parcel of 60-year-old vines, the 2017 Meursault Les Grands Charrons is one of the fleshier, richer lieux-dits in the range, though it's still true to the racy contemporary Girardin style. Notes of mandarin, pear, almond paste and honeysuckle preface a medium-bodied, concentrated and textural wine with brisk balancing acids and a long, pure finish.",,RP (90-92)
2539,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Clous,"From a hectare of domaine holdings that has been biodynamically farmed for the last three years, the 2017 Meursault Les Clous reveals an attractive bouquet of Anjou pear, lemon oil, white flowers and drawn butter. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, tangy and tensile, with a pure, mineral-driven profile that's defined by its hillside origins.",,RP (90-92)
2540,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts has a fresh and vibrant bouquet with wonderfully delineated cold stone and Granny Smith apple scents, just a faint oiliness present, not unlike Thai fish oil. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a fine line of acidity. There was superb brightness and energy conveyed by this Puligny, and it just sings on the shimmering finish. This is a Les Referts with great potential.",,RP (90-92)
2541,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a crisp, chalky and focused bouquet that gradually opens in the glass. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a killer thread of acidity, impressive salinity and an intense, much more Bâtard-Montrachet-inspired finish that lingers long in the mouth. This did improve in the glass, gaining a little more precision although in tandem, the oak became a bit ""loud-mouthed"" on the finish, hence my prudent score.",,RP (90-92)
2542,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru le Cailleret,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru le Cailleret has a relatively simple bouquet with lemon rind, green apple and cold stone notes, although it needs to demonstrate more intensity. After 15 minutes, there is a light tinned-peach scent. The palate is well balanced with a touch of peach on the entry, lime and tinned apricot here. It feels a little obvious, and although it is nicely balanced, I would have liked to see more mineralité on the finish—the same sentiment accorded to the Cailleret from Paul Pillot that was included within the same flight.",,RP (90-92)
2543,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, the 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières has a pretty white peach/peach skin, honeysuckle and passion fruit-scented bouquet that is very attractive although you could well argue that it fails to articulate the mineralité of Les Perrières. The palate is well balanced with fresh acidity, quite saline toward the second half as if the wine has suddenly remembered where it comes from and it finishes with a lovely twist of sour lemon. This is a multifaceted and quite mercurial Meursault from Girardin.",,RP (90-92)
2544,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes du Dessus,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes du Dessus has an intense nose of lime and citrus fruit, perhaps not quite as complex or as terroir-driven as the Meursault Charmes from Coche-Bizouard. The palate is lively on the entry with a light smear of wild honey, segueing into a delicately spiced and quite concentrated finish. It will require another couple of years in bottle although I caution that it did seem to become more advanced and lose some of its luster in the glass with aeration.",,RP (90-92)
2545,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne Montrachet les Chaumées 1er Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Chassagne Montrachet les Chaumées 1er Cru has a clean, precise, minerally bouquet with pleasant chalk dust aromas filtering through the citrus fruit. I admire the definition and focus of this 2014. The palate is very well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, demonstrating judicious use of oak that allows the terroir to shine through on the finish. There is something ""commercial"" about this Chassagne-Montrachet but you would still finish a bottle.",,RP (90-92)
2546,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Girardin's 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes was one of the few in this flight that showed a little too much new oak on the nose, and this dampened down the terroir expression. The palate is balanced with lime and green apple notes, the acidity well judged and with good weight on the slightly honeyed, tropical-tinged finish. It just lacks the complexity and the energy expressed by its peers.",,RP (90-92)
2547,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenue Batard Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru has a more expressive bouquet than Jean-Claude Bachelet's with greater delineation and poise, scents of orange sorbet and spice coming through with time. The palate is fresh on the entry, a powerful and flavor-rich Bienvenue with a citrus-fresh and quite spicy finish. While there might be a touch of botrytis here, it does not obscure precision and elevates this Grand Cru to a higher level. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2548,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru les Genevrieres,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières was showing a bit of vanilla new oak on the nose, although that will be assimilated with another 2-3 years in bottle. It opens nicely with yellow plum, peach skin and apricot aromas that seem to blossom with aeration. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, very citrus-driven with lemon peel dominating the mid palate. I appreciate the weight in the mouth and though the finish still feels a little closed, I suggest that with bottle age this will turn into a fine Genevrières from Girardin. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2549,Vincent Girardin,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Combottes,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes has a crisp, mineral-driven bouquet that demonstrated impressive precision and succinct use of oak. This just sings of Puligny. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, vibrant and lively with plenty of citrus fruit, a pinch of spice towards the finish that gently fans out. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2550,Vincent Girardin,Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru offers a clean, fresh bouquet with citrus fruit, yellow flowers and a touch of walnut. The palate is crisp and fresh on the entry with good weight. There is not an enormous amount of complexity here, although the feisty and spicy finish is quite appealing. I would be inclined to drink this in its youth rather than with age, but the mineralité eventually shows through and lifts the wine to a higher level. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2551,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes du Dessus,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes du Dessus demanded coaxing from the glass, eventually revealing attractive notes of dried lemon peel, lanolin and a tang of marmalade. The palate is well balanced with a crisp line of acidity. Lime and lemon at first, soon joined by orange peel and walnut. There is moderate weight in the mouth and a generous dash of spice washing over the finish. This is a very decent Meursault from Girardin. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2552,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru les Perrieres,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières has a detailed, complex bouquet with walnut, smoke and linseed complementing the citrus fruit and cold stone scents. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, touches of nectarine and bitter lemon, oyster shell and spice. Moderate weight in the mouth, this is nicely focused and persistent in the mouth, yet it just falls a little short of the best Meursault Perrieres in this vintage. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2553,Vincent Girardin,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatieres,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières has a slightly muddled bouquet that lacks precision, more resinous than its peers with baked apple notes coming through with aeration suggesting an early picking. The palate is well balanced but not the most complex, with bitter lemon and orange rind, a pinch of spice, yet it is missing a little clarity on the finish. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2554,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne Montrachet le Cailleret,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru le Cailleret has a clean and precise bouquet, fine mineralité if not the complexity of some of the best Chassagne-Montrachets. The palate is fresh on the entry with green apple and pear, a dash of spice, but it feels a little austere on the finish and with aeration, it comes across as a little one-dimensional.

2555,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne Montrachet la Romanee,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru La Romanée has a very candied and dare I say, quite commercial nose. Attractive in its own way, yet a little facile compared to its peers. The palate is balanced, rounded, easy-drinking, full of tropical fruit but missing real tension and complexity on the finish. You might call this a ""punter's Chassagne-Montrachet""?

The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées has a much more exotic bouquet than others, offering ripe mango and melon aromas on the nose, even a touch of lavender that emerges with time. The palate is rounded on the entry, not as detailed as I would have hoped, primal and missing a little flair and sophistication on the finish, especially considering that this is a premier cru. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (90-92)
2557,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Combottes from Vincent Girardin might be one of his best offerings in this vintage. It has tropical tones on the nose, peaches and cream that ebb with aeration, veering towards more resinous, almost waxy notes with aeration. The palate is ripe on the entry with well-judged acidity. There is clearly impressive weight in the mouth, a more phenolic and slightly worked Puligny, but there the finish shows great tension and intensity. I would afford this Combottes another year or two in bottle and you'll have a serious wine. ",,RP (90-92)

The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Caillerets from Vincent Girardin has a generous, fruit-driven nose that is less mineral-driven, but nevertheless is well defined with touches of yellow flower and lemon curd developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied and shows more class than the aromatics: fine acidity here, citrus fresh with orange sorbet and lemon zest defining the long and sustained finish. Once the nose develops more sophistication this will be a very ""able"" Chassagne-Montrachet.",,RP (90-92)

The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet les Chaumées 1er Cru has a slightly disjointed bouquet with stronger pear and gooseberry scents coming through, though nicely defined. The palate is crisp and fresh with well judged acidity, freshly squeezed lime and green apple dovetailing into a detailed finish with commendable tension and length. This is an impressive showing.",,RP (90-92)
2560,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières  from Vincent Girardin has a more floral bouquet with a hint of peppermint and broom complementing the citrus fruit that is nicely delineated. The palate is pointed and a little shrill on the entry. There is a strong marine influence surfacing towards the finish with a twist of sour lemon lingering on the aftertaste. It needs to settle and find its groove so I would afford this another three or four years in the cellar. ,,RP (90-92)
2561,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes-Dessus,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes du Dessus from Vincent Girardin has a rather feisty nose with hints of peppermint and orange sorbet that unfolds gradually in the glass. The palate does not quite deliver the finesse of the nose and feels just a little attenuated at the moment. Perhaps it will gain more presence with time, but at the moment, this is a Meursault Charmes that is not quite firing on all cylinders. ",,RP (90-92)
2562,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Referts from Vincent Girardin is showing a little SO2 on the nose, gentle at first, with scents of lemon curd and bruised apple emerging from the sulphur haze. The palate is fresh on the entry with a keen thread of acidity. It is not a complex Puligny-Montrachet, quite malic in style with green apple and citrus fruit lining the straight-laced, slightly oaky finish. Not bad - but it is not the best les Referts out there.

2563,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru from Vincent Girardin does not possess the same focus as Jean-Claude Bachelet’s and is not as immediate. However, it does improve with aeration in the glass and develop attractive chalk, almost flinty scents with time. palate is fresh and crisp with a fine line of acidity, nicely poised in the mouth but without the same complexity as Bachelet’s. Perhaps this has more to give in the future? Cellar it for four or five years and see what evolves in bottle. ",,RP (90-92)
2564,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières from Vincent Girardin is showing a little more oak on the nose compared to its peers with touches of patisserie, almond and coconut complementing the citrus fruit. The palate is fresh and crisp with a fine line of acidity, just tapering towards the tropical finish that indicates elements of botrytis. I prefer other releases from Girardin in this year.  ",,RP (90-92)
2565,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières from Vincent Girardin has a tropical tinged bouquet with subtle pineapple and guava scents that feel a little obvious. The palate is generous on the entry, not complex but with plenty of flavor that veer towards the tropical, just like the aromatics. Not bad, but this is missing some class and not long-term. It does tend to oxidize on the glass, which is concerning. ",,RP (90-92)
2566,Vincent Girardin,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru from Vincent Girardin has a commercial, punter-friendly bouquet with flecks of white chocolate littered over the citrus fruit, but it becomes oxidised with time. The palate has a disorientating vein of dryness on the entry. This feels a little mean, very linear but it would have benefitted from more weight and delineation on the finish that has a slight sourness. I actually prefer some of Girardin’s white premier cru to this. ",,RP (90-92)
2567,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Pucelles 2011 from Vincent Girardin sports an attractive nose with scents of citrus peel and pink grapefruit. This is imbued with fine minerality, but you have the sense that it is holding something back. The palate is well balanced, slightly honeyed on the entry, a little richer than I expected, and the finish is missing the precision and tension of a top-flight Puligny premier cru. This is a very impressive showing for the Pucelles from Girardin. ",,RP (90-92)
2568,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières from Vicent Girardin has a much more feminine, almost dainty bouquet compared to Bouzereau’s and Comtes-Lafon’s, but I appreciate the detail here and the floral quality that combines nicely with the mineral aromas filtering through with aeration. The palate is tense and vibrant right from the start: a keen thread of acidity here, very good minerality and poise with a flourish of citrus peel, lemongrass and lime toward the persistent finish. This will need 3 or 4 years to fully coalesce, but it will be worth the wait.",,RP (90-92)
2569,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos des Caillerets,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos de Caillerets 2011 has a similar bouquet to Vincent Morey’s with plenty of generous orange blossom and apricot scents, but there is less minerality than Paul Pillot’s own Caillerets. The palate is quite rounded in the mouth with lower acidity, plush and generous with honey, pear drop and orange zest lining the finish. It feels a little “worked” compared to its peers, but it is undeniably well balanced and should age well. ",,RP (90-92)
2570,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières 2011 from Vincent Girardin has a generous and outgoing, but rather straightforward, bouquet with tangerine and apricot blossom scents that are well defined, but do not exactly engage the cerebral membrane. The palate is better than the nose suggests with a fine line of acidity, crisp citrus fruit with touches of dried apricot and quince that dovetail into a poised finish. Give this 3 or 4 years for the aromatics to awaken. ",,RP (90-92)
2571,Vincent Girardin,Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chaumées Clos de la Truffière,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chassagne-Montrachet Chaumées Clos de la Truffière 2011 from Vincent Girardin has excellent definition and focus on the nose: the minerality more conspicuous than the other wines in the flight, ergo the aromatics have more pedigree and class. Coming back later, there are lovely peach skin scents coming through. The palate is clean and fresh with lemon peel, orange zest and a slight sour note on the finish that lends tension and poise. Good length in the mouth. Very fine. ",,RP (90-92)
2572,Vincent Girardin,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Meursault 1er Cru les Genevrières 2011 from Vincent Girardin has a much more exotic bouquet with ripe mango and mandarin aromas that are well defined, but seem too eager to please, and too commercial compared to others in the flight. The palate is unapologetically rich and exotic. There is a lot of concentration on the powerful Meursault, but it lacks the elegance and detail of the previous two wines (Genverières from Olivier Leflaive and Antoine Jobard.) This needs time to sort itself out. ",,RP (90-92)
2573,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru 2011 has a more exotic and generous bouquet that Jean-Claude Bachelet’s furnished with lime, candied apricot and nectarine that is well defined, but comes across as a little more obvious. The palate is clean and fresh with a crisp line of acidity: vibrant lime and fresh white peach. However, I find it a little too sweet on the finish. ",,RP (90-92)
2574,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Like Prieur’s Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Combettes 2011, Girardin’s has a rather odd bouquet with reductive notes: fruit salad and tangerine, later smudged resinous notes developing with aeration. The palate is lightly honeyed on the entry with moderate acidity, lacking tension and grace and certainly with little minerality toward the nondescript finish. ",,RP (90-92)
2575,Vincent Girardin,Pouilly Fuisse,"The 2012 Pouilly Fuissé, which is raised in 500-liter oak barrel for ten months, plus two in stainless steel, has a slightly subdued bouquet, which is frustrating because there are attractive lemon-curd and green-apple notes deep in there. The palate is well-balanced with crisp acidity, citrus fresh, with good tension on the finish, but you feel that this is a Pouilly-Fuissé that just needs to let go a little. Fine, but this could be even better with some bottle age.",,RP (90-92)
2576,Vincent Girardin,Saint Veran,"The 2012 Saint Veran, which is raised in 500-liter oak barrel for ten months, plus two in stainless steel, has a tight-lipped but minerally bouquet that might repay 12 months in bottle. The palate is soft and rounded on the entry with plenty of peachy fruit, however it is missing the tension and complexity promised by the aromatics. ",,RP (90-92)
2577,Vincent Girardin,Pouilly Fuisse,"Slightly better, with more minerality, is the medium-bodied 2011 Pouilly Fuisse (2,000 cases also aged in primarily old French oak casks). It offers up aromas of honeysuckle, white peaches, spring flowers and a stony minerality. Drink it over the next several years.

2579,Vincent Girardin,"Corton-Charlemagne ""Quintessence de Corton-Charlemagne"" Grand Cru","From a parcel in Aloxe, the 2010 Quintessence de Corton-Charlemagne is quite a bit cooler and more reticent than the straight Corton-Charlemagne. White flowers, pears and crushed rocks are all woven together beautifully in this vibrant, deeply expressive Corton-Charlemagne. Ideally, the 2010 needs at least a couple of years for the fruit to emerge. Today, the incisive, crystalline mineral notes are most prominent. The silky, precise finish leaves a strong lasting impression. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.  

Vincent Girardin recently sold his operation to Compagnie des Vins d’Autrefois, which previously had an ownership stake in the company. As part of the transaction, Girardin keeps eight hectares of vineyards, from which he will continue to supply the house. I am told that all the other fruit contracts remain in place, ensuring continuity in the maison’s range. Long-time winemaker Eric Germain, who has worked alongside Girardin for ten years, remains at the helm. So far, it looks like a little has changed, but it is early days so we will see. Germain told me the 2010s were harvested beginning on September 5. The premier and grand crus spent 18 months in oak (20% new), followed by two months in steel before being bottled in April and May 2012. As I wrote last year, the Girardin wines have undergone a pretty dramatic stylistic shift over the last few years. Today, the wines are made in a brighter, more focused style with less of the overt richness and oak influence the winemaking team believes was contributing to the premature evolution of the wines.

2580,Vincent Girardin,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2010 Corton-Charlemagne wraps around the palate with rich, expressive layers of fruit. This is an especially radiant style of Corton-Charlemagne endowed with considerable textural depth and polish. Attractive hints of butter, smoke, slate, mint and white flowers add complexity on the finish. This is a rare Corton-Charlemagne that will drink well with minimum cellaring, although there is more than enough vibrancy to make me think it will also hold up quite well. The Corton is a fairly large cuvee for the house, and is made from a blend of parcels in Pernand-Vergelesses, Aloxe-Corton and Ladoix-Serrigny. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.

It is a gorgeous, complete wine loaded with both fruit and minerality. Accordingly, the Clos du Cailleret needs time to come together. The age of the vines and the high percentage of shot berries contribute to the richness and sheer weight of the fruit. This is a promising wine, but it needs time.

This is typical Perrieres in its cool, mineral notes and taut personality. There is a vibrancy and energy in the Perrieres that is striking. Another year or two in bottle should help the wine come together even more fully. The expressiveness and depth of the finish bodes well for the future. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.

As part of the transaction, Girardin keeps eight hectares of vineyards, from which he will continue to supply the house. I am told that all the other fruit contracts remain in place, ensuring continuity in the maison’s range. Long-time winemaker Eric Germain, who has worked alongside Girardin for ten years, remains at the helm. So far, it looks like a little has changed, but it is early days so we will see. Germain told me the 2010s were harvested beginning on September 5. The premier and grand crus spent 18 months in oak (20% new), followed by two months in steel before being bottled in April and May 2012. As I wrote last year, the Girardin wines have undergone a pretty dramatic stylistic shift over the last few years. Today, the wines are made in a brighter, more focused style with less of the overt richness and oak influence the winemaking team believes was contributing to the premature evolution of the wines.

It boasts a serious core of rich, deep fruit, but the aromatic registers haven’t developed yet. Today, it comes across as a bit heavy and monolithic, perhaps because of the old vines in this parcel.

Girardin has increased the amount of time his wines spend on their lees, has lowered new oak, has eliminated batonnage and has basically re-built his entire approach from the bottom up, which I have to say, is quite impressive. The 2009s were harvested beginning on September 15, with natural alcohols in the 12.5-13% range. The wines were bottled between mid-March and mid-May 2011. Today the 2009s are quite fresh and still showing some of the effects of their recent bottling. It is safe to say the wines Girardin is making today are quite different from those of the past.

Juicy apricots, peaches, spices and crushed rocks meld together nicely in this large-scaled, generous wine. The explosive, mineral-laced finish leaves a lasting impression.

2615,Vincent Girardin,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Scents of iris, lemon oil, orange blossom, and salt spray rise from the glass of 2007 Bienvenue-Batard-Montrachet, whose volume reflects Girardin's ownership of half a hectare, and grapes that he says are routinely – and especially in this vintage – prone to millerandage. A liquid floral essence with at once soothing and invigorating splashes of pineapple juice, nut oils, and ocean water fills the palate, and a sense of crushed stone suffusion adds further complexity to a long, buoyant finish. This has the cut and clarity of a finely-polished gem, yet evinces no sense of austere hardness. It should serve for head-turning over the coming decade. What a year it is for this site! I can't resist mentioning – and why not with this wine? – that while I applaud the classy new (minimalist) label and capsule design on Girardin's wines, I find the heavy, faux antique bottles used for his grand crus – in whose punts I am able to hide my entire, admittedly small, fist – examples of the pretension and environmental excess that too often prevail in matters of glass and marketing. White Burgundy lovers will get their $275 worth out of this gorgeous wine if they will out of any grand cru, packaging aside.

Vincent Girardin picked until past mid-September, with most of his top sites being brought in only from the 10th; allowed skin contact he would have avoided until recent years; and beat the lees on his young wines only until Christmas, but then bottled – with a light fining, and in many instances no filtration – only in May, 2009 to maximize passive time on the lees. The regimen of new wood here (now 20-30% depending on cru) represents a drastic diminution in just the past several years, and the 2007s strike me as far more comfortable in their skins than those of 2004-2006, benefiting also from the freshness and vivacity that characterize the vintage. He picked a week too late in 2006, opines Girardin with hindsight, but then, this was almost unavoidable in at least some instances for a vintner with such huge acreage. Girardin finds his 2007s especially marked by the typicity of each individual site, not only to a greater degree than in the two more obviously ripe preceding vintages, but also than in 2008. This is an aspect he is convinced will gradually be enhanced by a conversion to biodynamic methods that is underway. Girardin's 2007 musts were selectively chaptalized and finished wines here are largely in the vicinity of 13% alcohol. As usual, given the vast array of estate and negociant wines at this address (the latter status noted, where applicable, in my texts), I was not able to take time for tasting them all; in particular omitting the generics.

2616,Vincent Girardin,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"As in so many of the best 2007s, including this from this site, Girardin's 2007 Batard-Montrachet displays striking generosity of ripe, luscious fruit. Quince, white peach, and pineapple are mingled with citrus oils and heady florality in the nose. On the palate, this is bright and downright vivacious, as well as suffused with a diversity and intensity of mineral aspects for which words like ""chalk,"" ""salt,"" or ""iodine,"" represent merely the poor best one can do. This finishes with choral layering and dynamic, and ready to return for the next sip before the music has even died away. Look for ten or a dozen years of fascination and exhilaration.

2617,Vincent Girardin,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Girardin 2007 Chevalier-Montrachet – from a site near the Cabotte – is more adamant as well as more mineral even in the nose than the other wines in this collection. Yet, ripe peach, pineapple, and litchi serve for ample generosity of fruit and juicy brightness in the best vintage manner, while peony and lily assert their floral dimensions. These strands of mineral, fruit, and flower engage in a dazzling demonstration of interplay, and smoky, peat-like as well as toasted nut low-tones add depth to the wine's long, resonant, gripping, and multidimensional finish. I would plan on following this for a dozen or more years. What an amazing trio of ""Montrachet"" grand crus Girardin has rendered this year!

Vivaciously and brightly brimming with primary fruit, yet silken in texture and suffused with salinity and notes of toasted grain, this finishes with almost startling grip and tenacity. Anything it might lack in complexity today vis a vis the very best of the vintage it compensates for in sheer energy and in promise. Expect more excitement over the next 7-10 years.

2619,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The Girardin 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Combettes adds musk melon to the predictable repertoire of peach and lemon, offering an especially flatteringly creamy texture that – as with other of the best 2007s – by no means precludes vivacity or refreshment. Wafting floral perfume and underlying nut oil and malt richness contribute to the allure. But there is plenty of mineral depth here, too – suggestive inter alia of oyster liquor and shrimp shell – that sets up a dynamic interaction with the wine's abundant fruit. This finishes with a tug on the salivary glands, stomach, and imagination alike. I would anticipate close to a decade's intrigue and enjoyment, perhaps more. Girardin is keen to emphasize his being the sold proprietor with more than one parcel in Combettes, as he believes the two he owns – at the northern and southern extremes of the site – offer unique complementarity.

Particles of chalk dust seem electrically charged by all of the citric energy on display here, yet there is the textural caress of satin, and in fact an overall sense of richness generous even by vintage standards. This finishes not just long and full of floral and mineral nuance, but with that particular lift that one gets from so many of the best 2007s. I'll certainly be disappointed if this does not continue to pay dividends for a decade.

This is more soothing and refined, if less nutty or pungent, for example, than the corresponding Genevrieres, but long on saline, chalky mineral suggestions. I would anticipate this embodiment of elegance being worth following for 8-10 years.  Fortunately, there are 17 barrels of it (from acreage under contract, not estate-owned) – the opposite of a rare wine, at least by Burgundy standards!

Lemon zest and white pepper, ripe peach and chalk dust inform the nose and segue into an oily-textured yet brightly citric palate that borders on austerity. This points toward ample underlying extract, yet is not at all heavy. There are the makings of a superb wine that on another day might show more openness, but in any case demands several years in the cellar, and ought to be worth following for a decade. This is far more site-typical than most of the best 2007 Corton Charlemagne bottlings with their atypical generosity and fleetness of foot.

Girardin's 2007 musts were selectively chaptalized and finished wines here are largely in the vicinity of 13% alcohol. As usual, given the vast array of estate and negociant wines at this address (the latter status noted, where applicable, in my texts), I was not able to take time for tasting them all; in particular omitting the generics.

2627,Vincent Girardin,Meursault Les Narvaux,"Tangerine and lemon in the nose of Girardin’s 2007 Meursault Narvaux lead to a concomitantly refreshing palate tinged with chalk and the bitterness of citrus pips and toasted nuts. A sense of underlying extract and satiny richness of texture keep this from seeming spare, and the long, saline, chalky finish – which really tugs at the salivary glands – is frankly quite reminiscent of the Saint-Aubin Dents de Chien that preceded it in my tasting. Here too, I suspect a wine worthy of 6-8 years of attention. This was not only harvested late, it was also Girardin's last wine of the vintage to be bottled. 

Vincent Girardin picked until past mid-September, with most of his top sites being brought in only from the 10th; allowed skin contact he would have avoided until recent years; and beat the lees on his young wines only until Christmas, but then bottled – with a light fining, and in many instances no filtration – only in May, 2009 to maximize passive time on the lees. The regimen of new wood here (now 20-30% depending on cru) represents a drastic diminution in just the past several years, and the 2007s strike me as far more comfortable in their skins than those of 2004-2006, benefiting also from the freshness and vivacity that characterize the vintage.

2628,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet Vieilles Vignes,"The Girardin 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Vieilles Vignes – assembled from numerous parcels with vines averaging fifty years' age – smells of ripe peach, grapefruit, and lily. Brightly citric and lusciously peachy on the palate, it is underlain by a savory, saline shrimp shell-like mineral tone I often associate with Chablis, and which here contributes to the positively lip-smacking, saliva-inducing finish. This is another delicious expression of vintage virtues: vivacity and refreshment with allied to sense of richness; and forward fruit allied to a distinctively mineral dimension. I would expect it to perform well for a half dozen years.

Even brighter, tarter, and seemingly more chalk-starched than the corresponding En Remilly, this preserves a compensatory sweetness of fresh white peach and a high-toned, ""cool"" herbal accompaniment that steer it clear of austerity.

This seems to be in an awkward spot right now, although its concentration and energy are impressive and I suspect it will be worthy following for half a dozen or more years.

This energetic, athletically lean wine will probably gain richness even short-term and could use another 12-18 months in bottle, after which I suspect will be worth following for 4-5 ,though Girardin thinks much longer.

2632,Vincent Girardin,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"A 2006 Chevalier-Montrachet (of which there are four and a half barriques) offers superior subtlety and clarity in the context of Girardin’s collection. Bright citrus, peach preserves, resin and vanilla from the barrel, bitter-sweet iris, lime zest, and crushed stone all suggest themselves throughout. The combination of breadth and richness with clarity, lift, and elegance as well as understated finishing complexity offer an opportunity (for those with the requisite disposable income!) to combine sensual indulgence with wonder and intrigue. There is an ineffable but somehow chalky, stony essence in the finish here that lingers in one’s memory long after it has finally faded from the palate. 

I tasted a wide selection including all of the top crus of Vincent Girardin’s truly vast output (from nearly fifty acres of vines plus a wide range of contracts as negociant), the wines having been pre-assembled from barrel for my tasting (hence the wide point spreads).

One’s palate is suffused with citrus, talcum, and crushed stone. This is backward and a bit lacking in clarity and elegance when compared at the same stage with many of the best Corton Charlemagne bottlings of the vintage, but it is nonetheless highly impressive and promising of 8-10 years of positive bottle evolution.

Creamy, silken, and rich on the palate, it displays a knitting-together of ripe fruit with citrus, mineral, and oak inflections that most of the wines here were (as yet?) missing on the day I tasted. Partly, this is surely a matter of the impressive sheer concentration of juicy primary fruit and complex mineral character on display here. Clear, pure, and ringing in its bright citrus, this also finishes with suggestions of marzipan-, hazelnut-, orange cream- and pit fruit-filled buttered pastry, and uncanny intimations of minerality. This fine representative of a great vineyard is a candidate for at least 6-8 years bottle aging.

2635,Vincent Girardin,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"That Girardin chose to serve his 2006 Batard-Montrachet (of which he has six barrels) after a superbly refined, mysterious Chevalier-Montrachet, might be explained by the sheer power and almost gaudy richness of the former. Pineapple, baked peach and apple, vanilla, coconut, and lily flower rise voluminously from the glass. Polished, glossy, and creamy, the palate presence of this cru is expansive, palpably dense, and ultra-ripe. But in the finish, this wine amazingly manages to keep pace with the length and mineral intensity – even if not quite the intrigue – of the Chevalier, leaving behind a mound of crushed stone. This should be as long-lived as the Chevalier, if never quite as fascinating. Incidentally, Girardin purchased fruit from Le Montrachet in 2004 but did not repeat in 2005 or 2006.

Smelling like a confectionary shop, it offers a creamy, rich, opulent palate, yet manages not to be over-blown, and finishes with length, refinement, and a surprisingly low-key combination of sedate creaminess and pure, juicy citrus. While in no way dramatic, this promises to be a lovely example of its vintage and site, and one probably best enjoyed over the next half dozen years.

This first hails from lower-elevation parcels in all three communes that share this grand cru. Lemon, lime, and overt stone and chalk dominate the nose and palate here, and the sheer finishing refreshment of citrus helps ward off the hint of warmth and keep the mineral cast from rendering this impressively-concentrated wine too austere. Still, this will demand some patience, and should cellar well for at least 6-8 years.

Vincent Girardin's 1996s are generally fresher and more supple than his 1995s, but are not as concentrated or structured. Since he personally prefers softer styled wines, Girardin prefers the 1996 vintage. My feeling is that many of his 1995s will develop better over time than these delicious mid-term drinking wine.

I was absolutely blown away by the quality of Vincent Girardin's red Cote de Beaunes at my April tasting in Washington. Whereas there is always an element of doubt concerning the end product when tasting out of barrel, what I saw from Girardin was already bottled and in retail stores throughout the US (all of them were tasted with the American importer and many were later re-tasted blind with other 95 Burgundies). These are superlative red burgundies with a superb rapport in quality and price.

This estate's wines exhibit superb ripeness, outstanding balance, beautiful purity of fruit, extraordinarily well-integrated oak and tannin. In the top cuvees there is unsurpassed length. I know of no other producer/negociant in Burgundy that can deliver as broad a range of outstanding wines at such reasonable prices. Furthermore, Girardin, like Bernard Dugat in Gevrey-Chambertin, has worked hard to improve the quality of his wines. To top it all off, we can look forward to many more years of sublime wines from this estate/negociant as Girardin and his wife, Veronique, are quite young.

This is a thick, medium-to-full-bodied, powerful, highly-structured and intense wine with an exemplary depth of cassis and blackberry fruit. Rich, super-ripe, admirably well-balanced, exceptionally long, this smooth-textured gem will be at its peak between 1999-2005. I was absolutely blown away by the quality of Vincent Girardin's red Cote de Beaunes at my April tasting in Washington. Whereas there is always an element of doubt concerning the end product when tasting out of barrel, what I saw from Girardin was already bottled and in retail stores throughout the US (all of them were tasted with the American importer and many were later re-tasted blind with other 95 Burgundies). These are superlative red burgundies with a superb rapport in quality and price.

This estate's wines exhibit superb ripeness, outstanding balance, beautiful purity of fruit, extraordinarily well-integrated oak and tannin. In the top cuvees there is unsurpassed length. I know of no other producer/negociant in Burgundy that can deliver as broad a range of outstanding wines at such reasonable prices. Furthermore, Girardin, like Bernard Dugat in Gevrey-Chambertin, has worked hard to improve the quality of his wines. To top it all off, we can look forward to many more years of sublime wines from this estate/negociant as Girardin and his wife, Veronique, are quite young.

If you love Burgundian reds, run, don't walk, to your wine merchant and purchase these dazzling wines.

2874,Vincent Girardin,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"There are three outstanding examples of premier cru Puligny-Montrachet. The 1994 Puligny-Montrachet Caillerets exhibits tremendous ripeness, intensity, and purity, medium to full body, and copious quantities of rich, honeyed pineapple/pear-like notes accompanied by smoky oak and earthy scents. It is a soft, savory style of white Burgundy to drink over the next 4-5 years. Burgundy is frightfully expensive, and often disappointing, not only on a qualitative level, but in terms of the price/quality relationship. How rare it is to taste a group of Burgundies and find them to be delicious, satisfying, and, for Burgundy, reasonably priced. Vincent Girardin appears to be making the finest wines of his career, turning out full blown, smoky, oaky whites, and gorgeously seductive, round, generous red wines that are modestly priced, especially when one considers the prices now fetched by the top single vineyard/reserve Pinot Noirs from California and Oregon.

2875,Vincent Girardin,Pommard 1er Cru Les Chanlins Vieilles Vignes,"The four top red wines from Vincent Girardin include the Chassagne-Montrachet Clos de la Boudriotte Vieilles Vignes, Beaune Clos Les Vignes Franches, Volnay Les Santenots, and Pommard Les Chanlins Vieilles Vignes. All of these wines can be drunk now, but they promise to age for another 7-8 years. My favorite wine is the exquisite 1994 Pommard Les Chanlins Vieilles Vignes. More new oak comes through in this wine, but it does not dominate the white chocolate, super-rich, jammy black-cherry aromas and flavors. The wine boasts a deep ruby color, powerful, concentrated flavors, admirable purity, and a ripe, intense, chewy finish. This knock-out example of the 1994 vintage is comparable to some of the top 1990s. It should drink well for 10-15 years.

Slightly less impressive, yet still flattering is the elegant 1994 Puligny-Montrachet Les Perrieres. This delicious, ready to drink wine displays gobs of sweet, buttery, honeyed fruit, low acidity, a round, ripe, soft, succulent texture, and a clean finish.

All of these wines can be drunk now, but they promise to age for another 7-8 years. The tannic, muscular, powerful, full-bodied 1994 Volnay Les Santenots is one 1994 Girardin offering that requires cellaring. Aromas of deep, ripe fruit, and good muscle, are accompanied by a toughness that suggests 1-2 years of cellaring are essential. This wine should keep for a decade or more.

2879,Vincent Girardin,Santenay 1er Cru Les Gravières,"It is exceedingly difficult to find high quality, complex Pinot Noir, especially from Burgundy, in the $25-$40 range. Given the 1994 vintage, the odds are stacked against consumers. Many wines that possessed plenty of elegant, supple fruit and charm from barrel, were given a knock-out punch by the predilection of so many growers (and don't forget to blame the oenologists and mobile bottlers) to passively allow their wines to be nuked with high levels of sulphur, as well as excessive fining and filtration, including a sterile one if requested. Girardin's first vintage to go into the bottle unfined and unfiltered has resulted in wines of undeniable finesse, sweet fruit, charm, complexity, and elegance.
The 1994 Santenay Les Gravieres is a delicious, sexy, sweet, jammy, cherry-scented wine with plenty of ripe fruit, good glycerin, a layered mouthfeel, excellent purity, and a fine finish. There are no hard edges or obnoxious levels of acidity or tannin. It should drink well for 4-6 years.

The 1994 Chassagne-Montrachet Clos de la Boudriotte Vieilles Vignes offers gobs of cherry fruit, medium to full body, surprising richness and concentration for the 1994 vintage, and admirable muscle and power in the finish.
