1,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"If this year's regular Chevalier could be mistaken for La Cabotte in a blind tasting, so the 2022 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru might be mistaken for a Montrachet.

32,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"The 2021 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru is youthfully reticent, unwinding in the glass with aromas of dark berries, coniferous forest floor, exotic spices, smoked duck and orange zest.

This is a cuvée that always rewards a bit of bottle age.",,RP (95-97)
48,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Porrets-Saint-Georges,"One of the more reserved, reticent wines in the range is the 2021 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Porrets-Saint-Georges, a medium to full-bodied, lively red evocative of dark berries, spices, loamy soil and plums.",,RP (95-97)

Like its communal-level counterpart, it's a strong effort, though it will require some patience.",,RP (95-97)
50,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"Bursting with aromas of raspberries, sweet spices and deep soil tones, the 2021 Beaune 1er Cru du Château is medium-bodied, ample and charming, with lively acids, melting tannins and a saline finish.

53,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune Blanc,"The 2021 Beaune Blanc exhibits aromas of pear, white flowers and pastry cream, followed by a medium-bodied, tangy and saline palate that will likely pick up more texture during élevage.

56,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Lunching with a couple of friends, we compared Romanée-Saint-Vivant, Romanée-Conti, La Romanée and Aux Reignots in the 1995 vintage, ascending the Vosne-Romanée hillside. It was a fascinating exercise, and Bouchard's 1995 La Romanée Grand Cru was the one wine that didn't really play by the rules. Still deep and saturated in hue, with a rich bouquet of cassis, wild berries, woodsmoke, black truffle and loamy soil, it's full-bodied, deep and muscular, with notable concentration and extract, framed by powdery tannins and concluding with a long, lusty finish. As it sat in the glass, it calmed down and showed more elegance, the site seeming to take over. It's certainly one of the more impressive vintages of La Romanée from the Bouchard era that I've tasted, and for a long time, this must have represented a sleeper grand cru Burgundy. Of course, that time has now passed.",,RP (89-91)
57,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"The 1995 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots is showing beautifully, offering up an ethereal bouquet of red berries, wilted rose petals, sweet spices, plums and raw cocoa that presents a notable contrast to the more brooding, richer La Romanée.

58,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"From a bottle that had never been recorked or reconditioned, the 1929 Le Corton Grand Cru exhibits a preternaturally saturated hue, typical of the vintage, along with a deep bouquet of rich, plummy fruit, warm spices, woodsmoke and raw cocoa. Full-bodied, deep and elegantly muscular, it's layered and concentrated, with rich and not yet entirely melted structuring tannins, lively acids and a long, resonant finish. This will see out its 100th birthday in style!",,RP (89-91)
59,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The compelling 2020 Montrachet Grand Cru wafts from the glass with aromas of ripe pear and citrus fruit mingled with honeycomb, white flowers, fresh bread and baking spices. Full-bodied, ample and multidimensional, it's richly layered, with a textural attack that segues into an ample, fleshy mid-palate and a long, saline finish. Despite its scale, it remains beautifully precise. This is first rate.",,RP (89-91)
60,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"The 2020 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru is brilliant, bursting with aromas of orange oil, nutmeg, crisp orchard fruit, white flowers and peach.

62,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"The 2020 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru is superb, the latest in a series of remarkable iterations of this cuvée. Wafting from the glass with aromas of sweet red berries, rose hips, peonies, orange rind and warm spices, it's full-bodied, ample and layered, with terrific concentration, velvety tannins and lively acids. Deep and complete, it will be long-lived.",,RP (89-91)
63,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Grand Cru,"There are only two barrels of Bouchard's supremely elegant 2020 Chambertin Grand Cru, derived from a parcel at the southern end of this large climat, at the top of the slope, where the soils are thin and the vines are shaded from the late-afternoon and evening sun by the tree line. Offering up inviting aromas of cherries, plums, sweet spices, orange oil and forest floor, it's full-bodied, elegant and fine-boned, with a concentrated core of fruit, velvety tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, saline finish. It's a worthy follow-up to the beautiful 2019.",,RP (89-91)
64,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"The 2020 Le Corton Grand Cru is a worthy successor to the striking 2019 (which I probably underrated last year). Soaring from the glass with aromas of rose petals, orange rind, raspberries, rich soil tones and cinnamon, it's full-bodied, velvety and seamless, with a deep and layered core of fruit, vibrant acids and fine, melting tannins, concluding with a long, saline finish. This emblematic cuvée has always been a solid bottling chez Bouchard, but in the last few years it seems to have attained a whole new level of quality. When I asked Frédéric Weber what might account for this shift, he explained that he picks later and includes more whole bunches in the vinification. Whatever the reason, readers are advised to take note, as I don't think the market has yet factored in quite how good this wine is.",,RP (89-91)
65,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2020 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru opens in the glass with notes of citrus oil, musky peach, tangerine, nutmeg and buttered popcorn. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, it's chiseled  and penetrating, with a tightly wound core of fruit and a racy spine of acidity.  As readers will remember, this bottling hails from the three terraces on the hillside above Bouchard's La Cabotte, their bottling from the latter—which abuts Montrachet itself—being more muscular and powerful, whereas this cuvée is finer-boned and more ethereal.",,RP (89-91)
66,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Aromas of blackberries and plums mingling with orange rind, rose petals, peonies and exotic spices in an inviting bouquet introduce Bouchard's 2020 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru, a full-bodied, velvety and multidimensional wine that's richly layered and perfumed with supple tannins, lively acids and a long, resonant finish. This is a first-rate effort, and I can't remember tasting a better Chapelle chez Bouchard.",,RP (89-91)
67,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Taillepieds,"If the Cuvée Carnot tends to take center stage chez Bouchard, it's the 2020 Volnay 1er Cru Les Taillepieds that's the Volnay to beat to my palate this year. Exhibiting aromas of cherries, raspberries, loamy soil, black truffle and raw cocoa, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and elegantly muscular, with terrific depth and mid-palate amplitude, concluding with a long, mineral finish.",,RP (89-91)
68,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2020 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru derives exclusively from Bouchard's holdings in the upper part of the vineyard, as the lower-lying plots are being replanted. It's a high point of the range this year, unfurling in the glass with aromas of violets, wild berries, dark chocolate, plums and orange rind.

82,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Chevret,"A climat that has sometimes been blended into a generic premier cru chez Bouchard, the 2020 Volnay 1er Cru Chevret certainly merits a solo performance. Mingling aromas of sweet berries and cherries with hints of rose petals and loamy soil, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and concentrated, with lively acids, powdery tannins and a charming, elegant profile.",,RP (89-91)

95,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Rich and demonstrative, the 2019 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru wafts from the glass with aromas of orchard fruits, peach, nutmeg, orange oil and fresh bread. Full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, it's deep and concentrated, with a fleshy core of fruit, lively acids and a long, saline finish.

99,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"Revisited from bottle, the 2019 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse is performing brilliantly, bursting with aromas of sweet berry fruit, warm spices and loamy soil.

100,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc,"Tasted from bottle, the 2019 Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc has turned out very nicely, wafting from the glass with notes of crisp yellow orchard fruit, green pineapple, pastry cream, fresh bread and white flowers.

Medium to full-bodied, lively and concentrated, with powdery tannins and ripe acids, it's not especially complex, but it's aging very gracefully.",,RP 90+
103,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"A fine effort in this forgotten vintage, the 1997 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse bursts with aromas of berries, petals, orange rind, spices and dried herbs. Medium-bodied, floral and pretty, it's not immensely concentrated, but it's a charming, perfumed middleweight that's showing well today.",,RP 90+
104,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Buchard's 1986 Montrachet Grand Cru is showing very nicely, bursting with aromas of pear, mandarin, vanilla pod, dried white flowers and honey.

105,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Surprisingly, the 1986 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru was more dramatic than the Montrachet of the same year.

106,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1983 Montrachet Grand Cru had faded a little by the time I tasted it, offering up inviting aromas of apple, smoke and freshly baked bread compromised by a touch of oxidation.

108,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 1976 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus was beginning to tire a little by the time I tasted it, offering up aromas of plummy fruit, orange rind, berries and smoked duck that's fraying at the edge and a medium to full-bodied, rather stringy palate. Perhaps there are better bottles out there? Certainly, the performance of the 1976 Volnay Caillerets tasted alongside makes me inclined to think so.",,RP 90+
109,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"Rich but rustic, the 1967 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse offers up aromas of cherries, smoked meats, saddled leather and sweet spices.

110,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Totally transcending the minor vintage, the 1963 Montrachet Grand Cru wafts from the glass with aromas of acacia honey, dried orange rind, apricot, warm spices and white flowers.

112,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"The 1959 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot opens in the glass with notes of sweet berry fruit, loamy soil, smoked meats and rose petals. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and elegantly muscular, with velvety tannins and an ample core of fruit, it's in its prime today. Apparently, the bottle was even better when first opened than it was when I tasted it a few hours later.",,RP 90+
113,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"From one of the most challenging vintages of the 20th century, the 1958 Montrachet Grand Cru is better than it has any right to be! Wafting from the glass with aromas of golden orchard fruit, clear honey, candied citrus peel, toasted bread, stone fruit pits and iodine, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and elegantly muscular, with a fleshy core of fruit, lively acids and chalky structuring extract. Tasted blind, I was reaching for a better (and a younger) vintage. Burgundy, however, is a region defined by surprises.",,RP 90+
114,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Another remarkable showing for a wine from an atrocious vintage, the 1956 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with notes of honeycomb, Chartreuse, dried flowers, citrus oil and buttery pastry. Full-bodied, rich and layered, it's concentrated and muscular, with a multidimensional mid-palate and blow-average acidity. Blind, it easily passed for a much grander vintage.",,RP 90+

It's a beautifully generous Beaune that's in its prime today.",,RP 90+
116,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"One wine that I was able to identify due to its remarkably tannic, monolithic character (a signature of the vintage, whether in Burgundy or Bordeaux) was the 1926 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse. Offering up aromas of sweet plums, dark chocolate, loamy soil and spices, it's medium to full-bodied, layered and structured, with tangy acids and rich, powdery tannins that still make their presence felt on the finish almost a century after it was produced. This 1926 will see out its 100th birthday in style!",,RP 90+
117,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aromas of white flowers, fresh peach, toasted bread, mandarin oil and pastry cream introduce Bouchard's 2019 Montrachet Grand Cru, a full-bodied, layered and multidimensional wine that's deep and concentrated, with racy acids, terrific mid-palate amplitude and a long, saline finish.

119,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"Once again, for this taster, the 2019 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru is the highpoint of Bouchard's portfolio, and it will be worth a special effort to track down. Mingling scents of peonies, rose petals, wild berries and bergamot in a perfumed and quintessentially Chambolle bouquet—even if, since the upper part of the parcel is being replanted, this derives exclusively from so-called ""terres rouges""—it's medium to full-bodied, layered and perfumed, with terrific concentration, bright acids and a long, mineral finish. This isn't the most powerful wine in the range, but it's the most elegant; and it's refreshing to see Bonnes Mares interpreted in this register, rather than being extracted to the point of monstrosity.",,RP 90+
120,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Scents of dark berries, rose petals, violets and truffles introduce Bouchard's 2019 Chambertin Grand Cru, a medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated wine that's lively and tightly wound, concluding with a long, lively finish. From a parcel at the top of the slope at the southern extreme of Le Chambertin, the soils are thin and cancerous, and the resulting wine is refined, rather than massive.",,RP 90+
121,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2019 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru is destined to be much less controversial than its 2018 predecessor, as Bouchard was able to determine the date of harvest this year.

122,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières is very promising, delivering notes of citrus oil, white flowers, mandarin, fresh bread and struck match.

123,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2019 Echézeaux Grand Cru is showing especially well, bursting with scents of peonies, blood orange, wild plums, cassis and exotic spices. Medium to full-bodied, velvety and expressive, it's lively and sapid, with a pretty core of fruit, bright acids and powdery tannins. This derives from domaine holdings in En Orveaux, where Weber identifies appreciable diurnal shift as a source of freshness.",,RP 90+
124,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Offering up notes of pear, white flowers, toasted almonds and beeswax, Bouchard's 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is medium to full-bodied, satiny and chiseled, with a more tightly wound, introverted profile than the Charmes that preceded it. Built to age, this is a serious Genevrières that I look forward to tasting from bottle.",,RP 90+

Medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated, it's deep and lively, with a long, mineral finish.",,RP 90+
132,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Wafting from the glass with scents of pear, yellow apples, struck match and white flowers, the 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes is medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with fine concentration and a saline finish. This cuvée derives from holdings toward the bottom of this large climat, which appear to have overperformed in this warm, dry year.",,RP 90+

139,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons,"Bouchard owns over two hectares of this climat, and the 2019 Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons was the first parcel of Pinot Noir harvested in this vintage. Mingling aromas of sweet berries and cassis with hints of peonies, raw cocoa and loamy soil, it's medium-bodied, velvety and enveloping, with bright acids and a nicely defined finish. This is another of the portfolio's sleepers.",,RP 90+
140,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"Aromas of peonies, orange rind, wild plums, cherries and wintergreen introduce Bouchard's 2019 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières, a medium to full-bodied, supple and perfumed wine that's lively and enveloping. Routinely one of the most underrated wines in the portfolio, this is always a sumptuous yet lively wine that ages very well.",,RP 90+
141,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie 1er Cru Les Duresses,"The 2019 Monthélie 1er Cru Les Duresses opens in the glass with scents of peonies, wild berries, dark chocolate and coniferous forest floor. Medium-bodied, lively and concentrated, it's deep and velvety, with lively acids and an unusually suave, elegant texture for young Monthélie. From a late-ripening site, its racier profile distinguishes it from the more gourmand Monthélie Champs Fulliot.",,RP 90+
142,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie 1er Cru Clos des Champs Fulliot,"From an early-ripening site, the 2019 Monthélie 1er Cru Clos des Champs Fulliot delivers aromas of plums, cherries, dark chocolate and smoke, followed by a medium to full-bodied, richly layered and velvety palate that's lively and long. This is a more textural, enveloping interpretation of Monthélie when compared with the racier Duresses, but both are extremely promising in their very different stylistic registers.",,RP 90+
143,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"There are 55,000 bottles of the 2019 Beaune 1er Cru du Château, a medium to full-bodied, velvety wine evocative of cherries, smoky plums, spices and dark chocolate. Charming and perfumed, it's an elegant wine that gets my nod as the finest Beaune du Château for some time.",,RP 90+
144,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Village,"Bursting with aromas of pear, white flowers, almond paste and vanilla pod, Bouchard's 2019 Meursault Village is medium-bodied, bright and lively. It's chiseled and precise even in this ripe white Burgundy vintage.",,RP 90+
145,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie Village,"Bright and charming, the 2019 Monthélie Village bursts with aromas of cassis, cherries, sweet soil tones and potpourri. Medium-bodied, lively and perfumed, it's elegant and mineral, with a pretty core of fruit and a mouthwatering finish. This is turning out very nicely.",,RP 90+
146,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir Réserve,"Bursting with aromas of cherries, berries and licorice, the 2019 Bourgogne Pinot Noir Reserve is medium to full-bodied, layered and succulent, with a fleshy core of fruit and melting tannins. Amounting to some 500,000 bottles, the cuvée incorporates some 20% domaine-grown fruit and in its origins emphasizes the communes of Maranges and Santenay.",,RP 90+
147,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2019 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc offers up aromas of pear, white flowers and peaches, framed by a deft touch of oak.

148,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay Réserve,"There are some 450,000 bottles of Bouchard's 2019 Bourgogne Chardonnay Reserve, a cuvée that was bottled before the 2020 harvest, and it's showing nicely, delivering generous aromas of pear, peach, white flowers and orange oil, followed by a medium-bodied, round and open palate that's fleshy and lively.",,RP 90+
149,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Revisited in bottle, Bouchard's 2018 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru has turned out beautifully, mingling aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, fresh peach, citrus oil, honeycomb and buttered toast—much as it did a year ago. Full-bodied, satiny and incisive, its textural attack segues into an ample, youthfully tightly wound mid-palate girdled by racy acids and underpinned by chalky structuring extract.",,RP 90+
150,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Sumptuous and dramatic, Bouchard's 2018 Montrachet Grand Cru bursts with aromas of honeyed peaches, toasted nuts, white flowers, orange oil and fresh bread. Full-bodied, textural and enveloping, it's satiny and gourmand, with lively acids and a rich, expansive finish. If this year's Cabotte is more tightly wound and incisive, the Montrachet is irresistible for its power and scale.",,RP 95
151,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Revisited from bottle, the 2018 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is showing superbly, unfurling in the glass with inviting aromas of brioche, crisp green orchard fruit, yellow apples, citrus oil and nutmeg. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy but precise, it's charming and expressive, showing more of its cards than the 2017 rendition did at the same age, while remaining less overtly muscular than the powerful 2015. This will offer a broad drinking window, as it's already quite demonstrative. As I've written before, this bottling hails from the three terraces on the hillside above Bouchard's La Cabotte, their bottling from the latter—which adjoins Montrachet itself—being more muscular and powerful, whereas this cuvée is finer-boned and more ethereal.",,RP 95
152,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"The 2018 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot is showing beautifully from bottle, unwinding in the glass with aromas of cassis, black plums, sweet soil tones and subtle spices. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's one of the more tightly wound wines in the range, with powdery structuring tannins, lively acids and a long, penetrating finish.",,RP 95
153,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"The 2018 Le Corton Grand Cru has turned out very nicely in bottle, offering up a deep and complex bouquet of cassis, wild berries, grilled meats, black truffle, blood orange and sweet forest floor. Medium to full-bodied, deep and muscular, it's layered and concentrated, with powdery tannins, lively acids and a long, sapid finish. While this is a powerful, structured wine, it's also very refined, and this is one 2018 that will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP 95
154,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2018 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is performing very well from bottle, offering up inviting aromas of pear, green pineapple, citrus oil, white flowers, lemon curd and fresh pastry. Medium to full-bodied, deep and nicely concentrated, it's muscular and structured, with racy acids and fine reserves of dry extract. This should age with class.",,RP 95
155,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"Revisited from bottle, the 2018 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus is showing very well, unfurling in the glass with a brooding bouquet of dark berry fruit, ripe cherries, warm spices, baking chocolate and subtle soil tones. Medium to full-bodied, deep and muscular, it's rich and powerful, with ripe tannins and a voluminous core of fruit, concluding with a long, heady finish. When I tasted this wine from barrel, Bouchard's Frédéric Weber observed that analytically this 2018 is very similar indeed to the 1947 vintage of l'Enfant Jesus, and in its controlled but overt ripeness the analogy seems even more obvious from bottle.",,RP 95
156,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières is showing very nicely from bottle, offering up a youthful but already expressive bouquet of citrus oil, pear, blanched almonds, pastry cream and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, racy and incisive, it's elegantly textural, with fine concentration, tangy acids, and a precise, mineral finish. While this Perrières is already deceptively charming, if it gains in depth and complexity with bottle age as much as I suspect it will, this score may seem conservative.",,RP 95
157,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles,"Revisited from bottle, the 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles offers up aromas of cherries, plums, cassis and smoked meats that are still quite youthfully fruit-driven at this early stage. Medium to full-bodied, velvety and elegantly muscular, it's a rich but nicely balanced wine that's holding a lot in reserve.",,RP 95
158,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"More demonstrative out of the gates than the 2017 rendition, Bouchard's 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is showing well from bottle, wafting from the glass with lovely aromas of ripe Anjou pears, citrus oil, fresh pastry and peaches. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and generous, it's charming and expressive, with an ample core of fruit, succulent acids and a nicely defined finish. This will drink well young.",,RP 95
159,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"As I reported when I tasted it from barrel, Bouchard's source insisted on picking very late in this vintage, and the 2018 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru is accordingly the headiest, ripest wine in the cellar by some margin, labelled at a tariff-busting but also surely honest 15% alcohol. Offering up an extravagant bouquet of orange rind, raspberries, ripe plums, rose petals and incense that's framed by a generous application of spicy oak, it's full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with broad shoulders and a sweet core of sun-kissed fruit, built around melting tannins and concluding with noticeable alcoholic warmth. This is a challenging wine to score fairly, since its high octane style is sure to prove divisive and I suspect it won't make old bones; yet at the same time, Frédéric Weber has clearly done a fine job with the fruit he received.",,RP 95
160,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"The 2018 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières is performing nicely from bottle, offering up a rich bouquet of blackberries, smoked meats, plums, spices and violets, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and lavish, with a generous core of sun-kissed, almost opulent fruit that's framed by succulent acids and powdery tannins. This is another 2018 that bears a strong resemblance to a hypothetical blend of the 2003 and 2005 vintages.",,RP 95
161,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru,"The 2018 Pommard 1er Cru is showing nicely, wafting from the glass with aromas of dark berries, smoked meats, plums and loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with lively acids, powdery tannins and a generous core of fruit, it concludes with a savory finish.",,RP 95
162,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"The 2018 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse has turned out beautifully, delivering a generous nose of plums, wild berries, orange rind and spices.

163,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of cassis, blackberries, cherries and warm spices, Bouchard's 2018 Chambolle-Musigny Village is showing nicely from bottle. Medium to full-bodied, muscular and nicely concentrated, with rich, powdery tannins and succulent acids, it's a powerful wine that reflects the style of the vintage but which should age with grace.",,RP 95
164,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"The 2018 Gevrey-Chambertin Village is performing nicely from bottle, delivering a generous bouquet of wild plums, cherries, smoked meats and forest floor. Medium to full-bodied, muscular and nicely concentrated, with tangy acids and chalky structuring tannins, it's already rounder and more charming than it was from bottle, but it will benefit from a little bottle age.",,RP 95
165,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"Revealing attractive aromas of crisp Anjou pear, citrus oil, fresh hazelnuts and white flowers, the 2018 Meursault Les Clous is medium-bodied, chiseled and incisive, much as I wrote when I reviewed it from barrel. Delicately textural and youthfully tightly wound, this will age with grace.",,RP 95
166,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"Opening in the glass with notes of cherries, plums, spices and rose petals, the 2018 Beaune 1er Cru du Château is medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with a generous core of succulent fruit, powdery tannins and a nicely defined finish. As I wrote last year, readers may wish to think of this as a rounder version of the 2005 rendition.",,RP 95
167,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"Offering up aromas of cherries, raspberries, licorice and blackcurrants, the 2018 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village is medium to full-bodied, textural and generous, with a fleshy core of fruit, tangy acids and youthfully chalky tannins. This has turned out well, and it can be enjoyed in its boisterous youth as well as with some bottle age.",,RP 95
168,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc,"Tasted from bottle, the 2018 Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc is just as charming as it was before bottling, bursting with aromas of apricots, yellow stone fruit, honeysuckle and frangipane. Medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a generous and enveloping core of fruit, ripe but racy acids and a nicely defined, saline finish, it is already very approachable.",,RP 95
169,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"Generous and charming, the 2018 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc offers up aromas of ripe pears, fresh pastry and white flowers. Medium-bodied, fleshy and moderately concentrated, it's round and giving. This will show well young, even if it doesn't appear to possess the cut or structure for long-term improvement.",,RP 95
170,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Santenay Rouge,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of cherries, plums, smoked meats and spices, the 2018 Santenay Rouge is medium to full-bodied, youthfully chewy and tangy, distinguishing itself as one of the most rustic wines in the portfolio this year. It's a hearty red Burgundy, but it isn't long on complexity or finesse.",,RP 95
171,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Bouchard's 1990 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is at the peak of its powers today, unfurling in the glass with scents of warm pastry, yellow orchard fruit, toasted almonds, clear honey and hazelnuts. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, its bright spine of acidity is cloaked in a generous core of fruit. This is a seamless, immensely charming Chevalier.",,RP 95
172,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"Bouchard's 1959 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières is drinking beautifully, wafting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of cherry compote, ripe strawberries, warm spices and smoked tea. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, it's supple and gourmand, with a long and expansive finish. Opulent and textural, emphasizing pristinely preserved fruit over complexity, this bottle was in fine condition and I'm looking forward to the magnum I purchased from the same cellar.",,RP 95
173,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 1947 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus is showing brilliantly, soaring from the glass with a deep bouquet of ripe berries, cassis, Agen prune, black truffles, mocha, rich soil tones and licorice. Full-bodied, layered and enveloping, this is a broad and textural wine with an ample core of concentrated fruit, built around ripe acids and meltingly powdery tannins. While Frédéric Weber tells me that this attained fully 15.5% alcohol, it remains seamlessly integrated.",,RP 95
174,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"The high point of Bouchard's red portfolio this year is surely the 2018 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru, a striking wine that unfurls in the glass with aromas of raspberries, cherries and wild blueberries mingled with suggestions of rose petals, grilled squab, incense and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a multidimensional core, lively acids and a long, notably intense finish. This is a small cuvée, derived from an elongated, 25-are parcel, but it will be well worth the effort to seek out.",,RP 95
175,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Bouchard's tiny cuvée of 2018 Chambertin Grand Cru is showing very well, wafting from the glass with aromas of cassis, wild berries, plums, rose petals and rich soil tones. Hailing from a small parcel near the tree line that produces some 700 bottles in an average vintage, the wine is full-bodied, layered and elegantly structured, with powdery tannins, lively acids and a perfumed finish.",,RP 95
176,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2018 Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens reveals an incipiently complex bouquet of cherries, red berries, licorice, espresso roast and forest floor. It has a medium to full-bodied and ripe but succulent palate that's muscular and enveloping, with its generous core of fruit partially concealing a firm chassis of tannin. This, like the Pezerolles that preceded it, will demand some bottle age.",,RP 95
177,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Aromas of crisp orchard fruit, dried white flowers, blanched almonds and fresh pastry introduce the 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes, a medium to full-bodied, layered and enveloping wine that's muscular and structured, with good depth at the core and a lively, saline finish.",,RP 95
178,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Porrets-Saint-Georges,"The 2018 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Porrets-Saint-Georges lost some 50% of the potential crop to hail, but it seems to be none the worse for that, exhibiting complex aromas of red berries, dried flowers, orange rind and warm spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and inviting, with fine-grained tannins, good cut and a perfumed finish.",,RP 95

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and youthfully introverted, with tangy acids and chalky tannins that I suspect will have further resolved by the time the wine is bottled in spring 2020.",,RP 95
181,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Offering up aromas of ripe cherries, smoked meats, spices and licorice, the 2018 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru is medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with a ripe, generous core of fruit framed by melting tannins, concluding with an expansive and floral finish. This derives from the same source as the Clos de Bèze—and informed readers will easily be able to make an educated guess as to who that is—but the Chapelle has turned out better this year.",,RP 95
182,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Pézerolles,"Aromas of raspberries, plums, smoked meats and rich soil tones introduce the 2018 Pommard 1er Cru Les Pezerolles, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and muscular wine that's quite firm and concentrated, hailing from old vines.

This is a sunny, warm site that's planted with old vines, and it has turned in a fine cuvée this year.",,RP 95
184,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie 1er Cru Les Duresses,"The 2018 Monthélie 1er Cru Les Duresses is also showing very well this year, offering up a pretty bouquet of red berries, ripe Griotte cherries and potpourri.

And like the Clos Vougeot, this was hard to read in October, so a more definitive assessment will have to wait until the wine is bottled.",,RP 95
187,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2018 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru, from Bouchard's domaine holdings—and only their holdings in the upper part of the vineyard, as the lower-lying plots are being replanted—reveals aromas of raspberries, red cherries, spices and rose petals, deftly framed by new oak. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, firm and compact; indeed, the wine was quite introverted when I tasted it, so it may well have been out of sorts.",,RP 95
188,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Vosne-Romanée Village,"From a parcel that the Bouchard team farms and harvests, the 2018 Vosne-Romanée Village offers up a fragrant bouquet of raspberries, spices and rose petals, Weber observing that there is a lot of Pinot Beurrot planted among the Pinot Noir in this old-vine plot.

194,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Revisited from bottle, the 2017 Montrachet Grand Cru is showing brilliantly, exhibiting a profound bouquet of yellow orchard fruit, fresh peach, white flowers, honeycomb, freshly baked bread and wheat toast. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a textural attack that segues into a layered core that's underpinned by lively acids, concluding with a long and resonant finish. While this is already quite aromatically flamboyant, at least a decade's patience will be rewarded.",,RP 95

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with a deep and layered core, racy acids and a long, penetrating finish. While this can't quite match the mid-palate volume of the Montrachet, it certainly nods to Montrachet in style. Readers able to track down a few bottles should plan on exercising at least a decade's patience.",,RP 95
196,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"The 2017 Le Corton Grand Cru is showing very well, and I evidently underestimated it when I tasted it earlier this year. Opening in the glass with aromas of sweet berries, cloves, smoked meats and coniferous forest floor, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a textural and enveloping attack, a sapid core of fruit and a savory finish. Today, the wine's tannins are already supple and melting.",,RP 95
197,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru,"I underestimated Bouchard's 2017 Pommard 1er Cru just after bottling, and the wine has opened up in the last eight months to present quite a different picture.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and enveloping, with melting tannins, a generous core of fruit and a long, penetrating finish. In keeping with the vintage—which was characterized by long hang time but cool conditions—it's a Clos de Bèze that displays mature, even autumnal fruit tones as well as tangy acids, making for a wine that's simultaneously supple and penetrating. The finest of these cellar selections from Bouchard, this will drink well for a decade.",,RP 95

On the palate, it's medium-bodied, delicate and supple, with a pretty core of tangy fruit, powdery and largely melted tannins and a sapid, flavorful finish. This won't make old bones, but it's a charming Beaune 1er Cru from an overlooked vintage that's drinking well today.",,RP 93

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, with a fleshy core of fruit but tangy underlying acids and a precise but aromatic finish.",,RP 93
204,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Just bottled under Diam 10, the 2017 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru opens in the glass with aromas of Meyer lemon, green apple, pastry cream and white flowers that's exactly as I remember it. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and attractively vibrant, with good depth and concentration at the core, succulent acids and a long, precise finish. Pure and delicate, this is a lovely Chevalier in an understated, makeup-free style that confirms its excellent showing from barrel. While it's a little shut down after the mise en bouteille, the charm and expressiveness of the vintage mean that it is still quite open for inspection.",,RP 93
205,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"From bottle, the 2017 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru wafts from the glass with pretty aromas of cassis, cherries, black tea, rose petals and spices. On the palate,  it's full-bodied, supple and satiny, with a textural attack, a fleshy, succulent core of fruit and a pure and expansive finish. Open-knit and charming, the wine's powdery, melting tannins are largely concealed. This is a generous, head-turning Clos de Bèze that delivers immense pleasure, albeit comparatively little in the way of profundity.",,RP 93
206,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Youthfully reticent aromas of crisp Anjou pear, blanched almonds, Meyer lemon and hints of praline introduce the 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières, a medium to full-bodied, deep and tensile wine that's impressively concentrated and nicely defined. This confirms its strong showing from barrel; indeed, the wine has gained in tension since I tasted it in December. While it's a little shut down after its recent bottling, it should drink very well with a bit of bottle age.",,RP 93
207,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru surpasses its showing from barrel, revealing an attractive bouquet of ripe orchard fruit, citrus oil, spring flowers and pastry cream. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, elegantly glossy and precise, with a fleshy core of fruit that's tempered by brisk acids, concluding with a delicately chalky finish. While this is a little shut down after its recent bottling, this is a charming, expressive Corton-Charlemagne in the making.",,RP 93
208,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"The 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot is already extremely charming, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of cassis, dried rose petals, coniferous forest floor and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny, with an elegantly textural attack, a nicely concentrated core of fruit and lively acids, concluding with a precise, vibrant finish.",,RP 93
209,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus is showing well, wafting from the glass with aromas of smoky cherry and blackberry fruit that mingle with nuances of incense, spices and baking chocolate. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and supple, with a nicely concentrated core of sapid fruit, succulent acids and quite a long, harmonious finish. This has come together very nicely since I tasted it from barrel in early December.",,RP 93
210,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles,"Attractive aromas of raspberries and cherries mingling with nuances of blood orange, grilled squab and dark chocolate introduce the 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles, a wine that's showing substantially better than it did from barrel in December. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, showing good depth and dimension at the core, fine but chalky structuring tannins and good length on the finish.",,RP 93
211,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc,"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc offers up an inviting bouquet of fresh pear, yellow orchard fruit, drawn butter and freshly cut herbs. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with a fleshy core of succulent fruit and a generous, open-knit but nicely delineated profile.",,RP 93
212,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"Tasted from bottle, the 2017 Meursault Les Clous confirms its strong showing from barrel, exhibiting aromas of crisp Anjou pear, dried white flowers, beeswax and blanched almonds. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with excellent tension and depth at the core and an elegantly chalky finish. While it's a little shut down after its recent bottling, its quality is not in doubt.",,RP 93
213,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"From bottle, the 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Village confirms its strong showing from barrel, bursting with aromas of raspberries, cherries, sweet spices and dried flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and satiny, with lovely balance and depth of fruit at the core, ripe balancing acids and supple structuring tannins. This is a charming but serious Chambolle that will offer a broad drinking window.",,RP 93
214,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"Tasted from bottle, the 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse reveals a generous bouquet of smoky dark fruit, rich soil tones and baking chocolate, followed by a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and gourmand palate, framed by ripe acids and rich but melting structuring tannins. From barrel, I characterized this wine as ""open-knit and precocious,"" and that verdict holds true from bottle.",,RP 93
215,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chassagne-Montrachet Village,"The 2017 Chassagne-Montrachet Village is quite closed after its recent bottling, unfurling with a youthfully reserved bouquet of citrus zest, yellow orchard fruit and spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a delicately glossy attack, impressively racy acids and good tension at the core, concluding with a precise, mouthwatering finish. This should shine after a few years in the cellar.",,RP 93
216,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Aromas of dried white flowers, lemons, pastry cream and crisp green apple introduce the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet Village, a medium to full-bodied, elegantly satiny wine with a broad attack, good mid-palate depth and dimension and succulent balancing acids, concluding with a precise finish. This is a charming, lively Puligny that derives largely from purchased grapes.",,RP 93
217,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village is already generous and expressive, bursting with aromas of cherries, spices and flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, supple and fleshy, with a succulent core of fruit and melting tannins. Pure, fruit-driven and nicely integrated, this is already drinking well.",,RP 93
218,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Santenay Rouge,"The 2017 Santenay Rouge exhibits aromas of cherry, plum pit and raw cocoa, followed by a medium to full-bodied wine structured around fine but chalky tannins and tangy acids.",,RP 93
219,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières offers up notes of earthy red berries and herbs, followed by a medium to full-bodied, tangy palate that lacks the plenitude and concentration that distinguish Bouchard's best 2017s. From barrel, this looked to be a comparatively weak link in the range and that holds true from bottle.",,RP 93
220,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Aromas of ripe lemons, praline, crushed chalk and white flowers introduce the 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières, a medium to full-bodied, pure and chiseled wine with lovely mid-palate amplitude, a bright line of acidity and a chalky, tight-knit core. Like the Genevrières, this is one of the highlights from chez Bouchard this year.",,RP 93
221,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru hails elusively from Bouchard's holdings in the upper part of the Clos, as their lower-lying parcels are being replanted. The wine reveals notes of sweet cassis, wild berries, incense, rich soil and smoky new oak, followed by a medium to full-bodied, ample and layered palate that reveals good depth and dimension. Vinified with some 50% whole cluster, it's a very promising bottling that will likely fly under the radar.",,RP 93
222,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru is another of the highlights chez Bouchard this year, wafting from the glass with notes of wild berries, spices and licorice. On the palate, it's full-bodied, rich and lavish, with an ample core of succulent fruit and an open-knit and giving profile. It will be hard to resist in its youth.",,RP 93
223,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc displays aromas of green orchard fruit, blanched almonds and white flowers, followed by a medium-bodied, elegantly delicate palate with good concentration and a saline finish. Supple and open-knit, it will drink well in its youth.",,RP 93
224,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"Aromas of smoky cherries and cassis introduce the 2017 Beaune 1er Cru du Château, a medium to full-bodied, ample and succulent wine with a generous core of fruit that largely conceals its chewy tannins. Simple but nicely balanced, it should drink well young.",,RP 93
225,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée Village exhibits notes of sweet raspberry fruit, spices and smoky oak, followed by a medium to full-bodied palate with a juicy core of fruit, chewy tannins and appreciable amplitude and power. This hails from an old-vine parcel that Bouchard has purchased for many years and which contains an appreciable percentage of Pinot Gris—not uncommon in Vosne-Romanée.",,RP 93
226,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay Réserve,"Including some fruit from the Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais, the 2017 Bourgogne Chardonnay Reserve reveals aromas of lime blossom, sweet green orchard fruit and lemons, followed by a medium-bodied, open-knit palate, concluding with a fragrant finish. It's best enjoyed in its youth.",,RP 93
227,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2017 Echézeaux Grand Cru offers up aromas of grilled meat, ripe fruit and dark chocolate, followed by a full-bodied, ample and fleshy palate that's somewhat figgy and firm. It's seemingly somewhat overripe in profile this year, though it may just have been out of sorts when I tasted it.",,RP 93
228,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir Réserve,"The 2017 Bourgogne Pinot Noir Reserve consists largely of purchased wine that's blended by Bouchard. Offering up aromas of sweet berry fruit and cherries, it's juicy and fruit driven, framed by light structuring tannins. Drink it in its youth.",,RP 93
229,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie Village,"The 2017 Monthélie Village exhibits aromas of coniferous forest floor, raspberries and smoked meats, followed by a medium-bodied, succulent palate that's chalky but open-knit. This large cuvée—from some six hectares—will drink well in its youth.",,RP 93
230,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot is lovely, wafting from the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of wild berries, forest floor, potpourri and a subtle framing of new cedar wood. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and satiny, with beautifully powdery tannins cloaked in cool, succulent fruit, concluding with a long finish. Right now, this Caillerets is quite reserved, but its structural finesse and harmony are already impressive.",,RP 93
231,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus offers up pretty aromas of cherries, cassis, sweet loamy soil, truffles and grilled game bird. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and supple, with a succulent core of fleshy fruit and a rich and textural profile. It's a giving, generous wine that should offer a broad drinking window, but don't let its early approachability deceive, as it should be long-lived too.",,RP 93
232,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières is excellent, unfurling in the glass with notes of citrus oil, crisp Anjou pear, beeswax, wet stones and dried white flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and incisive, with an elegantly satiny attack, a tangy line of acidity and a tight-knit, concentrated core, concluding with a beautifully delineated finish. This is a racy, acid-driven Genevrières that will evolve beautifully in the cellar. Bouchard's holdings in Genevrières amount to some 15% of the appellation, so it's reassuring to see that they are in good hands.",,RP 93
233,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru unfurls in the glass with a youthfully tight-knit bouquet of crisp green orchard fruit, lemon oil, smoke and beeswax. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, delicately textural and incisive, with tangy acids, good concentration at the core and a long, precise finish. With its racy profile, this is built for the cellar.",,RP 93
234,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2016 Meursault Les Clous offers up notes of tart pear, lemon oil, blanched almonds and subtle nutmeg, followed by a medium-bodied, delicately textural palate with tangy acids and a tight-knit core, concluding with a mouthwatering finish. It's a leaner, edgier vintage for this cuvée, but it's a decided success, blossoming in the glass to take on more depth and dimension. What's more, I suspect it will really reward bottle age.",,RP 93
235,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse is showing well, unfurling in the glass with notes of cassis, cherries, sweet soil tones and licorice. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and complete, with a succulent but ripe core of fruit that cloaks its velvety structuring tannins, balanced by juicy acids. While its giving and generous profile is typical of the appellation, there is plenty held in reserve here, and at least five or six years' bottle age will be rewarded.",,RP 93
236,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, Bouchard's 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru put in a fabulous showing, making my tasting note from earlier this year seem decidedly conservative. Wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, mandarin, orange blossom, dried white flowers and toasted hazelnut, the wine is full-bodied, ample and textural, with an incredibly elegant, pure and precise profile. Above all, it's beautifully balanced, with the ineffable sense of completeness that distinguishes Montrachet at its best.",,RP 93
237,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru offers up a youthful but expressive bouquet of hazelnut, apple, preserved citrus, pear and almond paste. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, intense and racy, with a lovely line of succulent acidity, and a penetrating, chalky finish that lingers on the tongue. While this is beautifully fresh and vibrant for a 2015 white Burgundy, it's also quite structurally giving and should drink very well on release.",,RP 93
238,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru offers up a pretty bouquet of preserved lemon, citrus pith, toasted almonds and a subtle framing of new wood. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, glossy and cool, with impressive balance and a long, intense finish. This isn't quite as searingly incisive or concentrated as Bouchard's Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte, but it's an excellent wine.",,RP 93
239,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc,"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc is a very attractive wine from Bouchard Père et Fils, offering up a lovely nose of pear, melon, green fig, pastry cream and white flowers. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, fresh and vibrant, with nice chalky grip and excellent purity. A real success.",,RP 93
240,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets ""Ancienne Cuvée Carnot"" offers up a reserved bouquet of cherry, currant leaf, grilled squab and cedary new oak. On the palate, the wine is fine-grained, medium-bodied and tight at the core, with a greater sense of completeness, cohesion and depth than Bouchard's other domaine reds in the 2015 vintage. It's still lacking the concentration and depth to score higher, but the raw materials here were clearly promising. If it's merely closed, then my score will seem conservative.",,RP 93
241,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton Grand Cru opens in the glass with notes of plum, candied peel and mossy forest floor, subtly framed by spicy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, supple and quite expansive, with fine but firm tannins and an open-knit, generous core of fruit, but just a touch warm and diffuse on the finish which depresses my score.",,RP 93
242,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus is very successful in 2015, offering up a very black-fruity bouquet of crushed cassis, red cherry, caramelized orange, asphalt and cedary new oak. On the palate, the wine is concentrated, intense and full-bodied, with sappy acidity and considerable length, its fine-grained tannins asserting themselves on the firm, grippy finish. While this is currently rather primary, its raw materials are impressive and it should develop very well: tellingly, an open bottle improved over several days.",,RP 93
243,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières offers up an attractively pure nose of chamomile, citrus, pomelo and fresh pear. On the palate, the wine is chalky, medium to full-bodied and elegantly glossy on the attack, with racy acids and a sapid, penetrating finish; delicate and fine-boned in this sometimes massive vintage, and already very well-integrated. A supremely elegant Meursault Perrières.",,RP 93
244,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles is one of the highlights of Bouchard's red portfolio in 2015, offering up a complex nose of orange rind, squab, red and black fruit, strawberry and rose petal. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with creditable depth and length, structured around fine-grained but firm tannins that assert themselves on the classically Nuits finish. While more might have been possible in the 2015 vintage, this is an excellent wine.",,RP 93
245,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières reveals a pretty nose of fresh pear, herbs, macadamia nut and vanilla pod. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, glossy and fresh; quite structurally open-knit and missing some depth, but concluding with an attractively chalky finish. This should offer plenty of near-term appeal.",,RP 93
246,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2015 Meursault les Clous reveals pretty aromas of orchard fruit, flowers and pastry cream. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied but a bit diffuse and open-knit despite its lightly chalky finish. A simple Meursault adapted to near-term consumption.",,RP 93
247,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"While the 2015 vintage was generally very fine in this appellation, the 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse from Bouchard Père & Fils isn't one of the highlights of the portfolio this year, offering up a rather blurred bouquet of plums and soil. On the palate, the wine is a bit diffuse and lacking in concentration. This is a far cry from Bouchard's excellent Vigne de l'Enfant Jésus this year.",,RP 93
248,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 2000 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus from Bouchard Père & Fils is quite successful in this vintage, offering up a brooding bouquet of wood smoke, grilled venison, espresso roast, dried currant and berry fruit—marked but not dominated by toasty new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and silky, with good depth and concentration for the year and just a touch of grippy tannin clamping down on the finish.",,RP 93
249,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a detailed bouquet with attractive scents of almond and white chocolate tincturing the citrus fruit. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite cohesive and understated at first (like the Domaine Leflaive tasted earlier that day) with a sappy and convincing finish that is surfeit with minerals and a hint of tangerine. This is a very impressive, sophisticated Chevalier-Montrachet that I actually have a preference for over the La Cabotte this year.",,RP 93
250,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"There is just half of the quantity of the 2016 Montrachet Grand Cru this year (although that said, that's probably a multiple of what fellow Montrachet growers inherited). The bouquet has that marine-like tincture like the La Cabotte—oyster shell and sea cave scents underlying the citrus fruit. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, sappy in the mouth, a brooding intensity toward the finish. You can just feel the presence of this Montrachet, the opening chapter of a great wine. This will take several years to reach its apogee but it will be worth the wait.",,RP (94-96)
251,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru has much better definition and focus than the Chapelle-Chambertin at this stage: copious black and red fruit that feels more regimented and precise. The palate is well balanced with fine tannin, layers of blackberry, blueberry and a touch of burnt toast leading to a structured and symmetrical finish that bodes well for bottle age. This will rank alongside the 2015 Clos de Bèze—superb.",,RP (94-96)
252,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru comes just from the highest plot within the ancient stone-walled vineyard, as the lower plot was pulled up. It has quite a powerful bouquet with black cherries, bergamot, fresh fig and raspberry preserve aromas all well defined. The palate is very well balanced with sensual ripe tannin, good acidity, a little oak to be assimilated on the finish but otherwise a classy Clos Vougeot that will rank alongside those from more chichi, bijou names.",,RP (94-96)
253,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru has a similar bouquet to the regular Chevalier-Montrachet this year, albeit with a subtle oyster shell scent that surfaces with time. The palate is very poised and a little nuttier and more saline than the regular bottling, although for me it does not quite deliver the same precision right on the finish. It is a bit broody at the moment and maybe closer in style to the Montrachet. Three barrels produced (since the vines were less affected by frost).",,RP (94-96)
254,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières has a fresh and perfumed bouquet with scents of orange blossom and rose petals on the nose. Other vintages have displayed more mineral drive at this stage, but it is certainly pretty. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity and a sappy salinity coming through on the second half that concludes with a saliva-inducing aftertaste. Excellent.",,RP (94-96)
255,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"The 2016 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru is domaine bottled this year (whereas say, the Echézeaux, among others, is supplemented by purchased fruit). It has a gutsy bouquet with expressive raspberry, blueberry and crushed violet scents, though I found just a mote of VA that I suspect will disappear with bottle age. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy rounded opening, corpulent but well balanced with a confit-like finish. Give this three or four years in bottle before broaching.",,RP (94-96)
256,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Grand Cru comes from red clay soils that are just 80 centimeters deep before you hit the limestone bedrock. It has a finely tuned bouquet with cranberry, raspberry preserve and crushed strawberry scents, crushed roses developing with time. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, brisk and tensile from start to finish and then pulling back so as not to overdo the finish. This is a case of less is more in a wine and it is likely to surpass the 2015 Corton.",,RP (94-96)
257,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2016 Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens, located in the lieu-dit of Rugiens-Dessus, provides more focus and delineation than the Volnay Caillerets, offering plenty of detailed black cherry, raspberry and boysenberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fresh and fine tannin, crisp acidity, a little ferrous toward the finish but long in the mouth. This is very well crafted and should age well for over a decade.",,RP (94-96)
258,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos Saint-Landry Blanc, a monopole belonging to Bouchard, has an expressive yellow flower and nectarine-scented bouquet that is nicely defined. The palate is fresh on the entry with a fine bead of acidity, just a hint of edginess here thanks to the wise decision to pick this first. Brimming with tension and terroir expression, I would highly recommend this white Beaune.",,RP (94-96)
259,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"Bouchard owns four hectares of vines used for the 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières, but they were only able to eke out 32 barrels from that. What survived is great: vibrant black cherry and raspberry scents on the nose, a fresh palate with fine tannin and a really bright and lively finish almost Vosne-like in style. Such a shame there is so little of it!",,RP (94-96)
260,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Echézeaux Grand Cru does not come from the domaine this year since their own fruit was supplemented with purchased grapes. It has a pretty bouquet with vibrant red cherry and raspberry fruit laced with crushed stone and damp undergrowth scents. The palate is well defined on the entry with a gentle grip, the concentration already apparent but countered by a fine thread of acidity. The finish is just a tad straightforward but otherwise, this is a finely crafted Echézeaux, if not quite up there with the 2015.",,RP (94-96)
261,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Du Château Blanc inexplicably did not finish its malolactic until June or July. It has a tightly wound, slightly resinous bouquet. The palate is well balanced with fine tannin, crisp acidity, quite minerally in the mouth with a brisk, slightly oaky finish that lingers. What a lovely white Burgundy!",,RP (94-96)
262,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles,"The 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles has quite a plush and outgoing bouquet with hints of licorice and damson developing in the glass—just a touch of headiness here. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe black cherry and boysenberry jam notes, a little smudged on the finish where I would be seeking more tension. But I suspect this will improve once in bottle.",,RP (94-96)
263,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru has a surprisingly opulent bouquet with kirsch, red berry fruit and a touch of hoisin vying for attention. The palate is medium-bodied with firm and quite bold tannin, a little brawny toward the finish that is missing the finesse of say, the Clos Vougeot or the Echézeaux at the moment. To be honest, I found this a bit below par and a few furlongs below the Clos de Bèze.",,RP (94-96)
264,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard Village,"The 2016 Pommard Village comes from Bouchard Père's own five hectares of vines, augmented by purchased fruit. It has a fragrant and almost Volnay-like bouquet, the 15% whole cluster lending requisite freshness. The palate is nicely balanced with slightly “stringy” tannins, fresh in the mouth with a mixture of red and black fruit on the saline finish. It does not quite deliver the finish that the nose deserves but it is a commendable Pommard given the vintage.",,RP (94-96)
265,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie Village,"The 2016 Monthélie Village, which comes from Bouchard’s own six hectares of vines, has a fragrant bouquet with scents of black cherry and bergamot, just a faint hint of soy. The palate is well balanced with quite a sharp but not angular entry. This is an edgy Monthélie with fine tension and is brisk and quite structured on the finish thanks to the marl soils. Give this a year at least in bottle.",,RP (94-96)
266,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"Apparently the 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin Village was a more normal crop than the Chambolle-Musigny. It has a tightly wound bouquet that will need a couple of years to find its voice in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, crisp acidity, fine tension here if missing a little complexity right on the finish. But overall this is a very pleasurable village cru from Bouchard Père.",,RP (94-96)
267,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Du Château has a perfumed bouquet with rose petal scents filtering through the red cherry and wild strawberry scents. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, showing some tightness toward the finish and perhaps without the same flow as the Savigny-lès-Beaune Les Lavières. I would give this a couple of years for it to find its groove.",,RP (94-96)
268,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir Réserve,"The 2016 Bourgogne Pinot Noir Reserve, which had just been bottled, has a well-defined blackberry and crushed strawberry-scented bouquet, subtle tertiary scents filtering through. The palate is well balanced with a pleasant chewiness on the entry, good matière with satisfying freshness on the finish. Given the expected price, you cannot go wrong with this.",,RP (94-96)
269,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay Réserve,"The 2016 Bourgogne Chardonnay Reserve has a crisp, quite detailed bouquet with pretty yellow fruit. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, slightly waxy in texture with a touch of custard crèmes on the finish. Par for the course.",,RP (94-96)
270,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Village is a “micro-cuvée” from their own vines, augmented by purchased grapes from their neighbor. I found the aromatics a little muffled compared to say, the Monthélie, with broody dark berry fruit quite Morey-Saint-Denis in style. The palate is medium-bodied and performs better than the aromatics—fine tannin, well balanced with a pretty finish albeit missing some of Chambolle’s flamboyance.",,RP (94-96)
271,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru showed a little more ripeness on the nose compared to its peers, suggesting a slightly later picking than other growers. With aeration it gains more and more clarity, offering scents of potpourri, chalk and orange blossom. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grained tannin, the acidity well judged but very backward and clearly requiring several years to open up. Serious Clos de Bèze for those with patience, this Bouchard ranks alongside more prestigious names and I bet is not as expensive. Chapeau. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (94-96)
272,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a clean, subtle and well-defined bouquet with attractive wild strawberry, Morello and redcurrant scents. The oak here is much better integrated compared to the Clos de Vougeot from Hudelot-Noëllat. The palate is medium-bodied with fine grain tannin. I appreciate the purity here, the balance and poise, the manner in which it gently fans out on the finish. Excellent—this is another impressive showing from Bouchard Père et Fils. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (94-96)
273,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets ""Ancienne Cuvée Carnot"" has a rather conservative bouquet, earthy and missing some fruit intensity. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and attractive red cherry, cranberry and blueberry fruit. This Volnay actually improves as it goes along, and the finish conveys satisfying depth and a gentle grip, the aftertaste long and persistent. This is a strong Volnay from Bouchard Père, and it comes recommended. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (94-96)
274,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Bouchard's 2014 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru has a much more tropical-driven bouquet with scents of mango and nectarine developing in lieu of the mineralité you would expect from this vintage. The palate is well balanced with a tropical-tinged entry and well-judged acidity, but maybe a Chevalier that was picked a bit too late like that of Olivier Leflaive? It needs more mineralité and race on the finish to be up there with the best.",,RP (94-96)
275,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Bouchard's 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru was clearly showing a lot of creamy and vanilla-laced new oak on the nose that rather shaded the terroir (which when it is this vineyard, you want to sense). The palate is better with a touch of fresh ginger on the entry lending some spice, and again, there is quite a lot of oak that needs to be better enmeshed with the fruit. This finish is too sweet with a touch of brown sugar. Maybe it will improve with bottle age? It should do so given its status. But it is difficult to see the upswing at the moment.",,RP (94-96)
276,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, Bouchard's 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vignes de l'Enfant Jesus had an odd, slightly volatile bouquet that might be showing some effects of the hail. The palate is medium-bodied with dry tannin, too much wood tannins here that overwhelms the fruit and dries the finish. It just seems like a wine discombobulated by the traumatic growing season. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (94-96)
277,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Macon-Lugny Saint-Pierre,"The 2016 Macon-Lugny Saint-Pierre has a very austere and backward bouquet that feels rather anonymous. The palate is similar: balanced but missing mineralité and terroir expression on the creamy finish, peach and a touch of crème caramel on the aftertaste. So-so.",,RP (94-96)
278,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 1962 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was among some of the greatest bottles of Burgundy, Roumier, DRC and Rousseau among others, but this outstanding wine more than held its own. The purity on the bouquet was enough to take your breath away: delicate red cherries, almost understated at first, that just bloom in the glass. Fine delineation, exquisite ""Pinoté"" as fresh now as it was when first bottled. The palate is wondrous finesse and poise. The tension runs an electric mainline through this Grand Cru from start to finish, never powerful or assertive, but sensual and utterly refined. This is a compelling 1962 from Bouchard Père & Fils. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (94-96)
279,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru comes from purchased fruit, always from the same owner and parcel. It has a pleasant bouquet: cranberry, sous-bois and dried orange peel emerging with time, though I would like to see more tension come through once this is in bottle. The palate is well balanced with supple tannin, finely judged acidity and nicely integrated new oak. This actually seems to meliorate in the mouth and I particularly like the harmony on the finish. It should turn into a sophisticated red Burgundy, albeit affording it 4-6 years in bottle. Good work here.",,RP (94-96)
280,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru has a composed, citrus peel, granitic bouquet that feels a little ""cooler"" than others that I have encountered, the altitude and clay soils lending this the reserve to counterbalance the precocity of the growing season. The palate is well balanced with pleasing acidity, tightly-wound with a noticeable marine element that becomes more pronounced towards the finish. It has the weight and intensity you expect from a Corton-Charlemagne and it should repay those who cellar it for 5-7 years. This is a fine effort in such a warm vintage.",,RP (94-96)
281,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes has a focused, Granny Smith apple and wet granite-scented bouquet that maybe does not quite have the vigor of the Champs-Gains at the moment. The palate is crisp on the entry with fine focus, again, commendable salinity here with excellent precision on the persistent finish. Once the aromatics enter their stride, this should be a superb Puligny from Bouchard Père. One to watch out for.",,RP (94-96)
282,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru comes from 0.5-hectare of vine in two parcels at the top and bottom of the vineyard that are vinified together. It has a beautifully composed bouquet, a mixture of red and black fruit with rose petals and bergamot tea emerging with time in the glass. The palate is well balanced with veins of candied orange peel on the opening, the new oak (40%) needing some time to be subsumed, but lending good weight on the confit-like finish. Give it 3-4 years in bottle and it should evolve into a fine Clos Vougeot.",,RP (94-96)
283,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain has an attractive bouquet with walnut and subtle praline scents infiltrating the citrus fruit. There is certainly good intensity here. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, edgier than either of the Meursault premier crus from Bouchard and bridled with fine salinity on the slightly oaky finish that urges you back for another sip. Excellent - this is one of the picks from Bouchard Père this year.",,RP (94-96)
284,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2015 Echézeaux Grand Cru, which comes from the ""Combe d'Orveau"" lieu-dit, is usually one of the first to be picked, as the soils can suffer drought. It has a crisp, dark cherry and crushed strawberry bouquet, hints of damp moss developing, the 40% whole cluster nicely integrated and lending freshness. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, gently gripping the mouth with notes of raspberry, mulberry and sea salt. It does feel a little conservative compared to other 2015s that I have tasted, though it is undeniably proportioned and focused. I would just like more personality to be conveyed, though I wager that will develop with requisite cellaring.",,RP (94-96)
285,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges Village,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges Village, which underwent a slightly shorter extraction than normal, included 30% whole bunch fruit. It has more fruit expression compared to the Savigny-lès-Beaune Village: dark plum, blackcurrant and just a light brush of honey. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, nicely judged acidity, a little terseness towards the finish, but I feel this will improve once the final racking has been completed.",,RP (94-96)
286,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"The 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières comes four hectares owned by the estate and is matured in 30% new wood, including 20% whole cluster fruit. It has a clean and pure bouquet with bergamot-tinged red cherry and strawberry fruit that is nicely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with supple redcurrant and cranberry fruit, and well-integrated new oak, although it needs just a little more Pinoté to be expressed on the finish.",,RP (94-96)
287,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru Du Château comes from 17 different premier crus that are aged in barrel separately. It is a cuvée that debuted way back in 1907. It has an elegant bouquet that demands a little encouragement in the glass, black cherry intermixed with redcurrant, blood orange and even a smudge of marmalade. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin that lend this a masculine personality, a little hardness that should be addressed after racking, though it needs to develop more persistence on the finish. Not bad overall though.",,RP (94-96)
288,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2015 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc was picked 2 and 3 September when the skins attained a golden color, and underwent the length and intensity of pressing compared to previous vintages. I found the nose rather distant, missing a personality that can be easily defined. The palate is better with fresh peach, nectarine and dried honey notes, the acidity nicely judged with tropical hints towards the finish. If the aromatics just manifest something to say, then this will be a fine Beaune Blanc...so maybe afford it 3-4 years bottle age and hopefully it will gain more personality.",,RP (94-96)
289,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2015 Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens had to follow the superb Volnay 1er Cru Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot and perhaps as a consequence, felt a little disjointed and mean in comparison—even if there was a small reduction. There are attractive undergrowth, woodland scents permeating the black fruit, although I would have liked to see more vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, moderate depth with good grip, although I find the oak a little out of sync towards the finish. Let's see how this performs once in bottle.",,RP (94-96)
290,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin Village comes from 17 different parcels over ten hectares. It has a feisty and exuberant bouquet with touches of orange sorbet infusing the kirsch and redcurrant aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, quite masculine and firm in the mouth, but feels just a little clipped on the finish compared to the Nuits Saint-Georges, which felt more cohesive at the moment.",,RP (94-96)
291,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pouilly-Fuissé,"The 2015 Pouilly-Fuissé had been bottled just before harvest. It has a clean and crisp nose that needs more intensity and terroir expression to come through. It feels a little anonymous compared to others. The palate is crisp and saline on the entry, good acidity here with fresh green apple and pear, though again, it feels a little conservative and lacks personality on the finish.",,RP (94-96)
292,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie Village,"The 2015 Monthélie Village comes from Bouchard Père & Fils's own six hectares of vine. It has a fruit-driven raspberry and dark plum-scented bouquet with a drop of Indian ink. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly hard tannin for a Monthélie, moderate depth with a short, quite punchy blackberry and tarry finish.",,RP (94-96)
293,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir Réserve,"The 2015 Bourgogne Pinot Noir Reserve, which is a selection in the Côte d'Or appellation that is sold in the US market, has a crisp blackberry and raspberry-scented bouquet. The palate has a slight chewiness on the entry, black rather than red fruit with a gritty, masculine finish. I would just like more sweetness and flesh to develop here and reflect more of the vintage characteristic.",,RP (94-96)
294,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay Réserve,"The 2015 Bourgogne Chardonnay Reserve, a selection from the Côte d'Or, has a pleasant lime and green apple-scented bouquet that feels straightforward but possesses good intensity. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, though the finish feels rather too commercial for my liking, when I would have liked more race and tension. A weekend quaffer - there's nothing wrong with that, although competition is strong in this category of Burgundy.",,RP (94-96)
295,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"The 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village, which is matured in 30% new oak, came across as a little too woody on the nose, at the expense of terroir expression. The palate is structured on the entry with good depth and structure, however, I find the wood tannin too prominent, especially on the finish. It just needed reining in during the vinification, because there is some decent fruit here.",,RP (94-96)
296,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chevalier Montrachet la Cabotte Grand Cru has an intense bouquet with clear honey, yellow flower and subtle passion fruit notes that gradually recede and then are replaced with beeswax and honeysuckle. The palate is straightforward on the entry with fresh lime, citrus fruit and a dab of spice, although it does not quite carry through to the finish that dips before the finish line. Not bad, but it does not quite justify its strong performance from barrel, at least not yet. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (94-96)
297,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a crisp and well-defined bouquet, subtle floral scents and fine mineralité. The palate is well balanced with quite a lot of confectionary notes, quite linear though it is missing some weight towards the finish. It should not be so conservative and it needs more presence, though that might be indicative of the wine closing up for a period. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (94-96)
298,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières has a slightly muffled bouquet, the oak not quite singing from the same hymn sheet as the fruit. The palate is better with a slightly honeyed entry, the acidity nicely judged to retain balance, nutmeg infusing the citrus fruit towards the spicy and appealing finish. It just does not quite deliver the depth of its peers, but it should repay another couple of years in bottle. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (94-96)
299,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard Village,"The 1933 Pommard from Bouchard Père & Fils was a marvelous wine that just seems to break every rule in the book. Deep garnet in color, it just exudes that elusive essence of Pinoté on the nose that is clearly undiminished by the passing decades, testifying the precocity of this long lost vintage. The palate is underpinned by fine tannin, shimmering with tension and displaying wondrous tension and focus. I wonder whether any Premier Cru fruit was blended? Whatever, a simply gorgeous ancient Pommard that shall stick in the memory. Tasted December 2015.",,RP (94-96)
300,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has an enticing, subtle bouquet, timid at first but soon finding its voice and developing attractive citrus peel, yuzu and tinned apricot scents all struck through with tangible mineral tones. The palate is well balanced with impressive weight in the mouth. It never lets everything go, preferring to remain linear and maintain precision, gently fanning out towards the finish with a pinch of white pepper and vibrant citrus fruit. This is a very well-crafted Chevalier-Montrachet that is imbued with a sense of joie-de-vivre.",,RP 94
301,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières, raised in a judicious 15% new French oak, has a powerful, punchy bouquet that puts the Genevrières 2014 in the shade. This races out of the blocks with dried pineapple, citrus and stony notes, quite extravagant and whilst not delivering the same killer level of mineralité as others, it does put a smile on your face. The palate is well balanced with a keen line of acidity, just a hint of lemon zest flanked by dried apricot and grilled walnut notes. It gambols along to what feels like quite an intense finish. This is excellent...brash but excellent.",,RP 94
302,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières spent 11 months in barrel using 10% to 15% new wood. Now this is a level up from the Les Clous 2014 (as it should be) with walnut and smoke filtering through on the nose that is very ""Genevrières."" The palate is well balanced with subtle tropical fruit (guava and apricot, a hint of quince), matched by a fine line of acidity and a composed, lightly spiced finish that tingles in the mouth. This is a lovely Meurault Genevrières from Bouchard Père.",,RP 94
303,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, raised in 15% new oak like the Montrachet, has an attractive white chocolate and almond-scented nose that is pleasing, if missing a little complexity. The palate is well balanced, surprisingly austere on the entry but bestowed with impressive weight. It would benefit from more length and sustain on the finish, though it is balanced and there is a pleasing dab of lemongrass enlivening the finish. Give this a couple of years in barrel--a decent Corton-Charlemagne, even if I do prefer the Meursault Perrières!",,RP 94
304,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Côteaux Bourguignons Blanc Les Deux Loups,"The 2014 Côteaux Bourguignon Blanc ""Les Deux Loups"" is a blend of Chardonnay and Aligoté of which 90% is matured in stainless steel. It has a more convincing nose than the Bourgogne Chardonnay, the Aligoté imparting spice and slightly petrol-like notes that are attractive. The palate is fresh and vibrant from the off with a steely line of acidity, plenty of Granny Smith apples and a satisfying tension on the finish. Not the most expensive 2014 white Burgundy you will buy, but Bouchard have done an excellent job with this and it comes highly recommended.",,RP 94
305,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pouilly-Fuissé,"The 2014 Pouilly-Fuissé has a pleasant attack on the nose: citrus peel mixed with lime and a subtle granite note. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, a step up from the Bourgogne Chardonnay clearly, with a grassy, slightly herbaceous but fresh finish. Enjoy over the next 2-3 years.",,RP 94
306,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2014 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc has a distinctly earthy bouquet with dried lemon peel, smoke and subtle hazelnut aromas. It seems to gain intensity in the glass. The palate is well balanced, showing a little honey on the entry although the acidity levels remain satisfactory. It does not quite deliver the knockout punch on the finish, but there is harmony here and the dash of spice lingering on the aftertaste is appreciated.",,RP 94
307,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2014 Meursault Les Clous (Domaine), which spends nine months in French oak (10% to 15% new) has a slightly generic bouquet--delineated and fresh, and yet lacking the personality I am looking for in a village cru level. The palate is fresh on the entry with lime and green apple notes, just a touch of salinity towards the finish, but never really putting its head above the parapet in this great white Burgundy vintage. The word that springs to mind is... ""standard.""",,RP 94
308,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay La Vignée,"The 2014 Bourgogne Chardonnay La Vignée, which spent eight months in barrel with 10% new wood, has a light but crisp, grass clipping-scented bouquet. The palate is simple with satisfactory weight in the mouth and I detected a slight creaminess towards the easy-drinking finish. Fine, but par for the course.",,RP 94
309,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"The 2014 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village has a slightly smudged bouquet, perhaps the 20% to 30% new oak a little excessive vis-à-vis the fruit concentraiton. The palate is soft and rounded, quite approachable, but the finish feels labored and does not flow as it should.",,RP 94
310,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir La Vignée,"The 2014 Bourgogne Pinor Noir La Vignée, 85% matured in stainless steel, has a simple, easy-going, clean Morello cherry, strawberry and vanilla-scented bouquet. The palate is chunky and a bit rustic, as well as easy-drinking, but to be honest it needs more complexity even at generic level. Not bad, but it could have been better.",,RP 94
311,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie Village,"The 2014 Monthélie Village is certainly better than the Côtes de Beaune with fresh raspberry and strawberry preserve on the nose, nonchalant as you expect a young Monthélie to be. The palate is medium-bodied with chunky tannin, a bit hard towards the finish that cuts away abruptly. Drink over the next couple of years.",,RP 94
312,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Côteaux Bourguignons Rouge Les Deux Loups,"The 2014 Côteaux Bourguignons Rouge ""Les Deux Loups"" had rather withdrawn, broody nose that does not have the innocent joie-de-vivre of the Bourgogne Pinot Noir. The palate is soft on the entry with red cherry and strawberry notes, but is seems a little fatigued towards the finish and therefore I would drink this over the next 12 months.",,RP 94
313,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Côte de Beaune-Villages,"The 2014 Côtes de Beaune Villages has an herbaceous nose that is calling out for more fruit. The palate is rustic and chewy, too simple and rather hard towards the finish. Apparently this was matured in 20% to 30% new barrels and it seems too much because it dries out the finish.",,RP 94
314,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 1971 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru from Bouchard Père was mature in color. The nose reflects the propitious nature of both vintage and vineyard: well defined with tart cherries, strawberry, orange rind and vine tomato, gaining intensity in the glass. The palate displays wonderful balance. It is not a powerful Grands Echézeaux, but it has a fine line of acidity, great poise and structure all the way to its Rhône-like, animally finish. This is delightful and continues to give pleasure. Tasted November 2015.",,RP 94
315,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Richebourg Grand Cru,"This is the second time that I have encountered the 1971 Richebourg Grand Cru from Bouchard Père & Fils and this is perhaps a better bottle. It is remarkably deep in colur, perhaps worryingly so, but rest assured that the aromatics deliver plenty of freshness and delineation with scents of mulberry, tar and almost peat-like aromas. The palate is structured with fine acidity, a subtle spicy undercurrent, perhaps a little rustic...but the bottom line is that this is a pleasure to drink. After lambasting many of the La Romanée wines made by Bouchard during this period, it is nice to complement a fine Richebourg that after 44 years continues to give pleasure.",,RP 94
316,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chevalier Montrachet la Cabotte Grand Cru from Bouchard Père & Fils has a slightly more exotic bouquet within this flight with touches of white chocolate and almond originating from the more generous and conspicuous use of new oak. It needs time to fully integrated. The palate is concentrated and lightly honeyed, the acidity nicely judged but there is a nagging feeling that it was picked a little too late, reminiscent of some of those 2006s on the finish that is missing some delineation. Returning to the glass it actually becomes more refined and elegant, with a saline tang on the finish. This must represent one of Bouchard's finest contributions to the vintage.",,RP 94
317,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru from Bouchard Père & Fils was one of the few that surpassed my expectations out of barrel. It has abundant red berry fruit on the nose - wild strawberry and blackcurrant, a touch of fennel coming through with aeration. There is oak here, but it is nicely enmeshed. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannins. There is plenty of sweetness here, candied orange peel infusing the bright, tart cherry fruit, but maintaining fine precision on the finish.",,RP 94
318,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. Maybe I underestimated the 2012 Volnay 1er Cru Caillerets Ancienne Cuvee Carnot from Bouchard Père & Fils? Certainly seems so, judging by this gorgeous example. Here, it has a conservative and tightly-controlled bouquet with a touch of soy mixed in with the red berry fruit that does not quite deliver the harmony and poise of its peers. The palate is medium-bodied and bitter on the entry. There is plenty of sour cherry and juniper berry here, edgy and tensile, while the finish is focused and building on that tension to offer great drinkability. On its own like this, it feels severe, but I can imagine it complementing a dinner with great style.",,RP 94
319,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru from Bouchard Père has a well defined bouquet, the oak present but more integrated than Sylvain Loichet’s: subtle with hints of white flowers and minerals developing with aeration. The palate is balanced and poised, the acidity well judged and combines well with the viscosity. It comes across as quite an understated and feminine Corton-Charlemagne that I was hoping would improve in the glass, but instead, it seems to lose some of its initial promise.",,RP 94
320,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves Vignes de l'Enfant Jesus has a crisp, tensile bouquet that seems to show more freshness and vitality than its peers. There are bright red cherries mixed with damson and citrus fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and well judged acidity. The oak is well integrated and there is plenty of freshness and tension on the finish. This is one of the best Beaune Grèves of the vintage.",,RP 94
321,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru from Bouchard Père et Fils has an earthy, rather subdued nose that lacks the complexity and the energy displayed by Rousseau's Clos-de-Bèze 2012. There is something a little dour here. The palate is reduced on the entry although there seems to be decent substance underneath. Chewy and rustic, this needs to nurture more finesse and precision, though it would not surprise me if time smooths out the edges. Dumb phase? Quite possibly.",,RP 94
322,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières from Bouchard Père & Fils has an attractive nose: honeysuckle and jasmine at first, orange blossom following soon after. This is very well defined and poised. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry. There is appreciable mineralité here with a harmonious finish that has the nervous nature of a Meursault Perrières. Not quite as promising as previous bottles I have tasted, but still a worthy Meursault from Bouchard Père.",,RP 94
323,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2005 La Romanée Grand Cru from Bouchard Père & Fils does not have the refinement and delineation of the 2006, more forward but not as nuanced. The palate is medium-bodied, quite rounded and supple with good weight in the mouth, but it must be said that compared to the Liger-Belair bottling there is clearly not the same complexity and tension, you could almost say more commercial. That might appeal to some people, but perhaps that should not be the case at this level and price point. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
324,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2004 La Romanée Grand Cru bottled by Bouchard Père & Fils has a strange nose. It does not display the vegetal scents like the Liger-Belair bottling, but it feels muffled and rather fungal. The palate is medium-bodied with a grainy, slightly acetic opening. It gains a little harmony toward the finish with fine definition, but there is a dourness and austerity that it cannot quite shake off. I would not leave this for a long time in the cellar. It actually declines in the glass and feels rasping and hot. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
325,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2003 La Romanée Grand Cru bottled by Bouchard Père & Fils has a bright ruby colour. The bouquet is attractive for such a warm vintage having retained plenty of freshness. Mulberry mixed with leather and later blackcurrant pastille that are nicely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded, quite soft tannin, but there is a grittiness and slight dryness that surfaces toward the second half. It is a commendable expression on the finish and the spicy, black pepper finish is enticing, but I maintain that the mineralité and tension was erased by the heat of that summer. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
326,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2002 La Romanée Grand Cru bottled by Bouchard Père & Fils has candied red fruit on the nose, touches of blood orange and mandarin developing with time, all nicely defined. It become ever more fragrant in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly leafy red berry fruit. The tannins are not as fine as the best 2002 Côte de Nuits although there is a pleasing, almost fiery finish. It just misses the class and sophistication I was hoping for and it feels a little short. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
327,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2001 La Romanée Grand Cru, which is a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling and was picked on September 21, was represented by a late release bottle from 2014. It has a rather one-dimensional nose that unfolds in the glass, offering light raspberry and cranberry scents, though never quite achieving grand cru quality. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy ripe tannins, a little saline in the mouth, spicy and forthright with a gentle grip toward the finish. There is piquant red cherry fruit that gives it a tartness that does not quite sit well. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
328,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 2000 La Romanée Grand Cru was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottlings and came from Louis-Michel's own cellar. It was picked on September 16, according to the estate's records. It has a glossy bouquet with quite a lot of oak submerging what appears to be some attractive red fruit underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, moderate acidity, a little dryness developing toward the finish with white pepper and leathery notes. There is decent depth here, but like the 1998 it is missing charm and nuance. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
329,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1999 La Romanée Grand Cru from Bouchard Père et Fils is another vintage that should be much better. The aromatics do not possess the requisite freshness on the nose with light blackberry leaf and cranberry scents that just feel a bit dull. The palate is medium-bodid with supple tannin, but there is a jarring bitterness that knocks it off balance, plus a dryness on the finish that suggests that it has seen better days. It just cannot unshackle itself from ordinariness. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
330,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1998 La Romanée Grand Cru was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling that came directly from their cellars for this tasting. It was picked on September 23. It has a dark cherry and mulberry-scented bouquet with equal fruité as the 1997, but without the same delineation or personality. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, but the problem here is that the oak seems a little dominant and shaves away the complexity on the finish. It has the substance to last another 15 to 20 years, though it is lacking charm. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
331,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1997 La Romanée Grand Cru, a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling that came from Louis-Michel's own cellar, was picked on September 22. It has one of the more attractive noses from this era, not dissimilar to the 1995, whereby the fruit seems less worked. There are lively red berry fruit, blood orange and Clementine, fine delineation and lift. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, ripe and slightly savory red fruit with a touch of gaminess coming through on the finish. This is still offering pleasure and offers grand cru class, even if I would not leave it in my cellar for a long period of time. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
332,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1994 La Romanée Grand Cru was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling that came directly from Louis-Michel's cellar. Picked on September 24, it has a strong eucalyptus-scented nose that is more Australian than Burgundy! The palate just feels totally ersatz, possibly heavily chaptalized with brown sugar sweetening up what is actually a dry and austere, mean finish. This is well below par...a double bogey? Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
333,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1993 La Romanée Grand Cru was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling. It is deeper in colour than the 1995, though the nose is less attractive: brambly red berry fruit, stewed black tea and a touch of mandarin. But it feels a little curmudgeonly and does not possess the joie-de-vivre of the best 1993s. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, good depth of fruit, sinewy tannin wrapped around a ""blocky"" and slight saline finish. It is an enjoyable wine that has lasted the course but it lacks grand cru class. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
334,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1992 La Romanée Grand Cru, which was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling, has a rather limp, red cherry and dried blood nose that is missing a little energy. The palate is medium-bodied with dry tannin, bitter cherry fruit and a tapered, rather hard finish that feels brutish and forced. There is a touch of TCA here but even so, I doubt this was ever much kop. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
335,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1991 La Romanée Grand Cru was a Bouchard Père et Fils bottling and was purchased directly from the domaine. It has a simple bouquet with a light marine influence, but it feels a little ""pushed."" The palate is medium-bodied with simple red and black fruit, but it lacks energy and feels static in the mouth. You would drink a glass, but it lacks real breeding and class. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
336,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1985 La Romanée Grand Cru from Bouchard Père et Fils ought to have been one of the modern day highlights. It's not a bad Burgundy but does not reach Grand Cru quality. Mature in colour, the aromatics are more fungal than previous bottles with scents of tomato vine and decayed red fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with a drop of soy on the entry, slightly ferrous but lacking weight and richness toward the linear finish. It's acceptable until you realize what could have been. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
337,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1984 La Romanée, which was labeled under Bouchard Père et Fils, is mature in color with a wide tawny rim. The nose is rather dusty at first, tertiary and leather and clearly denuded of fruité by the passing years. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannin, tart cherry fruit, not undrinkable, but showing some rawness and attenuation on the finish. It is actually respectable for a 1984 Burgundy, but it should be consumed in the next 4-6 years with low expectations. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
338,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1983 La Romanée Grand Cru, which was under the Bouchard Père et Fils label, with significant bricking on the rim. However, there is much to admire on the quite lively and precocious bouquet with stewed oranges, Clementine, red plum and a pinch of sage and rosemary. It is nicely defined with leathery tones developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannins and nicely judged acidity. It is harmonious in the mouth, silky smooth with decent depth. It gently grips on the finish with just a touch of red pepper on the aftertaste. This performs well above expectations. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
339,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1982 La Romanée Grand Cru was tasted from magnum and labeled ""Bouchard Père et Fils"". It has a similar bouquet to the 1981, albeit with a little more precision, though nothing compared to the finest vintages. There is a savory tincture, dried blood element that develops with time, almost Pomerol-like in style. The palate is medium-bodied with gritty tannins, although there are not dry. Like other coeval vintages, there is a Médoc-like personality here, perhaps missing the class of the greatest era, but certainly with pleasure to give. Just don't expect sheer class. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
340,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1980 La Romanée Grand Cru, sporting a Bouchard Père et Fils label, had been acquired directly from Bouchard's cellars. It has a clear, lucid colour with less bricking on the rim compared to the previous vintage. The palate is clean and pure with mulberry, black truffle and pastille scents. It is nowhere near the quality of say, the La Tâche 1980, although it is cut from the same elegant cloth. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin. There is good acidity here and fine balance, missing some complexity toward the finish. Yet it is still offering pleasure, though feels a little broad-shouldered and lacking grand cru class. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
341,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1979 La Romanée Grand Cru, which was labeled Bouchard Père et Fils, had been purchased from the north of France by Louis-Michel Liger-Belair. It has a good deep color with modest bricking on the rim. The nose is malodorous: raw and vegetal, dirty compared to other vintages. The palate is poleaxed by piercing acidity and volatility, dry and mean on the finish. This is poor and ought to be much better. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
342,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1978 La Romanée Grand Cru, bottled by Bouchard Père et Fils and coming straight from the cellar the morning of the tasting, has a light, fully mature nose with maraschino cherry and brown sugar scents. The warmth of the vintage comes through and it gains cohesion with aeration. The palate is fully mature, perhaps a little rustic with noticeable acidity and some volatility emerging toward an attenuated finish. It is not a bad 1978, though like many around this era, it regrettably falls far short of what could have been achieved. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
343,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair. The 1976 La Romanée Grand Cru, which was bottled by Bouchard Père & Fils, is commensurate with other recent 1976s that I have tasted. It has a clean and pure bouquet, perhaps a little meaty with a touch of Moroccan spice. The palate is medium-bodied with a structured opening, the fruit slightly darker than I was expecting, rustic black fruit mixed with cola. It feels a touch truncated on the finish that veers a little towards Bordeaux in terms of tannin profile. As a 1976 it is a commendable wine but not in the same class as the best from say, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
344,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Romanée vertical at Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair, the 1865 La Romanée had been whisked away from the cellars of Bouchard the very morning of the tasting and transported to Vosne-Romanée. It has a surprisingly deep colour, healthy and clear. It is not quite as fresh as the likes of the 1908 or 1911 tasted alongside, with cold tea (Earl Grey) and tertiary notes. It is medium-bodied, a bit rustic and conservative, hints of ginger and brown spices, dry and masculine toward the finish though with sufficient vestiges of fruit after 150 years to ensure you finish the glass, thus fulfilling its raison d'être. Returning after several minutes I noticed a little rooibos developing on the finish. It is a delightful wine from the pages of history, if not quite the transcendental experience you might have predicted. Tasted June 2015.",,RP 94
345,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at Farr Vintners Kumeu/White Burgundy tasting. The 2009 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières from Bouchard has a delightful bouquet with strong floral scents, hints of white peach and lemongrass developing with aeration alongside a light cockleshell influence. The palate is medium-bodied and leesy in the mouth. It does not quite have the natural mineralité of the 2009 Matés Vineyard Chardonnay tasted alongside, though there is appreciable weight and concentration on the finish, if not the finesse. Nevertheless, this remains a commendable, well-crafted Meursault Perrières, a vineyard that has long been one of Bouchard's strongest offerings.",,RP 94
346,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"The 1985 La Romanee from Bouchard Pere & Fils is very refined on the nose, nicely delineated, if not as powerful as you might expect. It offers bright red cherry, soy and oyster shell, touches of autumn leaves that give away its age. The palate is balanced and poised, although it is not the most complex 1985 I have encountered recently. Where it falls down just a little is on the finish that feels a little static compared to its peers and, considering the illustriousness of this grand cru, you would have expected more. ",,RP 94
347,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a crisp, limestone, mint-scented bouquet that is very nuanced, but gains intensity all the time in the glass. The palate is very well balanced with a taut line of acidity, hints of white peach and orange zest developing toward the tender but long finish that reveals its mineral core with each swirl. This is a classy Chevalier-Montrachet from Bouchard Père.",,RP 94
348,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2013 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Combettes has a more nuanced bouquet than the Champs-Gain with more wet stone, almost gravelly scents emerging with encouragement. The palate is crisp and taut with a twist of sour lemon, a dash of spice and a commendably long finish. This is a superb Puligny Combettes from Bouchard Père: in some ways their most impressive contribution to the 2013 vintage.",,RP 94
349,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières has an attractive austerity on the nose, well defined, and actually capturing the essence of Perrières better than some of the more famous producers. The palate is crisp and precise with a keen line of acidity, well-integrated oak and a touch of grilled walnut and salinity toward the long finish. Bravo! This is very well-executed Perrières.",,RP 94
350,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Le Montrachet Grand Cru has a very reserved bouquet, a light marine influence coming through with aeration of shucked oyster shells and a smidgen of orange rind. The palate is fresh and crisp, compact, more austere than the two Chevaliers at the moment, with very laconic, tight-lipped finish compared to others that I have tasted. Let’s see...this is giving away zilch at the moment!",,RP (91-93)
351,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Champs-Gain has a reserved, mineral-driven, well-defined bouquet that opens nicely with aeration. The palate is well balanced with citrus lemon, crabapple and fresh pear that segues into a focused, saline finish with hints of praline on the aftertaste. This is a well-crafted Puligny from the team.",,RP (91-93)
352,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Les Gouttes d'Or,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Gouttes d’Or has a relatively exotic, quite precocious bouquet with mango, orange sorbet and pronounced peachy notes. The palate is rounded and citrus-fresh on the entry with candied orange peel and peach, less in the way of mineralité, but it has a brightness on the finish that is appealing.",,RP (91-93)
353,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru, which is matured in 50% new oak, has a tightly wound but nicely defined, very focused bouquet that has fine underlying minerality. The palate is well defined with fine tannins, hints of vanilla and dark chocolate infusing the red berry fruit with quite a commercial, but undeniably sensual, finish. This should give much pleasure over the next 10-15 years.",,RP (91-93)
354,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Cailles,"The 2013 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Cailles comes from a single hectare of vine on deep soil with small stones and tends to mature late. Including 40% whole-bunch fruit, it has an appealing and exuberant bouquet with lifted dark cherries and blueberry aromas – somewhat “playful” perhaps. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe tannins, quite concentrated, but maintaining respectable delineation on the linear finish. Fine.",,RP (91-93)
355,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"From the domaine's small 0.24-hectare parcel, the 2013 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru is ripe and pretty, if slightly monochromatic, with a blueberry-scented bouquet that needs a little more energy and animation. The palate is medium-bodied with a confit entry, black cherries intermingling with raisin and fresh prune, with decent definition toward the finish. This feels candied but lacking authority.",,RP (91-93)
356,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"The 2013 Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc, which sees around 10% new oak, has an appealing, perhaps commercially savy peach-scented bouquet that opens nicely with aeration. The palate is balanced with good weight, harmonious and lightly spiced at the moment and adorned with an attractive twist of sour lemon on the finish. This Beaune is quite refined and is well worth seeking out.",,RP (91-93)
357,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru has a ripe, candied bouquet with macerated black cherries mixed with raisin and orange peel, perhaps a little commercial compared to its peers, but nicely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins and good tension. This is fresh and focused, although at the moment it is missing some persistence on the finish.",,RP (91-93)
358,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"The 2013 Beaune Greves Vignes de l’Enfant Jesus, a four-hectare monopole, was showing just a touch of reduction but there is satisfactory delineation on the nose with lifted blackberry and raspberry coulis scents nicely integrated with the oak. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with a keen line of acidity, exerting an insistent grip on the lightly spiced, soy-tinged finish that lends it a sense of masculinity. A case of nobility falling short.",,RP (91-93)
359,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has a noticeable licorice ""allsorts” nose, a little too obvious for my liking. The palate is ripe on the entry with honeyed fruit, well-judged acidity and quite a harmonious honeyed finish that maintains admirable definition. I much prefer the palate to the aromatics at the moment, but maybe it will improve by the time of bottling.",,RP (91-93)
360,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2013 Pommard 1er Cru les Rugiens has quite a lively, vivacious bouquet compared to the Volnay Caillerets at the moment: nicely defined with good minerality. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, succulent tannins, plenty of cranberry and blackberry fruit with a rustic, spicy, chewy finish that lacks a little persistence. Otherwise this will be fine once it is in bottle.",,RP (91-93)
361,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton Grand Cru, which sees around 50% new oak and had been racked in September, has a touch of sur-maturité on the nose – wisps of fresh prune infusing the black fruit. The palate is sweet and confit with ripe tannins, compact at the moment, but the new oak imposes too much toward the finish. Shame, because otherwise this could have been a Corton with finesse. Perhaps it will resolve that with time? We will see.",,RP (91-93)
362,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots, of which there is 40% new oak, has a bashful nose at first, but it opens with some aeration: blackberry and small dark cherries, a touch of minerality coming through. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannins. This is masculine for a Suchots and it is missing the opulence and flamboyance one usually finds in this vineyard. This is a bit too serious for its own good.",,RP (91-93)
363,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2013 Meursault les Clous has an attractive minty bouquet with touches of citrus lemon and apricot blossom. The palate is medium-bodied with a keen line of acidity. It is not complex, but at least fresh with decent length. This is a satisfactory if commercial Meursault.",,RP (91-93)
364,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pouilly-Fuissé,"The 2013 Pouilly-Fuissé has a pleasant honeysuckle and hazelnut-tinged bouquet that is a level up from the generic white Burgundy from Bouchard. The palate is nicely balanced, the 10% oak barrel nicely integrated and lending body toward the simple, easy-drinking finish. Fine.",,RP (91-93)
365,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"The 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin was missing fruit intensity on the nose and consequently feels a little anonymous. The palate is better, with more presence than the aromatics, grippy black fruit tinged with marmalade, but it just lacks finesse on the finish. There are superior Gevrey Village to this in 2013.",,RP (91-93)
366,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"The 2013 Beaune du Château, raised in 35 to 40% new oak, has a nicely controlled bouquet with dark, slightly earthy fruit. The palate is quite tannic on the entry with dark berry fruit, uncomplicated and a little rustic, but at least there is some freshness toward the conservative finish. Unexciting perhaps, but you might still finish the bottle.",,RP (91-93)
367,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie 1er Cru Les Duresses,"The 2013 Monthelie 1er Cru les Duresses seemed a little “forced” on the nose, with incongruous prune notes infusing the red fruits. The palate is ripe on the entry with a thick layer of creamy oak (30-35% new) that is pleasant but it detracts from the terroir expression on the cola-tinged finish. It just feels a little ersatz at the moment.",,RP (91-93)
368,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Pinot Noir Réserve,"The 2013 Bourgogne Pinot Noir Reserve has a rather anonymous bouquet at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannins, but there is insufficient fruit and flesh on the finish.",,RP (91-93)
369,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bourgogne Chardonnay Réserve,"The 2013 Bourgogne Chardonnay Reserve has a simple, clean, but slightly dull nose. The palate has decent body but there is little complexity or nuance on the finish. Nothing offensive here – just drink over the next year.",,RP (91-93)
370,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"The 2013 Savigny-les-Beaune has a light cranberry and briary bouquet. It is medium-bodied with chewy tannins, quite rustic in the mouth, and I feel the 25% new oak is a tad too much on the attenuated finish. This is a weak showing.",,RP (91-93)
371,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chambertin Clos de Bèze 2011 from Bouchard seems more introspective on the nose: cranberry, wild strawberry, a hint of tomato vine and woodland aromas. It takes some coaxing from the glass, eventually offering hints of Seville orange. The palate is full-bodied and dense. There is a lot of fruit intensity here with bold tannins and good depth, but unlike the Clos-de-Bèze from Rousseau it does not own the same level of precision and comes across a little aggressive by comparison. Still, time mellows us all.",,RP (91-93)
372,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Beaune 1er Cru Grèves from Bouchard Père has an open and generous bouquet that is far more inviting than the other Beaune Grèves in this group. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp and quite succulent tannins, well-judged acidity and a bright, vibrant finish that has a citrus-like intensity. Long in the mouth, this is a well-crafted and quite delicious Pinot that shows off the propitious nature of its terroir.",,RP (91-93)
373,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte 2011 from Bouchard Père has a foursquare, quite austere bouquet with good intensity and definition. This has much more focus than the first two wines. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a slight grassiness on the entry. But the acidity is very fresh here, lending tension and poise to this Chevalier-Montrachet. My only quibble is that it is missing some nobility at the moment – perhaps that will develop with time.",,RP (91-93)
374,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens has quite a complex bouquet with fine, edgy brambly red fruit: a hint of juniper berries and quince. It coalesces nicely in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with svelte tannins, supple texture and a harmonious, assured finish with plenty of juicy red berry fruit laced with white pepper and bay leaf. There is certainly a lot going on in this wine and it should evolve nicely over the next decade.",,RP (91-93)
375,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Clos de Vougeot from Bouchard Père has an open and generous bouquet with sous-bois-tinged red fruit that are vivacious and offer enticing “pinoté."" The palate is well balanced with fine acidity and delineation, hints of strawberry cheesecake and raspberry leading to a relatively spicy finish that has good length. Coming back a second time, this does dispense some of its initial vigor and weight, so I would suggest drinking this Clos de Vougeot over the next 4-5 years and not longer.",,RP (91-93)
376,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières 2011 from Bouchard Père & Fils has a well-defined bouquet with subtle notes of lemon thyme and chalk, that gradually unfold and gain vigor in the glass. The palate does not quite match the promise of the nose and just seems too loose-knit, too generous and too keen to please.

377,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 2011 from Bouchard Père & Fils has quite an austere bouquet that is missing some fruit concentration, some pyrazine and reductive notes developing in the glass. The palate is taut and grassy on the entry, again with some pyrazine notes coming through and rendering this a little facile and hard. This is disappointing in the context of both vineyard and other wines from this Burgundy stalwart.",,RP (91-93)
378,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Volnay 1er Cru Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot has a slightly smudged bouquet. It feels a little reduced with dusky, brambly, dark berry fruits that are sullen. The palate is smudged on the entry with chewy tannins and moderate acidity, but it is lacking a little finesse and detail.",,RP (91-93)
379,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2005 Le Montrachet from Bouchard Pere & Fils is drinking absolutely beautifully at present. The nose is actually quite reticent at first, but its delineation cannot be denied and it gathers momentum with aeration, revealing its hidden mineralité. The palate is very focused and poised, the acidity totally synched with the mineral-drenched fruit. It moves toward a succinct almond and custard-creme finish that avoids any blowsiness. Some look down upon Montrachet from Bouchard - that is their loss - because this is a fantastic example of a grand cru that does not necessarily always deliver.",,RP (91-93)
380,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The 2002 Chambertin Clos de Beze from Bouchard has a slightly meaty, almost hickory-tinged bouquet that suggests just a touch of brettanomyces here. The palate is medium-bodied with moderate complexity, a little lighter than its peers with an austere and reserved finish that never quite delivers that knockout punch. This is a little too conservative for its own good.",,RP (91-93)
381,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Grand Cru,"For a ’76, Bouchard’s Chambertin is quite deep in color. It still possesses and open, quite vibrant bouquet with sloe, red cherries, balsamic and dried herbs – all quite harmonious. The palate is quite sweet on the entry, translating the heat of that summer, but at the same time that heat has tended to “flatten” this Chambertin and the pastille-finish feels a little monotonous. This is a respectable grand cru for its age and vintage, but is not a thrill a minute.",,RP (91-93)
382,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Montrachet Grand Cru has an introverted, stony bouquet that unlike the Chevalier Cabotte demands some coaxing from the glass. There are subtle notes of pear drop and apricot blossom that surface with time. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with touches of blackberry leaf. This is very focused and long in the mouth, although perhaps I prefer the La Cabotte this year. Drink 2016-2030+

The palate is medium-bodied, the one-third new oak nicely integrated, with a chewy blackcurrant pastille and white pepper finish that feels long in the mouth.

It has a very fragrant, very intense bouquet with black cherries, cassis and violets. The palate has a very supple entry with a fine line of acidity. It feels so juicy in the mouth, although that belies the fine tannins that underpin the finish. This is one of the best reds from Bouchard this year.

The vines here are planted north to south rather than the orthodox east to west. It has very good definition on the nose with scents of mulberry and marmalade, floral scents emerging later. The palate is medium-bodied, lively and vigorous, hints of orange zest and marmalade once again infusing the red berry fruit. The tannins are fine and lithe with good delineation on the vibrant finish. This is very fine.

406,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"The Bouchard domaine 2008 Clos Vougeot Domaine Bouchard – from one parcel high-up in the Plante de l’Abbaye, and another low but against the wall of the clos – smells of cedar, licorice, blond tobacco, sandalwood, dark cherry, and black raspberry. Rich and sapid in fruit; deeply, cleanly meaty; savory and invigorating in its salinity and its recapitulation of themes sounded in the nose, this has surprisingly much in common with the virtues of the corresponding non-estate-bottled Clos Vougeot. Saliva-inducing and tongue quivering in finish, it superbly demonstrates the vibrancy to which 2008 vintage Pinots can aspire, and should be worth following for two decades. 

Director-winemaker Philippe Prost made no attempt to minimize the challenges of 2008 and was careful to distinguish between its wind-borne concentration and genuinely ideal phenolic maturity (approached more nearly this year in white than red). He opined that the wide window afforded for relaxed picking despite the late calendar date was critical, since the levels of ripeness were so disparate from one site to another. That said, he showed me an outstanding collection of Pinots. Ironically, as he pointed out, ripeness was also disparate in one of the two earliest vintages on record, 2007, yet picking – while fitful – was anything but relaxed due to the pressure of rot. And here, too, Bouchard scored excellent successes. By means of, where necessary, “swapping lees” between barrels to inoculate stubborn lots, Prost says he was able to get all of his 2008s through malo-lactic conversion in timely fashion, which he considers especially important with Pinot. Bottling of the 2008 reds – with a few exceptions mentioned in my notes and due to have been bottled in April – took place in December and January, the same schedule adopted for their 2007s. I did not have an opportunity to taste nearly all of Bouchard’s vast collection from either vintage, and have in the text of my notes indicated a few from among their 2008s that I take to represent significant omissions. (I have not noted “Domaine” to distinguish those wines that are part of the Bouchard, except in cases where there is another otherwise eponymous wine.)

407,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"The Bouchard 2008 Le Corton offers especially saline and spicy accents to its deep red fruit and raw meat, sirloin juice-like flavors. Cedar, fresh ginger, white pepper, blond tobacco, and vanilla bean all make for a pungent aromatic and palate display, and a rich, almost velvety texture is reconciled with the sort of nearly electric vivacity and finishing resonance of which this vintage is so singularly and memorably capable. “The middle sector of the hillside gives the silkiness and the old vines backbone,” remarks Prost but the young vines and higher elevations, he goes on to explain aid the sense of vivacity. This should prove to be worth following for the better part of two decades. What’s more, it represents amazing value not only for a grand cru but more importantly for a red Burgundy this outstanding.

Director-winemaker Philippe Prost made no attempt to minimize the challenges of 2008 and was careful to distinguish between its wind-borne concentration and genuinely ideal phenolic maturity (approached more nearly this year in white than red). He opined that the wide window afforded for relaxed picking despite the late calendar date was critical, since the levels of ripeness were so disparate from one site to another. That said, he showed me an outstanding collection of Pinots. Ironically, as he pointed out, ripeness was also disparate in one of the two earliest vintages on record, 2007, yet picking – while fitful – was anything but relaxed due to the pressure of rot. And here, too, Bouchard scored excellent successes. By means of, where necessary, “swapping lees” between barrels to inoculate stubborn lots, Prost says he was able to get all of his 2008s through malo-lactic conversion in timely fashion, which he considers especially important with Pinot. Bottling of the 2008 reds – with a few exceptions mentioned in my notes and due to have been bottled in April – took place in December and January, the same schedule adopted for their 2007s. I did not have an opportunity to taste nearly all of Bouchard’s vast collection from either vintage, and have in the text of my notes indicated a few from among their 2008s that I take to represent significant omissions. (I have not noted “Domaine” to distinguish those wines that are part of the Bouchard, except in cases where there is another otherwise eponymous wine.)

408,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"Bouchard’s 2008 Chambertin Clos de Beze smells of dark cherry and plum, dusty crushed stone, peat, and licorice, Fine grained tannins permit a caressing palate feel that fits the wine’s sumptuously rich fruit, while mineral interest lends its long finish an almost spell-binding sense of interactivity. This should be worthy of at least 15 years of attention.  There were fewer than two barriques’ worth of Bouchard Chambertin this year, and I did not taste that wine.

409,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,"A cool, almost perpetually breezy site in a vintage of cool, wind-driven concentration, results in a buoyant, refreshing, penetrating personality. Bouchard’s flagship 2008 Beaune Greves L’Enfant Jesus displays the aromatic complexity of a tobacconist’s along with a wide assortment of mouthwateringly ripe red berries and bittersweet hints of citrus oil. Sappy and bright yet richly-textured, and palate-staining in its persistent intensity of tobacco and red fruit, citrus oils, soy, and mineral salts, this superbly conveys the vibrancy of which 2008 is so notably capable, while displaying a plush sense of substantiality and ultra-fine tannins that are less common this year. I would plan to follow it for 15 or more years. Prost reports that the selection was especially rigorous this year, with most of the domaine’s Greves fruit being declassified into the Beaune du Chateau cuvee. Bouchard always presents this wine dead last in any line-up, regardless of the grand crus that might immediately precede it. While I usually list wines in the print edition of a report in the order in which they are served, I move the baby Jesus back to join its fellow Beaunes. That said, in this vintage, Bouchard’s point in serving it last is well-taken!

410,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,"Around 60% of the crop that informed Bouchard’s 2008 Volnay Caillerets Ancien Cuvee Carnot was spared by the July hail, and around 40% of that remainder declassified. But these circumstances still leave 8-9,000 bottles worth, which I tasted from tank. Musky narcissus, smoky Lapsang black tea, and black fruits on the nose lead to a silken-textured yet invigorating, subtly tart but berry-ripe palate suffused with chalk and savory salinity. This finishes with precisely the sort of “animated interchange of fruit, mineral, and inner-mouth floral elements” I credited to the 2006, and here the effect is both strikingly buoyant and positively reverberative. A bottle opened 24 hours earlier (for Michel Bettane, as it happens) had not lost any of its allure. I would look for at least 15 years of excitement.

411,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Bouchard’s 2008 Echezeaux – from the high-elevation, drought-prone En Orveaux section of that cru, ideally suited for withstanding the rigors of a dismal summer – mingles maraschino, vanilla, and chalk dust in the nose as well as on a saline, savory, saliva-inducing palate, and notes of white pepper add emphatic invigoration to a penetratingly bright finish. Whether or not further depth or low tones emerge here, we already have a handsome monument to the vintage that should be worth revisiting for at least 15 years.

Inner-mouth suggestions of faded flowers and decomposing tree stumps convey an alluring sense of decadence. Ginger and lemon rind invigorate on the finish, while deep, metaphorically dark, savory richness, nut oils, and maritime salinity well-up. There is a wealth of fascination here that should persist for at least 12-15 years.

But this persistently, dynamically interactive Pinot should continue to fascinate and stimulate – even if as something of a riddle – for 12-15 years.

414,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"Representing one of their few stragglers to go through malo very late, Bouchard’s 2008 Volnay Clos des Chenes was still in tank when I tasted it. Maritime scents of salt, kelp, along with green tea, fresh purple plum and brown spices segue into a silken yet bright palate of striking crustacean-like salinity and hints of iodine mark its sweetness as much of lobster shell reduction as of fruits or berries. Without quite the lift or vibrancy of the corresponding Caillerets, this is nonetheless long, energetic, and fine. I would expect it to keep well for 12-15 years.  I did not taste the 2008 Volnay Taillepieds, of which there are now a mere 125 cases, fruit formerly on contract from de Montille having recently reverted to that domaine.

415,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"Lightly-cooked black raspberry, smoke, and dusty crushed stone mark the nose of Bouchard’s 2008 Bonnes Mares, which generates a surprisingly soft and rounded not to mention rich palate impression for its high acid vintage and typically feisty appellation. Licorice, vanilla, and notes of game well-up in a long, soothing, black raspberry sherbet-dominated but relatively low-energy finish. Prost thinks Bonnes Mares is especially susceptible to and, in this instance, still suffering from bottle shock. I would not want to bet against this flourishing for at least 12-15 years, but suspect that its personality is temporarily damped and perhaps even a bit distorted.

Director-winemaker Philippe Prost made no attempt to minimize the challenges of 2008 and was careful to distinguish between its wind-borne concentration and genuinely ideal phenolic maturity (approached more nearly this year in white than red). He opined that the wide window afforded for relaxed picking despite the late calendar date was critical, since the levels of ripeness were so disparate from one site to another. That said, he showed me an outstanding collection of Pinots. Ironically, as he pointed out, ripeness was also disparate in one of the two earliest vintages on record, 2007, yet picking – while fitful – was anything but relaxed due to the pressure of rot. And here, too, Bouchard scored excellent successes. By means of, where necessary, “swapping lees” between barrels to inoculate stubborn lots, Prost says he was able to get all of his 2008s through malo-lactic conversion in timely fashion, which he considers especially important with Pinot. Bottling of the 2008 reds – with a few exceptions mentioned in my notes and due to have been bottled in April – took place in December and January, the same schedule adopted for their 2007s. I did not have an opportunity to taste nearly all of Bouchard’s vast collection from either vintage, and have in the text of my notes indicated a few from among their 2008s that I take to represent significant omissions. (I have not noted “Domaine” to distinguish those wines that are part of the Bouchard, except in cases where there is another otherwise eponymous wine.)

422,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse,"From their monopole south of Teurons, Bouchard’s 2008 Beaune Clos de la Mousse leads with game and fresh cherry; offers tart fruit and ginger and white pepper pungency on a consequently invigorating yet silken-textured palate; and finishes with chalky notes that accentuate both the wine’s energetic and slightly austere aspects. It’s one of those 2008s that seems as though it would be Riesling if it could pass as white. This should keep well for a decade.

423,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Monthélie 1er Cru Clos des Champs Fulliot,"Bouchard’s 2008 Monthelie Clos des Champs Fulliot smells of cherry, fresh ginger, and chalk dust, in a manner slightly reminiscent of a Volnay Clos des Chenes. Lush and refined yet bright – its fresh red fruit underlain by rich chocolate as well as chalk – this finishes with satisfyingly juicy persistence and savory salinity, further accented by hints of almond and cherry pit. I suspect it will continue to reward for at least 7-9 years.

424,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Porrets-Saint-Georges,"The Bouchard 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin – of which there are some 40,000 bottles – “is not an estate wine,” explains Prost, but “is farmed under exactly the same conditions, with our people doing all of the work.” Grenadine and dark chocolate in the nose and on a polished, fruit-filled, subtly saline palate lead to a sweet, smoke-tinged back-end. I would expect this to remain enjoyable for at least 5-7 years.  I did not taste the corresponding village level Chambolle-Musigny or Vosne-Romanee.

425,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château,"Bouchard’s multi-cru 2008 Beaune du Chateau reflects more than 70 acres of vineyards, so it can certainly fulfill its (century-old) mandate as an ambassador for Beaune as well as Bouchard! Hints of almond and pistachio extract and red berry distillates mingle with notes of leather and tobacco on the nose. A lovely amalgam of savory, saline meat stock; moss, peat, and forest floor generally; burley tobacco and brown spices; and fresh red fruits, informs a silken-textured, generous palate. This finishes with bright refreshment typical of the vintage while continuing to convey a sense of genuine depth, and I suspect it will still satisfy 10-12 years from now.

426,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"High-toned kirsch, dried cranberry, pungent white pepper, and chalk dust scent the Bouchard 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Cailles, which reflects high ripeness but at the same time high acid on an invigoratingly bright palate, culminating in a finish that positively sizzles with white pepper, tart berry skin, citrus oil, and crushed stone. Here is one of those wines of its vintage that will hold significantly more or less appeal for you depending on the degree to which you think it fine for Pinot to trespass on white wine territory. But there’s no doubt it will stimulate both your palate and discussion! I suspect it will also be worth following for a decade or more.

437,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Volnay 1er Cru Clos des Chênes,"Game and musk vie with red berries, plum, and gingerbread in the nose of Bouchard’s 2007 Volnay Clos des Chenes, which like its counterpart from the Caillerets displays an unusual energy and brightness for its vintage, and its persistently sappy fruit, invigorating spice, and vaguely animal aura will all serve for at least 6-8 further years of fascination.  

Director-winemaker Philippe Prost made no attempt to minimize the challenges of 2008 and was careful to distinguish between its wind-borne concentration and genuinely ideal phenolic maturity (approached more nearly this year in white than red). He opined that the wide window afforded for relaxed picking despite the late calendar date was critical, since the levels of ripeness were so disparate from one site to another. That said, he showed me an outstanding collection of Pinots. Ironically, as he pointed out, ripeness was also disparate in one of the two earliest vintages on record, 2007, yet picking – while fitful – was anything but relaxed due to the pressure of rot. And here, too, Bouchard scored excellent successes. By means of, where necessary, “swapping lees” between barrels to inoculate stubborn lots, Prost says he was able to get all of his 2008s through malo-lactic conversion in timely fashion, which he considers especially important with Pinot.

438,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Le Corton Grand Cru,"The Bouchard 2007 Le Corton evinces cedar, wood smoke, game, and red fruits in the nose. A sense of constriction, chalk suffusion, faintly gum-numbing tannins, and a for the vintage surprisingly tart, brash sour cherry and rhubarb fruit character combine to render this somewhat severe, although its penetration and persistence are formidable. I would want to revisit it in 2-3 years to make a call on longer-term age-worthiness, but I’m skeptical for now. What a striking contrast this makes to the extraordinary 2008. Could I have caught this one at an unusually difficult stage, I wonder?

439,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Cazetiers,"Smoky black tea, ripe plum, mace, and vanilla in the nose of Bouchard’s 2007 Gevrey-Chambertin Les Cazetiers lead to palate reflecting typically low-key virtues of its vintage, but with fine-grained tannins, persistent fruit sweetness, and attractive spice (almost certainly uninfluenced by oak, as the percentage of new wood here is negligible). I would opt to enjoy this over the next 5-7 years, though perhaps a more expressive period requires a couple of years’ patience and the wine’s potential will at that point appear longer-term.

440,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Pommard 1er Cru Les Pézerolles,"Blond tobacco and fresh ginger pungency mingle with red fruits in the nose of Bouchard’s 2007 Pommard Pezerolles, another of their 2007s to display brightness unusual for the vintage, although the persistently sappy fruit and attractive pungency of its finish are interrupted by some rather lip-numbing tannin of a sort unlikely to be shed as a result of bottle aging. Enjoy this nonetheless distinctive and admirably-concentrated Pommard over the next 4-5 years.

441,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chapelle-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Bouchard 2007 Chapelle Chambertin emphasizes the gamey, stony, chalky side of this site, in striking contrast with the intensely fruity though multi-faceted 2008 rendition. New leather and high-toned herbs play on a firmly tannic palate, with a stewed cherry and plum sense of fruit. Leather and game dominate the finish here, too, though one must credit it with formidable persistence. Yes, there is structure, but I think it would be fatuous to wait for the tannins here to “melt,” and I suspect the wine will only become more dominated by game and stones at the expense of fruit, so I’d tentatively plan to enjoy it over the next 4-6 years.

442,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Reflecting a terrace adjacent to Le Montrachet (one of four Bouchard terraces that collectively constitute around one third of this great cru) the 2007 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte offers a floral bouquet as ravishing as that of its “regular” Chevalier-Montrachet counterpart. Here the scents range from iris through orange blossom, and including that of the flowering vines themselves. This is even more penetrating yet also more rarified than its immediate sibling, with the high-toned floral notes again carrying along with citrus oils all the way into the finish, here characterized by transparency to and a dynamically shimmering interchange with saline, stony, and savory crustacean mineral elements. A hint of white pepper adds invigoration to the litany of luscious fruit and intriguing mineral characteristics of this subtly creamy-textured, uncannily buoyant expression of a great site which – although Bouchard has appealed to the authorities in past for a reclassification as Montrachet – strikes me as distinctively Chevalier in personality, or perhaps in this vintage like a cross between Montrachet and Les Preuses! I both hope and anticipate that this will be worth following for well more than a decade, but anyone lucky enough to acquire some would be crazy not to begin enjoying it young. 

Philippe Prost’s late-August starting date for the 2007 white harvest reflects not simply the enormous acreage over which Bouchard holds sway. (In fact, they can muster correspondingly large forces and their gargantuan facility with its battery of presses can handle the harvest in ten days if need be.) It is also a function of assiduous yield control that promotes ripening, and of a professed interest in capturing freshness and vivacity. Furthermore, picking extended for 18 days, until mid-September, and most of the estate’s top sites were brought in near the end. And with the exception of a Pouilly-Fuisse rendered from contract fruit, none of the 2007 whites here were chaptalized. Most came in a bit over 13% alcohol and – as Prost asserts and his wines testify – with excellent phenolic maturity. Prost prefers to avoid sulfuring the fruit or must, letting it darken from oxidation during its period of skin contact and settling because, in his view, not only the color but the flavors bounce back as soon as the juice starts fermenting, and the resulting wine is both more expressive and more stable. “You know,” he says by way of general commentary on the evolution of Bouchard vinification, “a few years ago we were too concerned to be clean and clinical” with the result that “the wines were closed,” especially in their youth. No one could level that charge at the wines now, even if some are subtle and understated. The question now – just as at other Burgundy addresses – is how white wines from the last several vintages will age. Among many recent changes made at Bouchard in the name (dare I interject, “hope”?) of reducing instances of premature oxidation and bottle variation are blanketing the assembled wines in nitrogen, a sophisticated new bottling protocol, and the use of Diam (specially treated composite) corks for village level wines and dense corks from Sardinia for crus.

443,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Bouchard’s 2007 Corton-Charlemagne – the last wine they picked – offers another of those occasions for reflecting on a bit of Burgundian craziness: a grand cru wine presented last in a stellar line-up, yet that costs on-half to one-third that of the other grand cru bottlings that preceded it. A striking and intensely pungent aroma of holly berry, fresh ginger, and lime zest leads to a vivacious, silken-textured, chalky, saline, crustacean palate. For all of this wine’s sheer intensity and palpable sense of underlying extract, it shares lift, buoyancy, and overall elegance with its Chevalier-Montrachet counterparts and preserves the energy and primary, juicy refreshment that goes with its vintage. The diversity and persistence of mineral elements here are memorable. It’s the hundredth anniversary of this Bouchard parcel (characterized by all-day luminosity), and a happy birthday indeed! Those lucky enough to acquire some of this should anticipate more than a decade of pleasure, but I would estimate that re-visiting the wine in 2-3 years would be rewarding both sensually and in terms of estimating its further evolution.

444,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru (Domaine),"A dramatic and alluring display of floral perfume rises from the glass of Bouchard 2007 Chevalier-Montrachet, suggesting iris, hibiscus, lemon blossom, and lavender. These segue into lemon oil, white peach, and Persian melon on the palate, tinged with salt and chalk and leading to a buoyant finish of lip-smacking savor, ravishing floral persistence, and hypnotic subtlety. This should be capable of inducing a rapturous trance over the coming decade, and hopefully for longer.

445,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Bouchard 2007 Montrachet is scented with peaches, ocean breezes, narcissus, musk, and a hint of sweat, setting the tone for a creamy palate brimming with richly ripe fruit and invigoratingly tinged with salt, sweat, white pepper, lemon zest, and peach fuzz. This is more emphatically concentrated than its Chevalier counterparts as well as – predictably – more overtly rich, but less alluring, and lacking the dynamic or lift that made the La Cabotte bottling especially memorable. Still it is formidably rich stuff, which one hopes will display stamina in bottle concomitant with its palate persistence. If I had some, I would not open a bottle for several years and would anticipate a decade or more of rewards.

Zesty, chalky, and saline notes add invigoration in the finish, and the high-toned aromas here suggest distilled strength, and spirituous penetration. “Penetrating” is also the word for the dynamically complex finish here.

At the same time there is a sweeter vanilla and Jordan almond side to this, high-toned herbal inflections, and an even stonier mineral dimension. This finishes with lift and layered complexity, if not yet quite that of its 2006 counterpart. I would feel confident in following it for 8-10 years, although Prost and Bouchard commercial director Stephane Follin-Arbelet insist longer.

Faintly toasty and vanillin notes creep in with similarly harmonious effect, and for all of its sumptuousness, this retains some genuine refreshment in its finish by way of peach flesh and primary citrus juiciness. There are only 200 cases (8 barrels) of this – a relatively small lot by Bouchard standards.

Yet, it also reflects the character of 2007 in displaying a for this site unusual degree of mineral nuance and acid retention, with the result that a pithy core of chalk and stone as well as toasted nut and a bright note of lemon balance the wine’s opulent richness.

450,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chalumaux,"From purchased fruit that amounts to 200 cases of wine, Bouchard’s 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Chalumeaux smells mouth-wateringly of Persian melon, white peach, and iris; comes onto the palate with delicacy, refinement, and discretion; and finishes with subtle harmony of floral perfume, chalk, and ripe peach and melon. A greater contrast with the psychologically warm, forward richness of the Champ Gain could hardly be imagined. Here too, I would anticipate a wine worth following for 5-7 years, but one that demands sensitive ears to hear its song.  

Philippe Prost’s late-August starting date for the 2007 white harvest reflects not simply the enormous acreage over which Bouchard holds sway. (In fact, they can muster correspondingly large forces and their gargantuan facility with its battery of presses can handle the harvest in ten days if need be.) It is also a function of assiduous yield control that promotes ripening, and of a professed interest in capturing freshness and vivacity. Furthermore, picking extended for 18 days, until mid-September, and most of the estate’s top sites were brought in near the end. And with the exception of a Pouilly-Fuisse rendered from contract fruit, none of the 2007 whites here were chaptalized. Most came in a bit over 13% alcohol and – as Prost asserts and his wines testify – with excellent phenolic maturity. Prost prefers to avoid sulfuring the fruit or must, letting it darken from oxidation during its period of skin contact and settling because, in his view, not only the color but the flavors bounce back as soon as the juice starts fermenting, and the resulting wine is both more expressive and more stable. “You know,” he says by way of general commentary on the evolution of Bouchard vinification, “a few years ago we were too concerned to be clean and clinical” with the result that “the wines were closed,” especially in their youth. No one could level that charge at the wines now, even if some are subtle and understated. The question now – just as at other Burgundy addresses – is how white wines from the last several vintages will age.

451,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"Representing Bouchard’s very small holdings in that site, their 2007 Meursault Charmes smells of toasted almond and hazelnut, candied lime, and quince, Juicy and refreshing; brimming with lemon and white peach and yellow plum on the palate; and with toasty, nutty, honeyed underlying character, it offers lots of immediate appeal – while no doubt being worth following for at least half a dozen years. As Prost points out, “Charmes is very heterogeneous. This is Charmes Dessous, near the Route Nationale, not all of which is capable of truly great wine or consistent mineral complexity.” The estate’s own parcels in this sector are declassified to the village Meursault, but this portion is clearly worthy of showcasing separately. I would plan to enjoy it over the next 4-5 years.

452,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Bouchard’s 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Folatieres – from purchased fruit – resembles its Champ Gain sibling in richness and warmth, except that the latter is not entirely metaphorical in this instance. Along with smoky toast in the finish comes a hint of heat (despite only 13.5% alcohol) that I seldom noted in this year’s Bouchard collection. That said, I don’t wish to under-estimate the appeal of this wine’s textural sumptuousness and ripe peach and pineapple fruit, even if they are embedded in a context that is not especially vintage-typical. I would anticipate it being best enjoyed over the next 4-5 years.

453,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru du Château Blanc,"As usual marrying fruit from four sites (principally Sizie and adjacent Aigrots – in total Bouchard controls around one-third of the Beaune’s 30 hectares of white grapes), the 2007 Beaune du Chateau smells alluringly of flowers and ripe pear and quince; offers a creamy texture and polished integration of stony mineral notes, inner-mouth floral perfume, and ripe orchard fruits; and finishes with soothing though not emphatic persistence. It would be a shame not to enjoy this right away, although I suspect it will continue to pay dividends for at least 4-5 years in bottle.

As Prost explains, this village continues to be a prime source for grape contracts with smaller land holders, in large part simply because its high water table mitigates the likelihood of a grower having his or her own cellar.  Hyacinth and ripe peach in the nose follow on a relatively delicate yet subtly creamy palate, with chalky and saline notes adding interest to a satisfyingly juicy finish.

Seven parcels were tapped for this, and around 20% of the juice or young wine was declassified into the Beaune du Chateau. Imagine roasted, still bloody lamb seasoned with pungent herbs and accompanied by a tart compote of black fruits and you have the overall impression of this deeply rich cru with its persistent layering of flavors.

This preserves a lip-smacking sense of primary juiciness, and vintage-typical buoyancy that is less common within the Cote de Nuits half of this particular collection. I would anticipate it's being worth following for a half dozen years, perhaps longer.

468,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chambertin Grand Cru,"A domaine wine from the late-ripening upper reaches of the site, Bouchard's 2006 Chambertin (of which there are only 50 cases) was not destemmed at all. Ripe black fruits, peat, and rose petals strikingly scent this firmly tannic and impressively concentrated effort. Salty, meaty, tartly berry-fruited and almost palpably mineral, it finishes with impressive grip of not finesse. This should be revisited in the course of 2010, and is likely to have at least 6-8 years of cellar potential.

Inner-mouth floral perfume and esterous high-tones persist throughout, and there is a cool restraint and stoniness that seem to reflect the wine's geological origins. A sinewy sense of structure is accompanied by some superficial tannic abrasiveness, which the fruit successfully rides out. I would plan on following this for 4-6 years, but – as with so many of the wines in this collection, and indeed this whole vintage – I'm skeptical about long-term dividends.

I'd like to see more primary juiciness to the finish here, but this is amply ripe and structured as well as reductively tight, and I expect it will perform well for 4-6 years.

Tightly-knit and firm in feel, this gets its richness from its carnality, with a nod in the direction of dark berries. The overall impression is somewhat somber and austere, but formidably dense and persistent. I would revisit it in a couple of years, and anticipate its being worth following for several more thereafter. A portion of the fruit for this was not destemmed, an approach taken by Bouchard this year with a number of their grand crus as well.

Satisfyingly sweet black and red berry fruits well up on the palate as this takes on air, with the tartness of skins and bitterness of pits adding invigoration to a finish of welcome refreshment and transparency to smoky, mineral nuances.

491,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Bouchard 2006 Montrachet offers scents of ripe peach and apricot; saline, savory pan drippings; patisserie-like marzipan and buttered, fruit paste-filled pastry; and exotic, sweet, lily-like floral essences. Deep, savory, meaty and mysteriously mineral undertones compliment the implosively-concentrated fruit essence of this palpably unctuous, powerful yet persistently invigorating wine. It combines head-turning beauty with eyebrow-lifting intrigue and should remain so for at least two decades. 

In keeping with what he says are his usual intuitions, Philippe Prost picked early – bringing in Chardonnay ahead of Pinot Noir for the first time at Bouchard since 1989 – so as to retain freshness as well as what he termed “the sense of minerality in a vintage of very ripe fruit. But in 1989,” he hastens to add, “yields were perhaps overly generous, whereas in 2006 they are quite reasonable.” The results are consistently impressive. New barrels are generally “seasoned” here through use in wines of lesser appellation (other portions of which are frequently raised in tank), as Prost prefers to employ second year barrels for most of his crus. Injections of inert gas at bottling are among the techniques being used to protect the young wines here from oxidation.

492,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"That the team at Bouchard presents their 2006 Corton-Charlemagne for tasting last of all certainly reflects confidence in their holdings (high up in a southeast-facing original “Le Corton”) as well as in their affinity for the site. Grapefruit, lime, yellow plum, and chalk in the nose lead to a pungent, tart concentration of citrus and pit fruit essences and an implacable stoniness that leave the palate stained, yet all the while invigorated. In fact, this leaves one’s tongue positively aquiver. It needs some years to really show what is at present only incipient complexity, but exhibits a balanced youthful intensity that promise well over a decade of positive evolution. Certainly an investment in a bottle or two of this represents a bargain when compared with its grand cru siblings from further south.

493,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru (Domaine),"Mint, talcum, marzipan, and candied lemon dominate the penetratingly high-toned aromas of their 2006 Chevalier-Montrachet, which exhibits a remarkable alliance of textural richness and citric brightness, and a finish of fascinating, low-toned, chalk, stone, citrus zest, and nut oils. For all of the sheer ripeness on display here, there is no sense of superficial sweetness, with fresh lime saturating a palate of formidable density and imposingly ripe pit fruits. And for all of this wine’s more than 14% alcohol, there is barely a hint of warmth. It exhibits to an even greater degree than the corresponding Meursault Perrieres a nearly ineffable, for lack of a better word “mineral” character, as well as an uncanny combination of amplitude and elegance; sheer mass yet vivacity. This memorably long beauty should age well for at least a dozen years.

494,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte Grand Cru,"Reflecting a terrace adjacent to Le Montrachet (and for which Bouchard has in fact appealed the classification), the 2006 Chevalier-Montrachet La Cabotte sacrifices some of the brightness and elegance of the “regular” bottling for the sake of even more enveloping richness, amplitude, and sheer density. A bitter-sweet amalgam of over-ripe peach, plum, litchi, fruit pits, candied citrus, and toasted nuts is noticeably marked by the vanilla of new wood, and while the finish is formidable, it lacks the refinement, elegance, or mineral intrigue of its immediate sibling. Time will probably continue to take these two Chevalier Montrachet bottlings ever-further apart, with the Cabotte displaying the kinship with its yet more famous neighbor. Certainly a comparison any time over at least the next dozen years would prove fascinating for those few wine lovers who can afford it.

Ginger snaps, malt, honey, lime, apricot, and walnut inform the rich, creamy palate. Yet, buoyancy, elegance, and clarity are not sacrificed, and the chalky, stony inflections that complicate the long finish fascinatingly and eloquently speak to the mysteriously mineral aura that haunts all of the better wines from this superb cru. I can see no reason to defer the pleasure of this youthfully expressive Perrieres, but it ought to stand up to at least 6-8 years in the cellar.

Overtones of lanolin and vanilla from the barrel compliment the relative austerity of the basic material, and there is no lack of primary juiciness carrying into a long, piquant, stonily mineral, faintly warm finish.

Managing director Stephane Follin and cellar master Philippe Prost preside over a remarkable new, gravity-fed winemaking facility capable of handling the fruits of Bouchard’s 130 hectares of vines – Burgundy’s largest estate (with 84 hectares in premier and grand crus alone) – not to mention the enormous range of wine from purchased fruit or wines. Fully 40% of the reds are vinified in open-top fermenters with manual punch-downs (the balance in a battery of roto-fermentors) and the system of traffic control alone that must be in place during crush is hard to imagine. The underground acreage devoted to barriques similarly defies imagination – until one sees it. Prost was very cautious with pigeage this year, but incorporated a significant percentage of whole clusters with stems in many of his better lots. A reputation for improved quality is being built here to which the results of 2005 will certainly contribute. I suspect that a number of the wines I tasted had not recovered from their recent bottling, hence the number of “+?”s one sees displayed following my scores.

Managing director Stephane Follin and cellar master Philippe Prost preside over a remarkable new, gravity-fed winemaking facility capable of handling the fruits of Bouchard’s 130 hectares of vines – Burgundy’s largest estate (with 84 hectares in premier and grand crus alone) – not to mention the enormous range of wine from purchased fruit or wines. Fully 40% of the reds are vinified in open-top fermenters with manual punch-downs (the balance in a battery of roto-fermentors) and the system of traffic control alone that must be in place during crush is hard to imagine. The underground acreage devoted to barriques similarly defies imagination – until one sees it. Prost was very cautious with pigeage this year, but incorporated a significant percentage of whole clusters with stems in many of his better lots. A reputation for improved quality is being built here to which the results of 2005 will certainly contribute. I suspect that a number of the wines I tasted had not recovered from their recent bottling, hence the number of “+?”s one sees displayed following my scores.

514,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"There are only four barrels of Bouchard’s 2005 Bonnes Mares. Brightly scented with tart, fresh black raspberry along with resin and sage pungency, this displays the almost savage intensity characteristic of its site, as well as slightly obstreperous tannins and a hint of heat in its brambly, concentrated finish. This high-toned, lean, persistent Pinot may calm down and fill out a bit over the next few months. It certainly seems capable of rewarding a decade or more of cellaring.

Raspberry and strawberry preserves, wood smoke, and roasted meats dominate the nose and palate.

525,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons,"The Bouchard 2005 Beaune Teurons offers aromas and sweet-tart flavors of rhubarb and cherry, mingled with brown spices, toasted nuts, and what I take to be site-typical smokiness. With invigorating bright fruit, pungent spice and smokiness and lots of sap and grip, this acquits itself well now and should reward at least 6-8 years of cellaring. 

Managing director Stephane Follin and cellar master Philippe Prost preside over a remarkable new, gravity-fed winemaking facility capable of handling the fruits of Bouchard’s 130 hectares of vines – Burgundy’s largest estate (with 84 hectares in premier and grand crus alone) – not to mention the enormous range of wine from purchased fruit or wines. Fully 40% of the reds are vinified in open-top fermenters with manual punch-downs (the balance in a battery of roto-fermentors) and the system of traffic control alone that must be in place during crush is hard to imagine. The underground acreage devoted to barriques similarly defies imagination – until one sees it. Prost was very cautious with pigeage this year, but incorporated a significant percentage of whole clusters with stems in many of his better lots.

740,Bouchard Pere et Fils,Montrachet Grand Cru,"On January 17, 1997, a Belgian wine merchant held a comprehensive tasting of virtually every  Montrachet at the Crillon Hotel in Paris. In addition to myself, Pierre Rovani was the only other American in attendance. The group was evenly split between members of the Belgian/French wine trade and private consumers. I was permitted to insert several top California Chardonnays in the tasting as ""ringers."" I provided the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge and the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. The tasting was impeccably organized, with the wines served blind in multiple flights. The results, although not unbelievable to me, were shocking to the group of serious Belgian and French wine tasters. Two of the French tasters were well-known winemakers. One of them who asked to remain anonymous proclaimed that in large part, the group of Montrachets was ""a crime against France's patrimony."" The group overwhelmingly rated the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge the top wine. Several tasters recognized that it was a California wine, but they still felt it was by far the most compelling, complex, and complete wine of the tasting. Second place went to another ""ringer,"" the  Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Le Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, third place was awarded to the  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne another ringer, and fourth place went to yet another ""ringer,"" the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. Of the Montrachets, three producers produced wines that certainly merited outstanding ratings. The fifth place wine was the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti  Montrachet; sixth place went to Domaine Lafon's  Montrachet; and seventh place was the  Domaine Ramonet Montrachet.

My numerical ratings generally mirrored the group's, with the Peter Michael Pointe Rouge receiving 97 points, Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, 95;  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne, 96+; Mount Eden 1992 Chardonnay Estate, 94; DRC  Montrachet, 93; Domaine Lafon  Montrachet, 91+; Domaine Ramonet  Montrachet, 90+; and most of the other Montrachets in the mid to upper-eighties, except for the appalling  Montrachets from Delagrange-Bachelet and Rene Fleurot. A tropical fruit-scented, disjointed the acidity stuck out as it does in many New World Chardonnays  Robert Drouhin Montrachet Marquis de la Guiche was another underachiever. Only four of the Montrachets possessed the depth and richness or the group's top three wines. Perhaps the most remarkable conclusion of this tasting was that none of the Montrachets displayed the complexity of the group's favorite three wines. And let's not hear any whining about these Montrachets needing 5-10, perhaps 15 years of cellaring. That may be the case in vintages such as 1986 or 1995, but the  Montrachets are extremely forward, low acid wines except those that appeared to have had far too much acidity added. Too many of them were diluted, disjointed, flabby, and flat compared to the non-Montrachet wines of this tasting.

Much is being made in European wine writing circles about American versus European tastes, another phony non-issue by writers who would better serve their readership by doing more tasting than pontificating. While no single tasting can be considered definitive, this particular tasting did prove that a group of French and Belgian tasters exhibited a preference for California Chardonnays. C'est la vie.

751,Bouchard Pere et Fils,La Romanée Grand Cru,"There can be little doubt that Bouchard's finest wine is La Romanee, a wine with an extraordinary fragrance reminiscent of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti's La Tache or Romanee-Conti. The 1990 offers aromas of smoked game and Asian spices, combined with lavish quantities of sweet, jammy black fruits and new oak.  There is spectacular depth and richness.  Moderate tannins are present, but this wine is irresistible because of abundant sweet, opulent, rich fruit, full body, and its velvety texture.  If you can find a few bottles of this treasure, cellar them for 3-4 years.  It should drink well for the next 15 years.

There has been a total reversal of the winemaking philosophy at Bouchard Pere et Fils.  This is one of the wealthiest firms in France, as well as the largest landowner of premier and grand crus in Burgundy.  For years their wines, while commercially acceptable, were uninspiring.  Yields were not limited, excessive amounts of SO2 were employed, the wines were processed and racked excessively, and, most damaging, they were aggressively filtered, often with sterile micropore filters.  Inspired by the exceptional success enjoyed by such negociant firms as Faiveley and Louis Jadot (they had stopped filtering all of their premier and grand crus by 1988, opting for a minimal interventionist process in their winemaking), Paul Bouchard and his son Jean-Francois have begun to turn out their finest wines since the forties and fifties.  The wines are deeper-colored and noticeably more concentrated.  All the premier crus and grand crus are bottled with minimal additions of SO2, and are not filtered.  Consequently, as the notes and scores reveal, there has been a significant leap in quality.  Kudos to Bouchard Pere et Fils for recognizing that improvements had to be made, and for having the courage to implement them.

Like all of these premier crus, as well as the Bourgogne-Chardonnay and village Meursault, Les Pucelles should be drunk over the next 6-8 years.

Since 1989 the white wines have been put through malolactic and vinified in barrels, of which 15% are new.

798,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots is showing very well, wafting from the glass with a complex aromatic mélange of dark berry fruit, orange rind, peonies, cinnamon, smoked meats and rich spices that are framed by a nicely integrated application of new oak and strongly recall the wines of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and muscular, with powdery tannins that assert themselves more and more prominently the longer the wine sits in the glass, good concentration at the core and ripe but lively acids. This Suchots is still a few years away from attaining its plenitude, but its quality is already apparent.",,RP 93

The palate is lifted on the entry with a slight biscuit-like note infusing the red fruit. Tart red cherries, brown spices, a touch of cooked meat towards the finish complete this well-crafted Vosne-Romanée that should give several years drinking pleasure. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 93

These are collected together from the domaine's holdings and blended to form this cuvée. It has a brisk, slightly leafy bouquet (in fact, you might think a few stems found their way into the vat!). The palate is well balanced with light tannin, an easy-drinking Pinot Noir with tart red cherries, tapering towards a light finish. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 93
801,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Hautes-Maizières,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Vosne-Romanée Haut Maizières 1999 is a deeply impressive wine from Domaine Prieure-Roch, especially considering this is not a premier cru vineyard. It has a dense redcurrant, raspberry and crushed rose-petal bouquet that is quite backward considering that it already has 15 years or so in bottle. The palate is powerful, quite muscular at first with a fine line of acidity and then with aeration it achieves more and more finesse, especially on the multilayered and pure finish. It actually deserves another three or four years in bottle. Wow.",,RP 93
802,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a ridiculously fine village cru for the vintage. It has a cohesive and focused bouquet with smoke, sea salt and a scent of bracken that lends real personality. After 10-15 minutes, it develops a slight graphite note that lends it masculinity. The palate is medium-bodied with a sensual opening that belies what are very fine tannins. The acidity here is extremely well-judged with a lovely dash of spice toward the peacock tail finish. After one hour, this wine is really opening with panache and style, so I recommend a couple of hours decanting or further bottle age. Wonderful. Drink 2016-2026.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
803,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2008 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a little lean and herbaceous on the nose and already shows some age on the rim. There is a slight vegetal tincture that becomes less prominent with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with soft, fleshy fruit, but it is missing some depth and structure toward the seaweed-tinged finish. This was a curious showing. Drink now-2017.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
804,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2007 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte initially has what you might describe as a funky nose, slightly bretty at first, although that seems to clear with an hour in the glass to reveal some ripe Morello cherry and wild strawberry scents. There is also a stemminess in situ, although that ebbs away with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with fine crisp tannins – a structured Le Clos Goillotte with more matiere than the previous vintage. This improves in the glass and evolves a lovely cohesive ferrous finish. This is very fine, but I would give it another two years in bottle. Drink 2016-2026+.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
805,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2006 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a slightly diffuse and leathery bouquet that compared to other vintages seems rather dour. The palate is tart on the entry with slightly rasping acidity, foursquare and masculine, and lacking a little substance for the first hour or so, although returning later it does coalesce and gain more weight. This is a mercurial Le Clos Goillotte that changes dramatically in the glass but never reaches the heights of other vintages. Drink now-2018.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
806,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2005 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a deep purple hue. The nose offers attractive dark cherries, red plum and a touch of sous-bois, a marine influence becoming more prominent with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with pure cranberry and cassis notes on the entry, tobacco just tangible underneath. There is good structure here although, like many 2005s, the wine remains backward, and is missing a little persistency on the finish. Returning after 30 minutes there is an attractive bacon fat/Italian cured meat note infusing the aromatics and it seems to stretch its wings and manifest more vigor. This is a lovely 2005 Vosne-Romanee but afford it an hour’s decanting. Drink now-2020.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
807,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"Served from magnum, the 2001 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is a very commendable wine for the vintage. It has an attractive fungal, sous-bois-scented bouquet with a touch of blueberry and wild mint. After 13 years, this is still fresh and has a pleasing purity. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins and crisp acidity, with bitter red cherries defining the finish. What a splendid wine for the vintage. Drink now-2019.  Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
808,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 2000 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte has a slightly bretty nose with sous-bois and Provencal herbs dominating, later some wild fennel and broom. The palate is showing a touch of underripeness and there is some volatile acidity masking the finish. This feels as if it would have been better several years ago, but here it is clearly surpassed by the 2001. Drink now. Tasted May 2014.",,RP 93
809,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"Tasted from magnum, the 1999 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is initially a little scrawny both on the nose and the palate, but don’t be fooled – it’s just toying with you. Observing the wine over two hours, it coalesces on the nose with scents of red berries, iron rust, chestnut and Provencal herbs – fully mature but divine. The palate similarly seems to be at its peak, but there is certainly good substance here with marmalade, bay leaf and leather infusing the degraded red fruit. There is something autumnal about this Clos Goillotte, but with aeration it certainly still gives much pleasure. I would be more cautious with respect to 750ml examples. Drink now-2017.

810,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Vosne-Romanée Le Clos Goillotte,"The 1996 Vosne-Romanee Le Clos Goillotte is dominated by excessive brettanoymces on the nose that obscures any sense of terroir or fruit concentration.

811,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Perno Vigna Santo Stefano,"The Giuseppe Mascarello 2011 Barolo Perno Vigna Santo Stefano is an opulent and fruit-forward Nebbiolo that shows the ripe side of Monteforte d'Alba. The wine exhibits richness and softness and other succulent characteristics that are correctly associated with the hot 2011 vintage. But this estate always shows a deft hand, most especially when it comes to bringing out the elegance and grace of Nebbiolo. You get those qualities here in the context of a warm vintage. 
",,RP 93
812,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Nebbiolo,"The 2011 Langhe Nebbiolo opens to a pretty garnet color with raw notes of cherry, spice and light tobacco. It delivers authentic Nebbiolo characteristics in an informal, easy-drinking package. Floral notes of pressed rose and dried violets rise from the bouquet. It also shows some rusticity and tartness in the mouth. ",,RP 93
813,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"A landmark wine, the 2009 Barolo Monprivato does not disappoint. The wine shows a medium garnet color and offers a full bouquet of red rose, pressed flowers, wild berries, spice, tar and licorice. Some distant white truffle also makes a subtle appearance at the back. The mouthfeel is absolutely polished and clean with silky tannins, balanced acidity and firm textural support. This is a lovely edition of Barolo Monprivato to store in your cellars ten years or more. ",,RP 93
814,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Vigna Santo Stefano Perno,"Showing spicy and savory characteristics, the 2009 Barolo Vigna Santo Stefano Perno is a highly individualistic wine. Those pretty embellishments of cinnamon, cardamom and white pepper make for an excellent contrast to the wine's softer fruity and floral side. Barolo Vigna Santo Stefano Perno performs magically in the mouth with smooth tannins and extra intensity on the finish. Its persistence is impressive and meaningful. ",,RP 93
815,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo,"Giuseppe Mascarello's 2009 Barolo is light and luminous. This is a gorgeous expression that shows the best side of the Nebbiolo grape in this warm vintage. The bouquet is clean and straightforward, and the wine's appearance sports a bright ruby hue. The bouquet offers a slew of enticing details. There is dried currant, wild berry, violet, rose, cola and licorice. The tannins are both supple and silky. This is a beautiful wine that should hold long in your cellar. ",,RP 93
816,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Villero,"A gorgeous wine, the 2009 Barolo Villero is drinking beautifully right now. This is in part due to the softer, more approachable style of the 2009 vintage. Barolo Villero shows a great level of aromatic intensity and pureness that immediately pops from the glass. Silky but firm tannins are enhanced by notes of dried fruit, cassis, pressed flower and licorice. The mouthfeel is incredibly silky and firm. ",,RP 93
817,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Freisa Toetto,"The 2009 Langhe Freisa Toetto opens to a savory dark color and dark fruit intensity. The results are luscious and spicy with deep layers of blackberry, resin and tobacco. There is a meaty and savory quality to this wine that you don't often get with the fresh and easy-going Freisa grape. One important point of consideration: Freisa is not usually made as a cellar-worthy wine. The Mascarello family breaks the rules and presents a wine with the structure and sturdiness for a five-year drinking window, possibly longer. ",,RP 93
818,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Superiore Scudetto,"The 2009 Barbera d'Alba Superiore Scudetto opens to slightly sweet sensations of black cherry, pressed currant, licorice, tar, tobacco and road paving. It offers a very interesting window onto the aging trajectory of the naturally acidic Barbera grape. The wine reveals the generous fullness and roundness that is typical of the Alba appellation. Soft tannins and dark fruit flavors wrap over the palate. ",,RP 93
819,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Superiore Codamonte,"The 2009 Barbera d'Alba Superiore Codamonte opens to medium dark extraction and dark ruby intensity. The bouquet is not totally polished and that slightly muddled or rustic personality is part of its charm. The wine is redolent of pressed roses, wild berries, savory spice and soft tobacco. There is sharp, lively quality to the mouthfeel that is reinforced by the wine's natural acidity and its polished tannins. ",,RP 93
820,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"Mauro Mascarello does not disappoint with his stunning 2010 Barolo Monprivato. This is an impeccable expression from Castiglione Falletto that imparts an immense sense of purity and elegance. The bouquet opens slowly to reveal pressed flower, cola, dried ginger, forest fruit and balsam herb. This is a magnificent expression of Nebbiolo that changes and shifts each time you come back to contemplate its aromas. That magical fluidity is also present in the mouth. The wine presents silky tannins and crisp fruit flavors. Given the sheer quality on display now, you can count on Barolo Monprivato to continue a slow and successful evolution in your cellar. This is a true beauty. ",,RP 93
821,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Vigna Santo Stefano Perno,"Nebbiolo enthusiasts will be charmed by the 2010 Barolo Vigna Santo Stefano Perno. This beautiful expression offers ample grace and elegance with focused sharpness and a carefully delineated feel. The bouquet reveals tones of wild berry, crushed mineral, white pepper and dried ginger. The wine's balsamic characteristics help to amplify its beauty and delicate intensity. Nuanced tones of rose petal and dried violets appear softly on the long finish. ",,RP 93
822,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Villero,"The 2010 Barolo Villero is shaped in a classic style with 36 month of aging in botte grande. In line with tradition, it presents a sharp and streamlined style with a feminine and elegant personality. Instead of muscle and brawn, it boasts length and persistency. Its appearance is thin and bright with luminous garnet hues. In the mouth, the wine is focused and pristine with supple, silky tannins. It promises to flesh out further with additional cellar aging. 
",,RP 93
823,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"From a bottle caked in mud and dust acquired over two decades in the cellar, 1990 Barolo Monprivato is a fascinating and epic wine. I tasted bottle number 00982. It pours from the glass with a garnet ruby color that shows a translucent, brilliant appearance. The bouquet is fine and elegant with a long parade of varietal aromas spanning from forest berry and cola to white truffle and pressed violets. It’s a wine of a million fine points and hidden details that reveal themselves seductively and slowly. As the bouquet takes on more air, a new set of aromas with spice and dark espresso begin to emerge. The mouthfeel is equally elegant and fine with silky tannins and points of bright acidity that add a great sense of dimension and energy. It’s a gorgeous expression of Nebbiolo and one of the most profound and beautiful Barolos I tasted in this retrospective. Medicinal and menthol notes drive a beautifully long and complex finish. Give the wine plenty of decanting time; 12 hours or more. Drink: 2014-2024. ",,RP 93
824,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Nebbiolo,"Mascarello’s 2010 Langhe Nebbiolo floats on the palate with sweet dried cherries, crushed flowers, tobacco and anise. This light-bodied, Burgundian Nebbiolo is quite pretty, even if at times it comes across as a touch fragile. There is an element of understated grip on the finish that is undeniably appealing. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.  

Mauro Mascarello’s 2008 Baroli have closed down considerably since I tasted them from cask in November, 2011. The 2008s were just bottled a few months ago. I expect they will be more expressive in another 6-12 months. Overall, the 2008s are mid-weight wines built on grace and perfume. I don’t see the pure power of 2006 nor the opulence of 2007, to name two recent vintages, but wines that are built more along the lines of 2005. I expect the 2008s will age on their acidity rather than fruit, but these wines always have a way of transforming in bottle, so we will see. There is little doubt Nebbiolo did better here than Barbera in 2008, as was true throughout Piemonte. The 2008 Barberas are good, but average, or perhaps slightly better than that within the context of the estate’s long, established history.

825,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"Readers will have to be especially patient with the 2008 Barolo Monprivato, a wine that has none of the early appeal of other recent vintages. Still very much closed in on itself, the 2008 possesses serious depth, power and structure, but those elements are suppressed by the recent bottling. Dried rose petals, crushed berries and mint are some of the nuances that flesh out on the powerful, imposing finish. I don’t think the 2008 will ever match the 2006 or 2007, but it is going to be fun seeing how close it gets. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2048.

A sweet floral bouquet melds into expressive red berries in this firm, tightly wound wine. The Santo Stefano has clamped down significantly post-bottling. It will be interesting to see how long it takes for the wine to open up, but it was unquestionably more flattering from cask. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2033.

827,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Villero,"The 2008 Barolo Villero stands out first and foremost for its pure silkiness. An understated wine, the 2008 graces the palate with subtle fruit, expressive aromatics and a long finish supported by polished tannins. This is one of the more delicate, understated vintages of the Villero I can remember tasting. The aromas and flavors are still very much primary, but I wouldn’t wait too long on the 2008, as it doesn’t seem built for the super long haul. Still, I very much like the way the wine develops with time in the glass. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2018.

There is little doubt Nebbiolo did better here than Barbera in 2008, as was true throughout Piemonte. The 2008 Barberas are good, but average, or perhaps slightly better than that within the context of the estate’s long, established history.

828,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2008 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Santo Stefano di Perno impresses for its length and pure textural silkiness. Sweet red berries, tobacco, incense and dried flowers are all woven together in a fabric of beauty and class. Sweet floral notes add lift on the feminine, gracious finish. This is another delicious Barbera from the Mascarello family. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2018.  

Mauro Mascarello’s 2008 Baroli have closed down considerably since I tasted them from cask in November, 2011. The 2008s were just bottled a few months ago. I expect they will be more expressive in another 6-12 months. Overall, the 2008s are mid-weight wines built on grace and perfume.

829,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Scudetto,"A super classic profile of dark plums, licorice, menthol, savory herbs and violets wrap around the palate as the 2008 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Scudetto blasts onto the palate. This is the most overt, forward of Mascarellos 2008 Barberas. There is an immediacy to the fruit that is highly appealing. Within the context of the vintage, I also find good mid-palate pliancy in this medium-bodied, tasty Barbera. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.

830,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Superiore Codamonte,"The 2008 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Codamonte is the wine previously known as Codana. It is another wine with good immediacy, but significantly less in the way of complexity or structure by historical standards. The 2008 is a mid-weight Codamonte (or Codana) best suited for drinking over the next few years. I don’t find the complexity or structure of the best years. Call me old-fashioned, but it simply kills me to see distinguished wines such as the Barbera Codana literally disappear just because bureaucrats haven’t carefully thought out the ramifications of changing naming conventions for Barolo’s best vineyards. Codana is a historic wine, now relegated to a memory. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2016.

831,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Riserva Monprivato Cà d'Morissio,"The 2004 Barolo Riserva Monprivato Ca d’Morissio is totally seamless and beautiful. It possesses gorgeous textural richness and finesse with virtually no perception of tannin. Rose petals, flowers, raspberries and mint come alive in the glass, but it is the wine’s subtle yet insistent chalky minerality that is the thread that holds the wine together. This is a hugely impressive Barolo with a bright future. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2034. 

One of the great tastings in Piemonte is sitting down with Mauro Mascarello and his son Giuseppe, and going through all of their wines from barrel. Vintage 2008 is looking good so far. The wines have great transparency to site and plenty of personality. Mascarello planned to bottle the 2008 Baroli during the summer of 2012.

Dark cherries, flowers, spices and minerals emerge as this powerful, intense Barolo shows off its inimitable pedigree. The 2001 isn’t likely to be one of the biggest Ca d’Morissios, but it is impeccable and totally satisfying in every way. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2031. 

Mauro Mascarello’s 2001s showed very well. I have had the privilege of attending more than my fair share of Monprivato verticals, but something tells me future tastings are going to be even more special, as the number of great examples of this wine has never been higher.

833,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"The 2001 Barolo Monprivato is striking. It boasts gorgeous textural depth and richness to match its highly expressive, compelling aromatics. The wine has begun to soften a touch. Though not at all forbidding at this stage, the 2001 Monprivato remains an infant with at least two more decades of fine drinking ahead. This is a gorgeous effort from Mauro Mascarello. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2031.

The exotic aromatics – which can be pronounced when the wine is young – have begun to meld into the fruit. There is plenty of richness and depth in the glass, but the overall impression is one of softness and delicateness. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2021.

835,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Nebbiolo,"The 2009 Langhe Nebbiolo is a delicate, pretty wine. Sweet red cherries, crushed flowers and spices are some of the notes that flow from this open, textured Nebbiolo. Mint, flowers and sweet herbs develop in the glass, adding further notes of complexity. The Langhe Nebbiolo makes an excellent introduction to the house style. With time in the glass the wine comes together beautifully. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2017.  

This is a stellar showing from Mauro and Giuseppe Mascarello. The 2007 Baroli are stunning now that they are in bottle, but the Barberas are equally worthy of attention. As always, the style is very traditional, but in 2007 the steady warmth of the vintage has given the wines an extra dimension of fleshiness. The 2007 Monprivato in particular is shaping up to be another legendary Barolo from Mascarello.

836,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"The 2007 Barolo Monprivato is stunningly beautiful. Monprivato is seldom this rich when it is young. It is most often intensely aromatic, mid-weight and frequently out of balance, especially right after bottling. The 2007 is none of those things. It is a rich, dramatic wine endowed with tons of fruit and a sweeping, enveloping personality. It is also primary and at the beginning of what is likely to be a long, long life. Despite its seeming fragility, Monprivato is one of the most long-lived of all Baroli, even in its weakest vintages. The 2007 is spectacular, but it is very, very young and in need of significant cellaring to shed some its baby fat. Purists may prefer the 2006. I have not tasted both wines side by side from bottle, but 10 years from now it won’t matter. Readers will be thrilled to own either. In 2007 Mascarello opted not to bottle his Riserva Ca’ d’Morissio as he didn’t think there was a huge difference between the Riserva and the straight Monprivato. I guess we will never know for sure, although my barrel tastings have always suggested otherwise. In any event, savvy readers know what happens when there is no Ca’ d’Morissio in a good to great vintage. Recent examples include the 1999 and 2005. By now, its pretty clear the direction those wines have taken. Barolo lovers will not want to be without the 2007 Monprivato. It is a stratospheric Barolo in the making. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2037.

837,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2007 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno rarely gets mentioned in a discussion of this great property but several recent vintages have been outstanding, which is the case with the 2007 as well. Sweet dark cherries, menthol, pine, minerals and flowers are some of the notes that flesh out in the glass. The 2007 is a striking Santo Stefano di Perno loaded with site specific detail but with an extra layer of richness that is the signature of the year. Clean, mineral notes frame the energetic, vibrant finish. This is every bit as fabulous as it was from barrel. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2027.

If there were such a thing as grand cru Barbera, this would be one of the wines on that list. The Codana is a complete wine that brings together aromatics, fruit and structure in a totally compelling Barbera of the highest level. Clean, saline notes support a radiant core of sweet perfumed dark fruit. Dried flowers, herbs and tar are some of the notes that add complexity through to the finish.

This is an excellent choice for readers who may have found the 2007 Barberas in general to be too big. A mid-weight finish laced with sweet herbs, spices and licorice rounds things out in style.

The 2000 is a beautifully open, expressive Monprivato yet it appears to have enough density to age well for another decade-plus. The wine is delicious in bottle, but it is even better in magnum.

Freisa is an indigenous red grape, but there aren’t too many producers making serious wines from this variety any more. Mascarello is one of them. The Toetto shows off pretty red fruit, herbs, anise and flowers in a somewhat austere, restrained style. Deceptively medium in body, the wine shows terrific balance and plenty of textural brilliance. This is a compelling, if eccentric, wine from Mascarello. It will be superb at the table, and at nearly six years of age, shows no signs of fading whatsoever. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2015.

The irony is that by the time the wines start showing well they are long gone from the market or have appreciated dramatically in price.

Still, this shows quite a bit of density for the vintage. Ideally the Bricco is best opened well in advance to allow some of more rustic notes to blow off. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2013.

The 2006 is an explosive Monprivato endowed with layers of ripe red fruit backed up by firm, muscular tannins that speak with great eloquence. I expect the 2006 to go through a period of stubbornness - as it often does - but it should begin to show well at around age ten or so. From time to time, the wine shows glimpses of its nobility. The 2006 is shaping up to be a profound Monprivato. The only thing it needs is time. This is a fabulous effort from Mascarello. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2036. 

Proprietor Mauro Mascarello makes some of the most compelling, traditional wines in Piedmont. Mascarello’s signature Barolo, Monprivato, rarely shows well when young, yet it has a proven ability to transform magically in the bottle, something I have witnessed first-hand with more vintages than I can remember. The irony is that by the time the wines start showing well they are long gone from the market or have appreciated dramatically in price.

852,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2006 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno is a decidedly more important and interesting wine in this vintage. A fresh, vibrant hue leads to glorious dark fruit, menthol, spices and sweet medicinal herbs. Elements of classic austerity and ripeness play off each other as this structured, powerful Barolo opens up in the glass. This is a fabulous vintage for the Santo Stefano di Perno. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2031.

Sweet and perfumed to the core, the Villero shows lovely balance and purity in an up-front, slightly fragile style. Floral and spice notes linger on the refined finish. Mascarello bought this parcel in 1985 and replanted it in 1988, making this a relatively young vineyard in the Mascarello stable. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2026.

This is a rather opulent, almost port-like Barolo from Mascarello that captures all of the best qualities of the 2003 harvest while avoiding the hard tannins that plague so many wines. A blast of iron, tar and smoke informs the long, virile finish. This will be a fascinating Barolo to follow over the coming years and decades. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2033.

855,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"The 1989 Barolo Monprivato is staggering in its freshly cut roses, spices and hard candy. The wine possesses a level of inner sweetness and kaleidoscopic, multi-dimensional aromas that give me chills. This remarkably fresh, vibrant and chiseled Barolo continues to develop beautifully in the glass, revealing shade after shade of nuance. Mascarello's 1989 Barolo Monprivato remains one of the greatest wines ever made - from any region. Although the 1989 Monprivato is almost certain to last beyond my drinking window, it would be a shame to miss it while the fruit is so gorgeous. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.  

I have had the privilege to drink - not just taste - Mascarello's 1989 and 1990 Barolo Monprivato on several occasions this year, but that notwithstanding I was frankly not at all prepared for the sensational showing of these bottles from proprietor Mauro Mascarello's cellar. In one of the greatest weeks of my wine-drinking life when I tasted nearly all of the icon wines from the 1989 and 1990 vintages in Piedmont, these two Monprivatos stood out for their sheer profoundness. Mauro Mascarello was among the early proponents of single-vineyard Barolos. His Barolo Monprivato, which boasts an impressive track record dating back to 1971, is one of the finest wines of the traditional school. The Monprivato vineyard, a near-monopole, often yields wines that achieve a brilliant combination of elegance and power matched by few sites in the world.

856,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Nebbiolo,"Mascarello’s 2007 Langhe Nebbiolo is a supremely elegant offering redolent of perfumed red fruit. As it sits in the glass the wine shows lovely inner perfume in its roses, spices and raspberries. Sweet, ripe tannins make the Langhe Nebbiolo utterly delicious and approachable today, but with some bottle age it might very well develop further complexity. Mascarello fans will not want to miss this suave, finessed Langhe Nebbiolo. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2017.  

Proprietor Mauro Mascarello has turned out two very pretty 2005 Barolos, but did not bottle his Villero as he waited until after the rains to pick the fruit and by that time the quality in the vineyard had been compromised. There is also no Ca d’Morissio in 2005, as that juice was blended into the Monprivato. Although Mascarello is best known for his Barolos, his entry-level wines also merit serious consideration. Although Mascarello’s Barberas aren’t as well-priced as they once were, they are capable of delivering tons of class and elegance.

857,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Dolcetto d'Alba Bricco,"The 2007 Dolcetto d’Alba Bricco is a very pretty wine laced with perfumed red fruit. Most of the intensity is up front as the wine’s persistence drops of a bit on the mid-palate. The Bricco remains a very traditional style of Dolcetto, but in 2007 the sheer vibrancy of the fruit helps balance some of the more rustic elements that are present. This is a very beautiful vintage for the Bricco. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2013.

858,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Codana,"The 2006 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Codana is yet another brilliant wine from Mauro Mascarello. In this vintage the Codana achieves remarkable purity while remaining light on its feet. Ripe red berries, minerals, flowers and herbs linger on the refined, elegant finish that emerges from a wine that transcends variety. Although delicious today, readers who enjoy more tertiary notes will want to cellar the Codana for a few years. This roughly 1,000 bottle lot spends 12-14 months in a single medium-size 7 hectoliter barrel. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2016.

859,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2006 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Santo Stefano di Perno is quite possibly the finest vintage of this wine I have ever tasted. All of the elements come together beautifully. The wine opens up to reveal bright ripe fruit and expressive aromatics, showing superb clarity and detail. The slightly herbal qualities the Santo Stefano typically presents are beautifully balanced in this vintage. The 2006 Barbera Santo Stefano is another wine Mascarello fans will not want to miss.

860,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"The 2005 Barolo Monprivato is a very pretty, harmonious wine endowed with tons of purity in its fruit. All of the telltale aromas and flavors of Monprivato are there – geraniums, roses, spices and flowers – but backed up by quite a bit of heft and body as well. Today, the 2005 Monprivato is quite tannic, but it should come around with a few more years in bottle. In some ways, the 2005 reminds me of the 1999, another vintage in which the Ca d’Morissio was not produced. Monprivato is typically one of the hardest wines to accurately assess when young, and only time will tell what heights it ultimately reaches. For now, the future certainly seems bright. This is a mysterious, seductive Monprivato that will be fascinating to follow. Mascarello was especially selective with his Monprivato and only bottled about 50% of his production. He also blended in the juice kept separately for the Ca d’Morissio, which in this vintage is about 20% of the final blend as opposed to the more typical 10% in vintages when the Ca d’Morissio is produced. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2035.

861,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2005 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno reveals a pretty core of dark fruit, herbs and spices in a medium-bodied style. This round, harmonious Barolo should drink nicely with a minimum of cellaring. The integrity of the fruit and the inner perfume of the 2005 are gorgeous and in this vintage the wine shows none of the angular edges that are present at times. With air, the wine gains volume and comes together very nicely. This is a gorgeous and very pure Santo Stefano from Mauro Mascarello. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022.

This silky, accessible Barbera is likely to offer its best drinking over the near term. Sweet roses, tar and licorice linger on the close. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2013.

864,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Langhe Nebbiolo,"The 2006 Langhe Nebbiolo would make a great house Nebbiolo or wine by the glass in a restaurant as it has tons of varietal character woven into its medium-bodied frame. This poor-man’s (or woman’s) Barolo offers up tons of floral tones, red fruits, spices and licorice. The tannins are firm, but the heat of the vintage has yielded just enough fleshiness to provide balance. The finish is long, clean and absent some of the awkward notes that young wines often show at this property. Mascarello’s Langhe Nebbiolo is a gem in 2006. This is a spectacular effort at its level. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2016.  

Mauro Mascarello is one of the most fascinating personalities in Piedmont. He is also arguably the longest-tenured active winemaker in the Langhe, having been directly responsible for all aspects of production at his family’s estate since 1970, which makes him an invaluable resource on the traditions of the region. Today’s younger generation of high-end producers speak with great reverence about Mascarello and even more so about his father Gepin who was a legend in these parts. Mascarello was an internationally-renowned producer decades before today’s big names were even making wines under their own labels. Twenty years ago, Mascarello’s signature Barolo Monprivato was one of the most expensive Barolos on the market. Then the new-age style became dominant during the 1990s and the estate languished in perception, but not quality. In recent times Mascarello has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity which is long overdue. Prices have gone up, but the Barolo Monprivato in particular remains a steal relative to other world-class wines. Monprivato is one of the handful of Italian wines than can hold its own with the best being made anywhere in the world.

The structure and minerality of this Monforte vineyard is quite present as this powerful Dolcetto reveals its intense and muscular personality. As is often the case with Mascarello’s Dolcettos the traditional style is borderline with what most tasters (me included) are likely to find acceptable in terms of the wines aromatics. This Dolcetto needs some serious aeration to clean up, yet the richness of fruit is remarkable. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2012.

This round, sweet Barolo is extremely primary at this stage, with tons of dense fruit that almost cover the wine’s tannins completely. Subtle overtones of roses and tar develop in the glass, rounding out this majestic wine. Monprivato is one of the world’s very finest values in collectible, age-worthy wine, and the 2004 is another classic in the making. I was blown away by this wine’s sheer balance and harmony, both of which are remarkable considering the wine’s age. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2034.

871,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barbera d'Alba Codana,"The 2005 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Codana, from an old-vine plot adjacent to Monprivato, is even better. While some vintages of this wine can come across as very concentrated, the 2005 remains light on its feet. Rich layers of sweet dark fruit, licorice, menthol and minerals gradually come forth in a compelling display of sublime elegance. Readers who appreciate traditionally made Barberas won’t want to miss this outstanding effort. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2015. 

Mauro Mascarello is one of the few producers who prefers his 2003 Barolos to his 2001s as he finds they have more power and intensity while also maintaining finesse and a sense of classicism. The wines certainly have more power, but I am not sure I would agree they have more finesse. In any event, his 2003 Barolos are among the best of the vintage, in particular the Santo Stefano di Perno and Monprivato. I also tasted the 2003 Ca’ d’ Morissio from barrel a few months ago, and it is shaping up to be a remarkably rich wine very much in keeping with the style of the vintage. Mascarello hasn’t decided when he will release the 2001 Ca’ d’ Morissio, but it, too, is promising, as is his entire range of 2004 Barolos.

875,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Monprivato,"The 2003 Barolo Monprivato is made in an atypically big, powerful style loaded with ripe fruit supported by plenty of structure. It boasts an enticing palate presence and a uniquely intense personality. The classic Monprivato notes of ripe cherries, roses, minerals, flowers and herbs are present, but they don’t have the clarity and precision of the finest vintages. In 2003 Mascarello was more severe than normal in his green harvesting of the vineyard as he wanted to lighten the load on his plants to reduce their stress. He was also helped considerably by the compact, moisture-retentive soils. Readers who prefer more classically-styled versions of Monprivato may want to revisit the 1999 and 2001 although Mascarello told me he prefers the 2003 to the 2001.

876,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Santo Stefano,"Mascarello’s 2003 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno is superb. It presents gorgeous aromatics along with the essence of dried roses, dried cherries, herbs and spices. Made in a surprisingly seamless style, it possesses an open, forthcoming personality, outstanding length and polished tannins. The big question is whether it will shut down in the bottle. For now it remains sweet, harmonius and impossible to resist, even if it doesn’t give the impression of being especially long-lived. Anticipated maturity:  2007-2018.

877,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Villero,"The 2003 Barolo Villero isn’t as convincing. It presents a lovely core of sweet fruit and the typical mentholated, balsamic notes that are typical of this site, yet it comes across as somewhat awkward in its aromatics and disjointed in structure. With air it improved, but only to a limited extent. The higher sand content in the vineyard vis ? vis Santo Stefano and Monprivato seems to have penalized the wine in the scorching 2003 vintage.

878,Giuseppe Mascarello e Figlio,Barolo Santo Stefano,"What a pleasure it is to taste the 2001 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno, easily the best in recent years. It displays a highly aromatic nose, with notes of roses, raspberries, minerals and menthol, with a feminine, yet structured personality and less of the green note this wine can show, which in the past I have found to be distracting. This bottling can be a bit hard when first opened, but a little air will help to smooth the edges. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2021.

It offers everything one could want from a Barolo, starting with a huge, brooding balsamic nose of spices, cocoa, leather, menthol and tar. This superbly structured wine is massive, with waves of ripe dark fruit that coat the palate, potent tannins and an exquisitely long finish. Made from a special parcel within the heart of the Monprivato cru planted with the Michet clone, this Riserva is only released in top vintages. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2027.

Boasting a dark ruby hue, it shows a captivating, well-delineated nose that suggests roses, violets and minerals, along with densely packed layers of primary black cherry fruit on a big, structured frame of notable length, with much purity and imposing tannins. Though not especially expressive today, my sense is that this wine is holding back much of its potential and it will be a fascinating effort to follow, although readers will have to be especially patient with this wine. Sadly, within just a few vintages it has become priced in the stratosphere. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2031.

The varietal notes are there, but this is anything but a fruit-driven, up-front type of Dolcetto and it will require a bit of time to come around.

The integrity of the fruit and the inner perfume of the 2005 are gorgeous and in this vintage the wine shows none of the angular edges that are present at times. With air, the wine gains volume and comes together very nicely. This is a gorgeous and very pure Santo Stefano from Mauro Mascarello. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022.  

Proprietor Mauro Mascarello has turned out two very pretty 2005 Barolos, but did not bottle his Villero as he waited until after the rains to pick the fruit and by that time the quality in the vineyard had been compromised.

907,Henschke,Langhe Nebbiolo,"The 2006 Langhe Nebbiolo would make a great house Nebbiolo or wine by the glass in a restaurant as it has tons of varietal character woven into its medium-bodied frame. This poor-man’s (or woman’s) Barolo offers up tons of floral tones, red fruits, spices and licorice. The tannins are firm, but the heat of the vintage has yielded just enough fleshiness to provide balance. The finish is long, clean and absent some of the awkward notes that young wines often show at this property. Mascarello’s Langhe Nebbiolo is a gem in 2006. This is a spectacular effort at its level. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2016.  

Mauro Mascarello is one of the most fascinating personalities in Piedmont. He is also arguably the longest-tenured active winemaker in the Langhe, having been directly responsible for all aspects of production at his family’s estate since 1970, which makes him an invaluable resource on the traditions of the region. Today’s younger generation of high-end producers speak with great reverence about Mascarello and even more so about his father Gepin who was a legend in these parts. Mascarello was an internationally-renowned producer decades before today’s big names were even making wines under their own labels. Twenty years ago, Mascarello’s signature Barolo Monprivato was one of the most expensive Barolos on the market. Then the new-age style became dominant during the 1990s and the estate languished in perception, but not quality. In recent times Mascarello has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity which is long overdue. Prices have gone up, but the Barolo Monprivato in particular remains a steal relative to other world-class wines. Monprivato is one of the handful of Italian wines than can hold its own with the best being made anywhere in the world.

908,Henschke,Dolcetto d'Alba Santo Stefano di Perno,"The 2006 Dolcetto d’Alba Santo Stefano di Perno reveals notable depth in its ripe dark fruit. The structure and minerality of this Monforte vineyard is quite present as this powerful Dolcetto reveals its intense and muscular personality. As is often the case with Mascarello’s Dolcettos the traditional style is borderline with what most tasters (me included) are likely to find acceptable in terms of the wines aromatics. This Dolcetto needs some serious aeration to clean up, yet the richness of fruit is remarkable. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2012.

909,Henschke,Dolcetto d'Alba Bricco,"The 2006 Dolcetto d’Alba Bricco is a rustic, old style wine loaded with ripe dark fruit supported by sturdy tannins. The wine shows some awkward herbal notes at the outset that slightly fade with aeration. As gorgeous as the fruit is here, this is a style that is likely to appeal most to lovers of traditionally made wines. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2012.

910,Henschke,Barolo Monprivato,"Mascarello’s 2004 Barolo Monprivato is an explosive wine with an almost Pinot-like expression of purity in its fruit. This round, sweet Barolo is extremely primary at this stage, with tons of dense fruit that almost cover the wine’s tannins completely. Subtle overtones of roses and tar develop in the glass, rounding out this majestic wine. Monprivato is one of the world’s very finest values in collectible, age-worthy wine, and the 2004 is another classic in the making. I was blown away by this wine’s sheer balance and harmony, both of which are remarkable considering the wine’s age. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2034.

911,Henschke,Barolo Santo Stefano,"The 2004 Barolo Santo Stefano di Perno is a dramatic, large-scaled wine packed with vibrant dark fruit, menthol, violets and sweet spices. Fresh floral notes linger on the long finish. This bottling can sometimes come across as somewhat rustic, but in 2004 it is remarkably elegant, all while preserving the qualities of this unique Monforte vineyard. The Santo Stefano di Perno is the under the radar gem in this lineup. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2024.

This refined medium-bodied wine provides an excellent contrast to Mascarello’s other Barbera, the decidedly muscular Codana. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2014.

914,Henschke,Barbera d'Alba Codana,"The 2005 Barbera d’Alba Superiore Codana, from an old-vine plot adjacent to Monprivato, is even better. While some vintages of this wine can come across as very concentrated, the 2005 remains light on its feet. Rich layers of sweet dark fruit, licorice, menthol and minerals gradually come forth in a compelling display of sublime elegance. Readers who appreciate traditionally made Barberas won’t want to miss this outstanding effort. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2015. 

Mauro Mascarello is one of the few producers who prefers his 2003 Barolos to his 2001s as he finds they have more power and intensity while also maintaining finesse and a sense of classicism. The wines certainly have more power, but I am not sure I would agree they have more finesse. In any event, his 2003 Barolos are among the best of the vintage, in particular the Santo Stefano di Perno and Monprivato. I also tasted the 2003 Ca’ d’ Morissio from barrel a few months ago, and it is shaping up to be a remarkably rich wine very much in keeping with the style of the vintage. Mascarello hasn’t decided when he will release the 2001 Ca’ d’ Morissio, but it, too, is promising, as is his entire range of 2004 Barolos.

Made in a powerful, rustic style, this full-bodied, structured Dolcetto is loaded with personality much of which comes from the older vines that are planted in these limestone-rich soils.

918,Henschke,Barolo Monprivato,"The 2003 Barolo Monprivato is made in an atypically big, powerful style loaded with ripe fruit supported by plenty of structure. It boasts an enticing palate presence and a uniquely intense personality. The classic Monprivato notes of ripe cherries, roses, minerals, flowers and herbs are present, but they don’t have the clarity and precision of the finest vintages. In 2003 Mascarello was more severe than normal in his green harvesting of the vineyard as he wanted to lighten the load on his plants to reduce their stress. He was also helped considerably by the compact, moisture-retentive soils. Readers who prefer more classically-styled versions of Monprivato may want to revisit the 1999 and 2001 although Mascarello told me he prefers the 2003 to the 2001.

Made in a surprisingly seamless style, it possesses an open, forthcoming personality, outstanding length and polished tannins. The big question is whether it will shut down in the bottle. For now it remains sweet, harmonius and impossible to resist, even if it doesn’t give the impression of being especially long-lived. Anticipated maturity:  2007-2018.

It presents a lovely core of sweet fruit and the typical mentholated, balsamic notes that are typical of this site, yet it comes across as somewhat awkward in its aromatics and disjointed in structure. With air it improved, but only to a limited extent. The higher sand content in the vineyard vis ? vis Santo Stefano and Monprivato seems to have penalized the wine in the scorching 2003 vintage.

It displays a highly aromatic nose, with notes of roses, raspberries, minerals and menthol, with a feminine, yet structured personality and less of the green note this wine can show, which in the past I have found to be distracting.

It offers everything one could want from a Barolo, starting with a huge, brooding balsamic nose of spices, cocoa, leather, menthol and tar. This superbly structured wine is massive, with waves of ripe dark fruit that coat the palate, potent tannins and an exquisitely long finish. Made from a special parcel within the heart of the Monprivato cru planted with the Michet clone, this Riserva is only released in top vintages. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2027.

924,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"The 1996 Barolo Riserva Ca’ d’Morissio, with more classic aromas and flavors, is the perfect foil to the 1997. Boasting a dark ruby hue, it shows a captivating, well-delineated nose that suggests roses, violets and minerals, along with densely packed layers of primary black cherry fruit on a big, structured frame of notable length, with much purity and imposing tannins. Though not especially expressive today, my sense is that this wine is holding back much of its potential and it will be a fascinating effort to follow, although readers will have to be especially patient with this wine. Sadly, within just a few vintages it has become priced in the stratosphere. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2031.

925,Henschke,Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz,"Hung deli meat, star anise and blackberry adorn the nose of the 2017 Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz. Discerning this is akin to peering over the counter at an Italian deli, with meat, cheeses and garlic hanging from the ceiling: it's enveloping and welcome. On the palate, the wine is bright and concentrated, with layers of salted blueberry, licorice and staunch (yet fine) tannins. It has flexibility and pliability, but it also has shape and form—all of it encased in a medium-bodied shell. It is savory and lean above all else, with bacon fat adorning all edges.",,RP 97
926,Henschke,Hill of Roses Shiraz,"“This wine is produced from a selection of low-yielding, dry-grown Shiraz vines from the Hill of Grace vineyard that are, at present, too young to be considered for inclusion in the Hill of Grace vintages.” Matured in French oak for nearly two years, the 2017 Hill of Roses Shiraz has vitality and electricity and life. It has all of the Eden Valley hallmarks: blueberry and bacon fat, fresh acidity, licorice, allspice and deli meat. The wine is savory in the mouth, but it feels plush—despite being only medium-bodied. An interesting wine of amalgams, it is certainly incredibly distinct, and with length of flavor that plows across the palate. Looking at it beside the Hill of Grace, it is evident that the old vines bring with them a certain gravitas of tannin, which, at present, the Hill of Roses does not possess. Having said that, the two wines are different sides of the same coin, and each will have its fans.",,RP 97
927,Henschke,The Wheelwright Single Vineyard Shiraz,"Planted in 1968, in the cooler part of the Mount Lofty Ranges in Eden Valley, this is the third release of this wine. Lean, spicy and with brilliant concentration (sans weight), the 2017 The Wheelwright Single Vineyard Shiraz is an elegant wine of line and poise. The finish rounds out into a bruised plum, purple jube, licorice character that adds a hint of sweetness to the affair. This may sound a little left of center, but there’s a (good) sweet balsamic roast beetroot character in the very center of the wine that brings on an earthy, sweet, bloody character. All very Eden in terms of fruit, but very distinct too. As it opens up, it becomes more vibrant—fresher, even. Yet it remains slightly sinewy and savory at its heart.",,RP 97
928,Henschke,Julius Riesling,"More concentrated and taut than the Peggy's Hill bottling, Henschke's 2021 Julius Riesling is almost unfruity at first whiff, with scents limited to hints of crushed stone and chalk dust. Those slowly yield to notes of mixed citrus, including grapefruit, lemon and lime. It's medium-bodied on the palate and tightly focused, built around a narrow beam of acidity that drives through the long, lively finish. It can be enjoyed now—preferably with some fresh-shucked Coffin Bay oysters—or cellared up to a decade (and probably longer).",,RP 97
929,Henschke,Peggy's Hill Riesling,"The 2021 Peggy's Hill Riesling boasts almost briny scents of green apple, underripe peach, lime zest and baby powder. It's medium-bodied, linear and focused without being lean and finishes long, with echoes of green apple and citrus. I expect it will be at its best young, but this nicely balanced Riesling under screw cap will likely still be drinkable in a decade.",,RP 97
930,Henschke,Henry's Seven,"Henschke's entry-level red in the US market is the 2020 Henry's Seven, a blend of 72% Shiraz (co-fermented with 3% Viognier), 13% Grenache and 12% Mataro (Mourvèdre). It sees just 5% new oak, with the balance aged in older hogsheads. Hints of asphalt and black olives appear on the nose, backed by blueberries, raspberries and black cherries, while the medium to full-bodied palate is supple, marked by soft, almost-powdery tannins and a long, mouthwatering finish.",,RP 97
931,Henschke,Tappa Pass Shiraz,"Aged in 16% new French oak, the 2019 Tappa Pass Shiraz reveals little of the oak influence on the nose, which features notes of allspice, mint, sage, black cherries and blackberries, perhaps just a touch of mocha. It's complex and savory, medium to full-bodied and sturdily constructed on the palate, with firm but ripe tannins, ample concentration and a long, dusty finish. In short, it's a terrific wine, just a step behind the super 2018 in opulence but maybe a step ahead in terms of longevity.",,RP 97
932,Henschke,Marble Angel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,"Subtle whiffs of mint and cedar emerge on the nose of the 2019 Marble Angel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, joined by ample cassis fruit. Richly concentrated and tannic, yet ripe, this full-bodied, long-finishing and cellar-worthy effort would put many international competitors in the same price bracket to shame. It's a terrific, single-vineyard wine for the price of entry to Napa Valley, which ought to give nightmares to many investors there. Now if American consumers can just be convinced to give this a chance...",,RP 97
933,Henschke,Johann's Garden,"An 80-20 blend of Grenache and Mataro, the 2019 Johann's Garden is noticeably lighter in hue than the other reds in this year's Henschke lineup. That's not a bad thing, as the wine still boasts ample concentration and distinct Grenache-ness. Hints of resinous herbs, like rosemary and bay, appear on the nose, alongside hints of strawberries and red raspberries, while the medium to full-bodied palate is framed by soft tannins and built around a core of bright acids that linger mouthwateringly on the finish.",,RP 97
934,Henschke,Keyneton Euphonium,"The 2017 Keyneton Euphonium is 62% Shiraz, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and 3% Merlot, aged in 19% new oak hogsheads (85% French, 15% American). The oak imparts a bit of smokiness and mocha overtones to the nose, but this is a largely fruit-driven effort, with ripe cherries, boysenberries and blackberries touched with hints of eucalyptus and sage. It's medium to full-bodied, smooth and streamlined on the palate, with a soft dusting of tannins and lingering berry and herb flavors on the finish.",,RP 97
935,Henschke,Innes Vineyard Pinot Gris,"Tank-fermented and held on the lees for six months, the 2020 Innes Vineyard Pinot Gris comes from a vineyard in the Adelaide Hills. Beautifully aromatic for a Pinot Gris, it offers up scents of ripe pears and melons, plus floral notions and a hint of dried spices. Medium to full-bodied, it's silky in feel and round and expansive on the palate without being fat or oily, with delicate hints of apple skin on the finish, which adds focus and grip. I'd drink this young, while the plump, ripe fruit is still ascendant.",,RP 97
936,Henschke,Croft Chardonnay,"Although marked by accents of toasted grain and nuts, the focus of the excellent 2019 Croft Chardonnay is on the wonderfully pristine white peach and pineapple fruit. Medium to full-bodied and joyfully generous on the palate, it's focused and streamlined at the same time, flowing easily into a long, citrus-inflected and silken finish. The best Croft Chardonnay to date?",,RP 97
937,Henschke,Henry's Seven,"A blend of 74% Shiraz, 16% Grenache, 8% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier (the Shiraz and Viognier are co-fermented), aged mostly in used barrels, the 2019 Henry's Seven hints at asphalt and black olive tapenade, set against a backdrop of blueberry and brambly blackberry fruit. Medium to full-bodied, it's creamy-slippery in texture—no doubt helped along by the Viognier inclusion—supple and easy to drink, with a juicy, lip-smacking finish and almost unnoticeable tannin. Drink it young and fresh.",,RP 97
938,Henschke,Giles Pinot Noir,"Subtle whiffs of campfire flit past on the cranberry-raspberry nose of Henschke's 2019 Giles Pinot Noir. Medium-bodied and silky on the palate, with a delicate wash of soft tannins on the finish, it's a classy, easy-drinking Pinot Noir to drink over the next next 5–7 years.",,RP 97
939,Henschke,Tappa Pass Shiraz,"The 2018 Tappa Pass Shiraz blends fruit from Eden Valley and Barossa Valley, then ages it in 20% new French oak hogsheads, with the balance aged in used oak. Vanilla notes and dried spices add extra complexity to the dark berry fruit on the nose, while this creamy, full-bodied wine expands on the palate, delivering waves of lush blueberry and blackberry fruit balanced by savory overtones of tapenade and grilled beef. Those elements all come to a harmonious crescendo on the long, velvety finish. This is the sort of Barossa wine that's thrilling to drink in its exuberant youth but will still be going strong a decade or more hence.",,RP 97
940,Henschke,Marble Angel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,"Grown in red clay over limestone in Light Pass, the 2018 Marble Angel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon aged 18 months in 10% new French oak, with the balance being used hogsheads. Inky purple in hue, it offers hints of pencil shavings on the nose, but the focus is on the deep, intense cassis fruit. Full-bodied and richly textured, it's generous and structured at the same time, with hints of dark chocolate adding to the sensation of richness on the long, velvety finish. I may be biased, but I would rather drink this than most California Cabernets I've tried at this price point.",,RP 97
941,Henschke,Abbott's Prayer,"A blend of 57% Merlot and 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2018 Abbott's Prayer reflects the outstanding vintage, offering a luscious blend of mocha, black cherries, cassis, tobacco and vanilla on the nose, which seems to lack the green notes that marked previous vintages. Medium to full-bodied, it balances the round, mid-palate generosity of the Merlot with the length and tannic structure of the Cabernet, finishing long and dusty. While approachable now, it should be better in five years and will probably peak around five years after that.",,RP 97
942,Henschke,Johann's Garden,"The 2018 Johann's Garden is a blend of 77% Grenache, 19% Mataro and 4% Shiraz, all matured in older French hogsheads. Scents of cola and spice meet plums and black cherries, but this is a bit reserved on the nose, with the explosiveness left to the full-bodied, lush palate. Generous and mouth-filling and marked by supple tannins and ripe fruit, it's plump and round, with a softly dusty finish. Gulpable now, it should add some spice nuances over the next several years as the fruit gently fades.",,RP 97
943,Henschke,Louis Semillon,"Almost entirely tank-fermented and aged on the lees (5% goes into used barriques), the 2018 Louis Semillon offers up scents of fresh oranges and limes, with hints of fig and custard. It's medium-bodied and silky-textured on the palate, with more richness than most Aussie Semillons but less than most Barossa versions. Compared to the laser-focused 2017, this vintage is easy to drink, yet it still boasts a refreshing, zesty finish. It shows plenty of charm now and should drink well for at least another few years, although I don't see it having the long-term prospects of the 2017.",,RP 97
944,Henschke,Noble Gewurztraminer,"Even the honeyed notes of botrytis can't completely conceal the bold lychee fruit of Henschke's 2017 Noble Gewurztraminer. It even retains some delicate florals on the nose, while the palate is loaded with sweet pear and melon fruit, which glides into a long, refreshing finish. At 11% alcohol and 99 grams per liter of residual sugar, it's very drinkable—not a sugar monster, but a wine that would work with not-too-sweet fruit desserts or salty cheeses.",,RP 97
945,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"Henschke's 2016 Hill of Grace Shiraz is locked up tight behind a stubborn wall of firm tannins. Scents of pencil shavings, mocha, bay leaf, mixed berries and plums appear on the nose, while the full-bodied palate starts off broad, expansive and creamy, then draws to a chewy, drying finish. There's ample concentration, length, complexity and a definitive track record of aging, so put this version away for several years while waiting for it to emerge and show its true glory. If you absolutely must drink it now, decanting for a couple of hours helps soften the tannins and brings the fruit forward.",,RP 97
946,Henschke,Hill of Roses Shiraz,"Essentially a young-vine Hill of Grace (although the grapevines were 28 years old at the time), the 2016 Hill of Roses Shiraz comes from a single block replanted using selections from the original vines. Hints of menthol and bay leaf mark the nose, imparting an inimitable Eden Valley note to the dark berry aromas. It's full-bodied and concentrated on the palate, tannic but ripe, finishing long and velvety. It may be longer lived than the Tappa Pass—and is much more limited in production—but I might rather have three or four bottles of the Tappa Pass.",,RP 97
947,Henschke,Stone Jar Tempranillo,"The 2018 Stone Jar Tempranillo aged exclusively in older hogsheads, so there's little oak influence. There is a subtle dustiness on the nose, like fresh-picked blackberries and red plums that have had raindrops hit the earth, splash up on them and subsequently dry, leaving a delicate web of fine soil particles behind. Medium to full-bodied, this is streamlined and direct on the palate, focused to a tart, driving point on the lengthy finish, without a great deal of textural tannins.",,RP 89
948,Henschke,Giles Pinot Noir,"Hints of celery seed accent the cherry and cranberry aromas on the nose of the 2018 Giles Pinot Noir. It's medium-bodied, with fine, silky tannins and a sense of lightness on the fast-fading finish. It's easy to drink now, but it should develop a bit more complexity and interest over the next few years.",,RP 89
949,Henschke,Tilly's Vineyard,"An assemblage of five varieties grown in the Adelaide Hills and Eden Valley, the 2018 Tilly's Vineyard features scents of lime zest, crushed stone and underripe pears. It's an easy-drinking, medium-bodied blend based on Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, with bits of Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling rounding it out. Drink it young.",,RP 89
950,Henschke,Tappa Pass Shiraz,"The 2017 Tappa Pass Shiraz is a blend of fruit from two grower vineyards: one in Tappa Pass and one in Light Pass, with vines up to 70 years old. Black olives and blackberries mingle easily on the nose, joined by hints of star anise, mint and cedar. As usual at Henschke, the oak takes a back seat, amounting to only about 20% new hogsheads, while the fruit shines. On the full-bodied palate, the dance of fruity and savory continues, with hints of grilled meat and blueberries complemented by ample spice, supple tannins and a gentle swirl of caramel on the lingering finish.",,RP 89
951,Henschke,Johann's Garden,"The 2017 Johann's Garden is a blend of 76% Grenache, 18% Mataro and 6% Shiraz, aged in used French oak hogsheads. Sandalwood, cherries and exotic spices appear on the nose of this full-bodied, opulent offering. It's creamy and mouthfilling without seeming heavy or overdone, remaining fresh and lively through the lingering finish that picks up hints of star anise and ground pepper.",,RP 89
952,Henschke,Louis Semillon,"The crisp, lemony 2017 Louis Semillon weighs in at only 11.5% alcohol, pretty typical for this bottling, which is meant to be age-worthy. Like Hunter Valley versions, it can be consumed young, with oysters or other shellfish, or aged 10 years or so to attain greater dimension. Scents of citrus zest and crushed stone appear on the nose, while the light-bodied palate is streamlined and refreshing, with a long, mouthwatering finish.",,RP 89
953,Henschke,Henry's Seven,"The 2017 Henry's Seven is 73% Shiraz, 17% Grenache, 5% Mataro and 5% Viognier. While it lacks the depth and richness of Henscke's top-level bottlings, it's wonderfully complex, with notes of menthol, juniper, thyme and allspice accenting blueberries and blackberries. Medium to full-bodied and silky in texture, it can be drunk now or cellared 5-8 years.",,RP 89
954,Henschke,Croft Chardonnay,"Delicate scents of toasted grain and white peaches mark the nose of the 2017 Croft Chardonnay. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, tart and even a bit austere, with notes of underripe peaches and green plums that turn citrusy on the long finish. While not very generous at the moment, it's tightly wound and should blossom in another year or two, then drink well for 6-7 years.",,RP 89
955,Henschke,Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz,"The 2016 Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz is steeped in complexity, with aromas ranging from camphor, bay leaf and sage to smoke and grilled beef and from blueberries and blackberries to plums laced with spice. Full-bodied, rich and intense, it's ripe and velvety textured, with a long, licorice-tinged finish and dusty tannins that bode well for the cellar. From vines planted in 1912, I suspect this will come close to the quality of the Hill of Grace at a fraction of the price. Tasted again the following day from the open bottle, this was even better, seamless, flowing and harmonious in the mouth.",,RP 89
956,Henschke,The Wheelwright Single Vineyard Shiraz,"From a vineyard planted in 1968, Henschke's 2016 The Wheelwright Single Vineyard Shiraz offers up classic Eden Valley notes of bay leaves, crushed stone, blueberries and hints of cracked pepper. Full-bodied, intense and concentrated, this is a stellar addition to the Henschke lineup, being bottled on its own only since 2015. The tannins are supple, the mouthfeel round and rich and the finish spicy-savory and long. There is a touch of warmth on the finish, but it's as much pepper or licorice as alcohol. A terrific wine, I suspect this will drink well for more than a decade.",,RP 89
957,Henschke,Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon,"The family's flagship Cabernet is the 2016 Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon. As usual, the oak regime incorporates a reasonable 20% new French hogsheads, lending a discreet edge of pencil shavings to the scents of pipe tobacco, menthol and cassis. It's medium to full-bodied but exquisitely balanced so as to appear nearly weightless on the palate, buoyed by ripe, plush tannins that turn softly dusty on the lingering finish. It's another excellent vintage for what is arguably Eden Valley's top Cabernet Sauvignon.",,RP 89
958,Henschke,Keyneton Euphonium,"A blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, the 2016 Keyneton Euphonium beautifully marries the mint and herb of the Bordeaux varieties with the plumminess and spice of the Shiraz. Hints of mint, tea and violets accent dark, plummy fruit, then finish with savory overtones of black olive. It's full-bodied and supple, ready to drink now or age 15 or more years.",,RP 89
959,Henschke,Abbott's Prayer,"A blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon and 24% Merlot grown in the Adelaide Hills, the 2016 Abbott's Prayer matured in 20% new French oak hogsheads for 18 months prior to blending and bottling. It has some classic cooler-climate Cabernet characters, including hints of capsicum and mint layered atop a base of cassis and black cherries, while the oak lends a cedary edge. It's medium to full-bodied but nicely streamlined and proportioned, not bulky or broad in the slightest, with a fine structure wrought by silky tannins.",,RP 89
960,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"I briefly thought about just cutting and pasting the review of the 2014 into this space for the 2015 Hill of Grace Shiraz, but on further reflection, there are some differences between them—and isn't that one of the reasons we love wine? Scents of smoked meat and mocha accent notes of black olives and blackberries, joined by subtle notions of resinous herbs, while the full-bodied palate comes across as slightly weightier, richer and more velvety in texture than the 2014. Not as elegant perhaps, but more concentrated and powerful on the long, long finish.",,RP 89
961,Henschke,Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz,"Camphor, pitch and raspberry appear on the nose of Henschke's 2015 Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz. It's a muscular, full-bodied expression of Eden Valley Shiraz, with notes of black olives and cassis on the palate and enough tannins to give this amply-endowed wine a savory edge. There's a lovely sense of tension between the fruity and savory elements and a long, velvety finish, making this one of the stars of the lineup—and a relative bargain compared to the Hill of Grace. The dry-farmed vineyard was planted in 1912 and has been bottled as a single-vineyard wine since 1952, making it one of the oldest such wines in Australia.",,RP 89
962,Henschke,Hill of Roses Shiraz,"""Young vines"" (just under 30 years of age) propagated from the Hill of Grace Vineyard go into this wine, grown in the Post Office Block of the original HoG vineyard. The 2015 Hill of Roses Shiraz was aged in 55% new French hogsheads, and the oak shows a bit on the nose, adding mocha and charred-meat notes to the vibrant blueberry and raspberry fruit, sage and bay leaf herbals. Full-bodied and richly textured on the palate, with a long, velvety finish, it's more limited in production than the Mount Edelstone Shiraz, but I wouldn't call it better at this point.",,RP 89
963,Henschke,Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon,"Svelte and refined, the 2015 Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon is wonderfully composed and complete. Hints of cedar, earth and tobacco appear on the nose alongside cassis and black cherries, while the medium to full-bodied palate is streamlined yet generous and richly textured, leading into a lingering, silky finish. Elegant and concentrated, it should drink well for over a decade.",,RP 89
964,Henschke,The Alan Pinot Noir,"Essentially a reserve selection from the family's Lenswood vineyard, Henschke's 2015 The Alan Pinot Noir is one of the best Pinot Noirs I've tried from the Adelaide Hills. Hints of smoke accent deep notes of black cherries and freshly tilled loam on the nose, while the medium-bodied palate is richly textured and opulent without being overworked or super ripe, finishing with a refreshing burst of red berry acidity. Complex, elegant and complete, it should drink well for at least another 5-8 years.",,RP 89
965,Henschke,Keyneton Euphonium,"With its blend of 66% Shiraz, 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, the 2015 Keyneton Euphonium is a more structured Syrah-based blend than the Henry's Seven. Less generous young, it promises at least a decade of cellaring potential. Hints of cedar and green-edged tobacco appear on the nose, alongside scents of cassis, mocha and pristine earthy notes of clean compost. It's medium to full-bodied, with tannins that are both silky and firm providing focus and length.",,RP 89
966,Henschke,Marble Angel Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,"Planted in red clay over limestone in the Light Pass subregion, Henschke's 2015 Marble Angel Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon offers up notions of mint and capsicum layered over cassis, easily concealing the 20% new oak on the nose. The full-bodied palate reveals hints of cedar and dry, woody tannins that actually help restrain the runaway cassis train and keep it on the tracks to a long, slightly warm finish. Despite the dusty tannins, I'd opt for drinking it over the next 5 years or so, while the fruit is still plush and vibrant.",,RP 89
967,Henschke,The Rose Grower Nebbiolo,"There are few Nebbiolos in Australia and even fewer good ones. Henschke's 2015 The Rose Grower Nebbiolo (which includes a splash of Barbera) is appropriately rusty in color at the rim but clear ruby at its heart. Aged in only used oak, the aromas are spot on—marrying floral notes with cherry fruit and hints of black tea, while the medium to full-bodied palate is round and supple, telegraphing sunshine and ripeness well in excess of most Barolos. There seems no need or reason to age this beyond the present day, as it makes for a pretty satisfying drink, even without the classic Nebbiolo tannins.",,RP 89
968,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"From vines planted in the 1860s, the 2014 Hill of Grace Shiraz raises the bar beyond the heights reached by the stellar 2015 Mount Edelstone, exceeding it in elegance and (forgive me) grace. It's one of those rare wines that manages to be mouthfilling and voluminous while seeming weightless. Airy notions of mixed spices, woodsmoke and herbs swirl above a mélange of red and black berries and a deep base of black olives and mocha, finishing with enormous silkiness and length.",,RP 89
969,Henschke,Johanne Ida Selma Blanc de Noir MD,"A blend that includes wines from 1997–2016, Henschke's NV Johanne Ida Selma Blanc de Noir MD is all Pinot Noir from the Lenswood portion of the Adelaide Hills. A lovely straw color in the glass, with a fine, long-lasting bead, it boasts scents of fresh apples, green hay and citrus. Light to medium-bodied, with a gentle, creamy mousse, it finishes on tart, green-apple flavors and a slightly chalky note. With only 11.5% alcohol and a low dosage (5.5 grams per liter), it's a terrific palate refresher, apéritif or oyster accompaniment.",,RP 89
970,Henschke,Julius Riesling,"Sourced from vines planted in the 1960s, the 2017 Julius Riesling features scents of lime blossoms and green apples. It's medium-bodied and seems soft and round upon first glance, with hints of peach leading a lovely integration of fruit and acidity. While already charming, it appears to have the backbone to support a decade or so of aging.",,RP 89
971,Henschke,Innes Vineyard Pinot Gris,"One of the best (the best?) Pinot Gris I can remember tasting from Australia, the 2016 Innes Vineyard Pinot Gris is made in stainless steel but kept on the lees and stirred to help enrich the mid-palate. It's medium-bodied, with a gentle, silky feel and even a flourish of tannins on the long finish. Spiced poached pear, melon and yellow plum provide plenty of aromatic and flavor interest in this complex, intriguing white.",,RP 89
972,Henschke,Henry's Seven,"A bit more aromatic and vibrant than the 2015, the 2016 Henry's Seven is a blend of 66% Shiraz, 15% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre, and 9% Viognier. Medium-bodied, plump and mouthwatering, it showcases attractive notes of cherries and stone fruit, with just a touch of savory black olive. It should drink well for at least 6-7 years.",,RP 89
973,Henschke,Tilly's Vineyard,"Five different white varieties went into the 2016 Tilly's Vineyard. It's 50% Sauvignon Blanc (unusually high for this wine), 15% Sémillon, 14% Pinot Gris, 13% Riesling, and 8% Chardonnay, sourced from the Adelaide Hills and Eden Valley. Beeswax, lime and gooseberry notes lead the way, followed by a light to medium-bodied wine with a plump mid-palate. It's subtle and understated, finishing with hints of gentle citrus.",,RP 89
974,Henschke,Tappa Pass Shiraz,"The 2015 Tappa Pass Shiraz features aromas of smoke, cracked pepper, blueberries and plums. It's full-bodied, creamy-textured and plush, yet it never seems heavy, instead showing wonderfully expressive fruit and complex spice notes on the long, supple finish. It's a really fine Barossa Shiraz.",,RP 89
975,Henschke,Abbott's Prayer,"There was no 2014 made, so the 2015 Abbott's Prayer will be released soon. It's a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon and 43% Merlot from the family's Lenswood Vineyard in the Adelaide Hills, matured in 30% new French oak hogsheads. There's a leafy, capsicum edge, but that's balanced by bold cassis fruit in this medium to full-bodied wine. It's plump and silky in the mouth, with a long, appropriately dry finish. It should drink well for over a decade.",,RP 89
976,Henschke,Henry's Seven,"The 2015 Henry's Seven is a blend of 65% Shiraz, 20% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Viognier (co-fermented with the Shiraz), matured in older French oak hogsheads. It's medium to full-bodied, with scents of green peppercorns, stone fruit and cherries. Open and fruit-driven, it acquires a slightly savory, dusty note on the finish.",,RP 89
977,Henschke,Keyneton Euphonium,"Predominantly Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon (there's some Merlot and Cabernet Franc as well), the 2014 Keyneton Euphonium is leafy and fresh, with raspberry and cassis fruit dusted with dried herbs and spices. It's medium-bodied but ripe and creamy-textured on the palate, showing great balance between intensity and detail, then slowly fading on the long, slightly dusty finish.",,RP 89
978,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"Another terrific HoG, the 2013 Hill of Grace Shiraz is dense and rich, thickly concentrated and full-bodied yet not heavy or bulky in the slightest. It's kept lively through a fine dusting of savory spices—allspice, clove, star anise—and juicy, mouthwatering acids, which support the blackberry and plum fruit. The finish, framed by softly dusty and supple tannins, suggests a wine capable of at least two decades of positive evolution.",,RP 89
979,Henschke,Cyril Henschke,"The blend of the 2013 Cyril Henschke is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's understandably less fragrant than the 2012, but perhaps it's more powerful, with intense, pungent cassis on the nose. Full-bodied and chunkier than the 2012 on the palate, it's still on the elegant side for Cabernet, with a supple, persistent finish.",,RP 89
980,Henschke,Abbott's Prayer,"There was no 2014 made, so the 2013 Abbott's Prayer is still the current release. A blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon and 41% Merlot from the Adelaide Hills, it has some dusty, dried-herb notes on the nose but avoids any overt greenness. Plump black cherries and cassis feature on the medium to full-bodied palate, showing a bit of grainy texture on the long finish.",,RP 89
981,Henschke,Cyril Henschke,"The 2012 Cyril Henschke is 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot. The nose boasts lovely floral and herbal notes, seamlessly interwoven with deep cassis fruit. Medium to full-bodied, it's firm but generous, with really fine structure and silky tannins on the finish. It's approachable now, albeit very young, and should drink well through at least 2035.",,RP 89
982,Henschke,Hill of Roses Shiraz,"Drawn from 21-year-old vines propagated by cuttings from selected Hill of Grace vines, the 2012 Hill of Roses Shiraz aged in 71% new French oak hogsheads for 18 months. It exhibits great spice-and-herb complexity, ranging from clove and allspice to cola, sage and green peppercorn, then folds in hickory smoke and blackberry flavors. It's full-bodied but not as rich or dense as the Hill of Grace, and with its long, silky finish, it should mature earlier.",,RP 89
983,Henschke,Croft Chardonnay,"Subtle notes of pencil shavings accent peaches and pears in Henscke's 2016 Croft Chardonnay. This generous, medium to full-bodied wine boasts bold flavors and plenty of richness and texture. It should drink well for the next 5 years.",,RP 89
984,Henschke,Julius Riesling,"The 2016 Julius Riesling leaps from the glass with beautiful lime blossom, lemon curd and white grapefruit notes with suggestions of jasmine, lanolin and hay. Light-bodied, pure, clean, refreshing and very dry, it has an almost electric intensity and very long, mineral-laced finish.",,RP 89
985,Henschke,Johann's Garden,"A blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Mataro and 5% Shiraz, the 2015 Johann's Garden sports a pale to medium garnet-purple color and nose of kirsch, aniseed, mulberries and potpourri with touches of Chinese five spice, black loam and Sichuan pepper. Medium to full-bodied, plush and full-on sexy on the palate, it delivers layers of soft, exotically laced fruit with plenty of lingering spice notes on the finish.",,RP 89
986,Henschke,Louis Semillon,"Opening with lemongrass, fennel, white pepper and chalk dust notes, the 2015 Louis Semillon is dry, light-bodied and tightly wound at this youthful stage, offering thirst-quenching elegance for now with a promise of loads more to come with 7-10 years cellaring.",,RP 89
987,Henschke,Shiraz Mount Edelstone Keyneton Vineyard,"Medium to deep garnet in color with a purple rim, the 2014 Shiraz Mount Edelstone Keyneton Vineyard exudes a nose that is simply beguiling, exuding earth, meat and mineral layers over a core of black berries and mulberries, plus hints of mincemeat, sautéed herbs and menthol. Medium to full-bodied with a firm backbone of chewy tannins and marked freshness, it is savory, broody and taut at this youthful juncture, finishing with lingering fried herbs notes. I love the singularity and overall complexity of this wine, but there is a pronounced herbal character and hardness that robs it of a higher rating.",,RP 89
988,Henschke,Giles Pinot Noir,"Pale ruby in color with a hint of purple, the 2014 Giles Pinot Noir has a wonderfully fragrant nose of crushed red cherries, black raspberries and violets with hints of cinnamon stick, dried Provence herbs and underbrush. Light to medium-bodied with bags of elegance and yet exciting intensity, it has a solid backbone of grainy tannins and lively acid, finishing long and perfumed.",,RP 89
989,Henschke,Hill of Grace Shiraz,"Medium to deep garnet colored, the 2012 Hill of Grace Shiraz is a little reticent on the nose to begin, opening out to a somewhat paradoxically tantalizing Black Forest cake, beef dripping, fertile loam and tree bark nose with hints of black pepper, Marmite, bay leaves, eucalyptus, licorice and baker’s chocolate.

Its dense, opaque ruby/purple color is followed by a big, smoky perfume of roasted meats, creme de cassis, blackberries, licorice, and barbecue spices as well as a fabulously long finish that lasts nearly a minute. This flamboyant, exotic, full-bodied, rich, unctuous 100% Shiraz was aged in 80% new American and French oak for 18 months. Drink it over the next 12-15 years. This cuvee often possesses impressive aging potential as evidenced by the 1990 (rated 94) and 1979 (rated 92), both drunk in July, 2005.

No wimpish effort, it is a layered Shiraz that builds incrementally across the palate, offering expansive blackberry, earthy, peppery notes with smoke and wood in the background.

While it was machine as well as hand harvested, that should not have anything to do with its austere, Bordeaux-like character. The flavors are undeveloped but impressive, the tannin is high, and the finish is slightly astringent and clipped. I have some concerns about the wine’s balance. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2012?

1199,Domaine de Montille,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières, which sees 10% new oak and will stay in tanks until February/March, has a modest nose, just a little smudged at first, but it opens up with beeswax and jasmine scents, if less minerality than I was expecting. The palate is well balanced, quite powerful and rich with good depth in the mouth, but I am missing that sense of tension and certainly the minerality on the finish. It is a “pleasant” almost ""benign"" Perrières, but it just does not possess that essence of the vineyard and at least at this early juncture, is surpassed by de Montille’s other white ‘13s. ",,RP ?
1200,Domaine de Montille,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves,"The 2013 Beaune Grèves 1er Cru has a broody, more tertiary bouquet compared to the les Sizies 2013, with a light leafy element coming through. The palate is clean and fresh with angular tannins, lean but fresh with a tapered cranberry and strawberry finish that has commendable backbone if not the persistence or peacock’s tail of flavor. This has more substance than the Les Sizies '13, although I have tasted better vintages in the past. ",,RP ?
1201,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Pezerolles,"The 2013 Pommard 1er Cru les Pezerolles, which was hit by hail and 100% destemmed, is rather muted and subdued on the nose after the Volnay ‘13s. The palate is medium-bodied with rather hard tannins and missing some fruit in the middle (what you might describe as a “doughnut” Burgundy). It gathers a little momentum toward the austere finish, but I would drink this over the next four to six years. ",,RP ?
1202,Domaine de Montille,Beaune 1er Cru Les Sizies,"The 2013 Beaune 1er Cru les Sizies, which was hit by hail, though not as bad 2014, was entirely destemmed due to the denuded quantity of fruit. It has a light red berry and cranberry bouquet while the palate is easy-drinking with light tannin, no sign of any rot and a decent tensile finish. Drink this over the next three to five years. ",,RP ?
1203,Domaine de Montille,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts 2011 has a beautiful perfumed, floral bouquet that opens immediately with bright red cherries, fresh strawberry, minerals and just a tincture of burnt toast. The palate is medium-bodied, perhaps just a little green around the edges, structured and masculine with an aloof finish that will need time to mellow. This feels like it has some stem addition and while that influences the wine now, it will be assimilated and transform into intriguing secondary flavors down the line. ",,RP ?
1204,Domaine de Montille,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The aromatics on the Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Caillerets 2011 is more austere than Anne-Claude Leflaive’s Clavoillon, but it is beautifully defined with wet limestone and sea cave scents that with aeration become very intense. The palate is crisp and taut with very fine tension. It just loses a little intensity toward the finish, but it possesses a surfeit of freshness and precision. This was one of the best white 2011s Burgundy wines that I tasted during an intensive week of peer group tasting.",,RP ?
1205,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens ‘11 has an attractive bouquet with vivacious red cherries, bergamot and cold wet stones. The palate is well defined with a crisp line of acidity. This is a lighter style of Rugiens from de Montille and though it just lacks a little persistence, it does offer fine balance and poise. ",,RP ?
1206,Domaine de Montille,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Corton Clos du Roi has an intense bouquet that is well defined with more fruit intensity than Vougeraie’s own Clos du Roi, displaying lifted black cherry, wild strawberry and chlorophyll scents. The palate is smooth and harmonious on the entry, although the oak here is quite conspicuous and tends to erase not just the hard edges, but some of the personality on the austere finish. Perhaps I would afford this Clos du Roi another 3-4 years in bottle to see if it can muster something more eloquent to say. ",,RP ?
1207,Domaine de Montille,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Domaine de Montille’s 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru has a similar nose to Louis Latour’s: austere and minerally, more tertiary in style than Louis Jadot’s Corton-Charlemagne with a light marine influence that becomes more prominent with aeration. The palate is quite effervescent on the entry with orange zest and lime, although it does not quite possess the complexity of the previous two wines and feels smudged on the finish. ",,RP ?
1208,Domaine de Montille,Volnay 1er Cru Les Mitans,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Volnay 1er Cru les Mitans 2011 feels a little musty on the nose, which is missing some harmony and focus and becomes ever-increasingly raw with time. The palate is masculine with dry tannins; the fruit not quite in sync with the structure of the wine and the finish feels rather disjointed and diffuse. I will seek to re-taste this Volnay. ",,RP ?
1209,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Grands Epenots,"The 2004 Pommard 1er Cru Les Grands Epenots has a light, licorice-scented bouquet that shows no signs of any greenness, if anything is quite opulent in character for a Pommard. The palate is chewy and dense on the entry. This is a voluminous and powerful Pommard but it does not have any sense of finesse and seems like a flat-footed tap-dancer on the finish. Peculiar! Again – a case of good wine de-railed by year of birth?",,RP ?
1210,Domaine de Montille,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Le Cailleret,"The 2005 Puligny-Montrachet Les Caillerets has a very smooth, creamy bouquet that would have mass appeal, although blind I would not necessarily pin it down to one of the finest vineyards in Puligny. The palate is well-balanced; the new oak quite conspicuous considering it has a few years in bottle, with almond and coconut defining the lush finish. This is a delicious Chardonnay more than a great Puligny. Drink now-2018. ",,RP ?
1211,Domaine de Montille,"Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts ""Cuvée Christiane""","There are 7½ barrels of the 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts Christiane this year from 0.48 hectares of vines tucked into La Tache. Ever since this prize plot came into Etienne de Montille’s hands, he has felt that it creates a different Pinot Noir to the regular Malconsorts and I can vouch for that myself having compared the two cuvees blind over three of four vintages in Paris, back in 2009. They both undergo identical vinification. It has a wonderful, exuberant bouquet laden with vivacious orange sorbet, strawberry preserve, minerals and incense like fireworks across the sky. The palate is medium-bodied, streamlined with very fine lithe tannins accompanied by a fine silver thread of acidity. It feels more compact, perhaps denser and more imposing than the regular Malconsorts and delivers a long persistent finish to complete a swarthy Malconsorts Christiane that is suffused with grandiloquence. Tempted?

I was interested to learn that when Hubert de Montille inherited his father’s vines in 1947, it consisted of just three hectares. Over the years he built up both his family’s holdings and his reputation from his base in Volnay, not far from Michel Lafarge, while running a successful law firm in Dijon. During the 1990s he gradually handed over the running to his son Etienne, who was working in the financial sector and his daughter Alix, married to Jean-Marc Roulot. It was during Etienne’s tenure at Credit Foncier that he was charged with running Chateau de Puligny-Montrachet. That was probably when I first met him, somewhere around 1998, the first time accompanied by his father. Etienne is not a man to take things easy. He established a negociant business in 2003 (Les Deux Montille) that is based in the old Bouchard Pere cellars on the outskirts of Meursault, converted the vineyard to organic viticulture in 1995 and then biodynamic in 2005. Though certified by Ecocert in 2012 he has always been less dogmatic about it than others practitioners. The biggest development in recent years is the acquisition of the mouth-watering Thomas-Moillard holdings in 2005 in conjunction with Domaine Dujac and outside investors. If I am to be honest, the rapid changes have made it difficult to keep up with the changes, not that anyone is protesting against improvements. I guess it is just a case of keeping pace with Etienne! Today they tend just over 20 hectares of vine of which three-quarters are either premier or grand cru. See also Chateau du Puligny-Montrachet. As usual, there is a clutch of excellent wines here, each appearing to articulate the vagaries of each terroir with style.

1212,Domaine de Montille,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts, which comes from the Thomas-Moillard two parcels on the upper and lower reaches of the vineyard that were purchased in 2005. It is 100% whole cluster pressed and raised in 50% new oak. It has a beguiling bouquet with brambly red and black fruit, wild mushroom and sous-bois aromas that are intense and yet charming even at this early stage. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins. Plenty of bay leaf tinged black fruit, super mineralite and a precise, focused finish that lingers long in the mouth. This is just superb.

1213,Domaine de Montille,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanee Les Malconsorts graces the palate with finesse and nuance to spare. Hints of graphite, spices and crushed rocks add complexity to the fruit, but this is ultimately a wine of texture above all else. Silky tannins frame the highly expressive finesse. The 2009 Malconsorts has really come together over the last six months. It is more immediate than the 2010 tasted alongside it, but in a perfect world a well-stocked cellar would have both vintages. This is a flat-out great Malconsorts from Etienne de Montille. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.  

Etienne de Montille’s 2009 reds have developed beautifully since I last tasted them about six months ago. De Montille was among the very first growers to harvest in 2009. At the outset de Montille’s 2009s were a bit awkward, but today they have come together better than I expected.

Bright red fruit, hard candy and fresh flowers are some of the many nuances that take shape in the glass. The 2009 reveals considerable aromatic lift and a seamless personality that is totally inviting. De Montille used 67% whole clusters, but their influence is quite marked in the wine.

It possesses marvelous depth in a weightless style informed from the use of 100% whole clusters.  The 2009 can be enjoyed today or cellared. It is arguably the 2009 that has come together the most over the last six months. This is a great effort from Etienne de Montille. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2029+.

Although I like the wine’s frank immediacy, I also think it will age gracefully. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.

The 2010 Christiane flows from the glass with a rich, exotic tapestry of dazzling fruit, black cherries, violets, licorice, spices and hard candy. White flowers add lift and sweet perfume on the breathtakingly beautiful finish. The integration of fruit and structure is virtually seamless. In other words, everything is in perfect balance. Readers who can find the Christiane should not hesitate. It is without question one of the wines of the vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2035-2055. 

Etienne de Montille describes 2010 as similar to 2002, but with less acidity. He adds that 2010 is a vintage where the end result was less apparent early on than years like 2006 and 2007, where the wines turned out pretty much as originally expected. According to de Montille, there isn’t a huge difference between the Cote de Beaune and Cote de Nuits. That may be true here, but in my view it is not the case in a broader context. De Montille tends to pick early, and his wines in the cellar also finish their malos fairly quickly, which is how things played out in 2010 as well. Most of the 2010s had been racked into steel at the time of my visit, except for the Corton Clos du Roi, Clos Vougeot, Vosne-Romanee Malconsorts, Vosne-Romanee Malconsorts Christiane, which I tasted from barrel. The harvest started on September 20 and ran through the 28th. Some wines were lightly chaptalized. De Montille planned to start bottling in January 2012 with a handful of the entry-level bottlings. I also tasted the 2009s. I will have more to say in our April issue, but for now I can share that the wines have developed beautifully. De Montille’s decision to pick early certainly seems to have paid off.

1226,Domaine de Montille,Volnay 1er Cru Les Taillepieds,"The 2010 Volnay Taillepieds comes across as a blend of the Mitans and the Champans. It has the aromatic lift of the former and the textural richness of the later. This is a beautifully balanced wine loaded with sheer class and pedigree. Red berries, spices and flowers are some of the many nuances that are woven into the finish. The Taillepieds was made with 100% whole clusters, but unlike the Mitans, the whole clusters seem to mark this wine to a slightly lesser degree, at least today. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2035. 

Etienne de Montille describes 2010 as similar to 2002, but with less acidity. He adds that 2010 is a vintage where the end result was less apparent early on than years like 2006 and 2007, where the wines turned out pretty much as originally expected. According to de Montille, there isn’t a huge difference between the Cote de Beaune and Cote de Nuits. That may be true here, but in my view it is not the case in a broader context. De Montille tends to pick early, and his wines in the cellar also finish their malos fairly quickly, which is how things played out in 2010 as well.

1227,Domaine de Montille,Volnay 1er Cru Les Champans,"The 2010 Volnay Champans presents a deeper, richer and more powerful expression of fruit than the Mitans. It was also made with 100% destemmed fruit. Here the aromas and flavors are on the darker side of red, but it is more the wine’s muscle and textural plushness that distinguishes it. Sweet spices, red berries and licorice wrap around the plush finish. This is another great effort. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2035.

Etienne de Montille began harvesting on September 5 in 2009 in order to maintain as much freshness as possible. Natural alcohols came in between 12.7% and 13.2% slightly higher than the range de Montille prefers. My sense is that some of the entry-level 2009s could have used a touch more density, but the higher end wines are quite successful across the board. The 2009s were aged on their lees and were not racked until they were prepared for bottling, which began in September 2010, the first time de Montille had bottled 1er Crus before the following harvest. I tasted most of the 2009s from tank, where they were settling before bottling. De Montille did not plan to fine or filter any of the wines in tank.

1253,Domaine de Montille,Clos Vougeot,"High-toned aromas of maraschino, pistachio, and herbal extracts mingle with red currant and cherry on the nose and bright, firm palate of de Montille’s 2008 Clos Vougeot. As I work this around in my mouth, deeper notes of roasted red meat and crushed stone add depth, while a persistently enticing primary juiciness accompanies them into a long finish, helping to mitigate any sense of austerity. This ought to be worth following for 12-15 years.  

Etienne de Montille related having taken great pains in early September, 2008 to stave-off encroaching rot and promote ripeness, and felt that his rigorous leaf-pulling and crop-thinning – not to mention eventual triage – paid off sufficiently that he could vinify a substantial portion of the 2008 crop in his preferred manner, utilizing a high proportion of stems and whole clusters (100% in the case of this year’s grand crus and top premier crus). Those wines for which a point spread is indicated were all last tasted shortly before their early spring bottling as finished assemblages in tank – whence they had been racked at the end of 2009 because de Montille did not think their fruit density or lees quality would have supported longer barrel-elevage.

1254,Domaine de Montille,Volnay 1er Cru Les Taillepieds,"A strikingly marine and shrimp shell-tinged nose and palate with bright red currant and tart cherry fruit mark the de Montille 2008 Volnay Les Taillepieds, which allies white wine refreshment and minerality to intensely persistent fruit and a sort of turf-meets-surf finish that incorporates metaphorically dark, fungal forest floor shadings. Serving more for head-scratching than  head-turning, this intriguing expression of its great site nonetheless incorporates a subtly satiny texture thanks to its ultra-fine tannins, and in the course of the coming 12-15 years one can expect its incipient sensuality to rise to its level of fascinating complexity, and for it to serve adeptly at table.

Bright and finely-tannic, this lean though long Pezerolles delivers mouth-watering savor, but I would be inclined to plan on enjoying it over the next 6-8 years rather than anticipating long-term aging potential of the sort this bottling often exhibits.

1257,Domaine de Montille,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"The de Montille 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Thorey strikes me as a possible demonstration that the relatively bright light style in which this estate’s 2008s from the Cote de Beaune are rendered works less well when applied to Nuits-St.-Georges, as there is a certain rusticity of tannin showing through that might be covered over in a plusher or less transparent style of Pinot. That said, tart red fruits and a smoked meat and bouillon-like combination of carnal and prominently saline elements lend this Nuits stimulating, lip-smacking satisfaction. The tannins suggest elements of black tea and leather but are also simply slightly gum-numbing. I would want to reevaluate this in a few years before judging its potential for longer-term aging. (I unfortunately managed to miss-out on tasting de Montille’s 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux St.-Julien.)

There is a persistently drying astringency, although fresh cherry; subtle mushroom typical for this cru; and satisfying meatiness all add interest, and there is plenty of primary, tart juiciness to the finish. I would sin on the side of safety and plan on drinking this within the next 3-4 years.

Like its counterpart from the Sizies, this is a bit short on charm, but as it opens up, notes of game and forest floor convey intriguing complexity, and there is impressive length, incorporating a saliva-inducing salinity. This should prove quite adaptable over the next 5-7 years, though I would reassess it along the way before I’d considering holding it for a more extended period.  (While the Sizies benefited from around one-third stems and whole clusters, the Perrieres and Greves received double that.)

This has more intensity though less charm or refreshment than the corresponding Bourgogne. I would not plan on holding it for more than 4-5 years without benefiting from an interim reassessment.

Alive with energy and citric brightness yet also subtly creamy in texture and saturating the palate with liquid flowers and almond paste, it finishes with cut, clarity, refreshment, vibratory intensity, and a wealth of ineffable mineral nuances. This is both ultra-Caillerets and ultra-2007, and that is an impressive combination likely to resonate even a decade from now.

1263,Domaine de Montille,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The de Montille 2007 Corton-Charlemagne originates with 30 year old vines. (First estate-bottling of fruit originating in a neighboring portion of Corton Pougets that was grafted to Chardonnay from Pinot is not anticipated until the 2010 vintage.) Fresh apricot, grapefruit, tangerine, and hints of flowers and chalk dust in the nose carry onto a palate that manages to combine a surprising sense of viscosity, underlying mineral density, and subtle oiliness of texture with energy and refreshment. Bittersweet citrus rind adds to the sense of invigoration and grip in a palpably mineral finish that – perhaps not so surprising given its location on this grand cru massif – is almost red wine-like. ""We feel confident that the terroir serves for a good sense of minerals,"" comments de Montille, ""and now what we want to work on is the finesse, the lift."" That aptly sums up this impressively-concentrated, muscular and sinewy wine which should be well worth revisiting over the course of at least the next 8-10 years.

Licorice and apple pit lend a bitter-sweet cast to citrus and chalk foundations. Texturally rather spare, though with a touch of oiliness, this highly distinctive wild child of a white Burgundy finishes refreshingly, penetratingly, and with palpable mineral extract.

1265,Domaine de Montille,"Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts ""Cuvée Christiane""","As described in detail in issue 171 de Montille's 2006 Vosne-Romanee Les Malconsorts – Christianne comes from a share of that cru which is clearly visible on vineyard maps as if it had been cut-out from (or juts into) today's La Tache. With a more exotic, musky, and effusive floral perfume; similar plum and raspberry fruit and smokiness; and more palate-staining concentration than the corresponding ""regular"" Malconsorts, this also carries more structure and a more vivid if hard to pin down mineral dimension. The finish here is positively tidal in its expansiveness and relentlessness. Where the other bottling has more 2006-tyical virtues, this ""Christianne"" could easily be taken for a 2005. It will never give chase to its own 2005 counterpart, but it should prove immensely rewarding to follow for 12-15 years.

The de Montilles began picking in Volnay on September 25, followed by harvest of Pommard, Corton, and then Beaune. ""The sugar levels were around 13% potential alcohol and they kept going up,"" reports Etienne de Montille, ""but I didn't taste that much difference in the ripeness of the fruit."" Meanwhile, rot was threatening, and diligent triage as well as gentle, watchful vinification followed. But de Montille – who sees the vintage as combining aspects of 2000 and 2002 – persisted in his recent fidelity to whole-clusters and stem inclusion, with the top cuvees hovering around 50% vendange entier. Incidentally, de Montille had the estate's new cellars scrupulously searched and tested for signs of TCA; has installed a system for removing chlorine from the water used there; and (in a move that will affect an even larger portion of the production at Chateau de Puligny, which he directs) will be employing DIAM composite corks for the bottling of several (relatively) less-expensive wines, starting with vintage 2008.

Smoke- and floral-wreathed ripe purple plum and black raspberry lead to a palate of impressive richness, fine-grained tannins, and the mysterious depth of floral, mineral, and carnal elements that spell ""great Vosne."" Tasted last from barrel, this finishes with formidable length yet a sense of lift, and has excellent decade-or-more potential.

With these virtues comes a site-typical, palpable presence of tannin – fine-grained, though, and well woven into the wine's myriad mineral, carnal, and fruit strands.

It has plenty of structure, but less vivacity than the corresponding Taillepieds, and it will be interesting to see whether in the long run this proves to have more tannin that it needs to get where it's going over the next decade.

1271,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Pezerolles,"De Montille's 2006 Pommard Pezerolles features lightly-cooked plum and cherry allied to piquant nuttiness, pungent herbs, and roasted meat. Quite polished in texture, it manages to preserve a nice sense of transparency to nuance and of primary fruit juiciness in its finish. This certainly illustrates the typical generosity of its vintage, and should make lovely drinking over the next 4-6 years.

1272,Domaine de Montille,Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Saint-Juliens,"The 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux St.-Julien reflects a portion of the Thomas-Moillard estate whose fruit – since it is not premier cru-rated – Etienne de Montille had not yet determined in the 2005 vintage whether to bottle as domaine wine. The quality potential of this inauspiciously flat site immediately north of the town – site of a former monastery burned to the ground (according to legend, with its cloistered inhabitants) during the Cote d'Or's era of Protestantism – has been well-demonstrated over the years at Domaine Bocquenet. Sweet floral perfume, exotic spices, cherry preserves, cocoa powder, and hints of game make me realize the degree to which the flamboyant personality exhibited by this site chez Bocquenet may be more terroir-specific and less new barrel-influenced than I had realized. This de Montille rendition of Aux St.-Julien – which received neither new barrels nor any grape stems – is supple in palate presentation; preserves ample primary juiciness; and finishes with impressive length and invigorating salinity. A lip-smacker, it should reward visits over at least the next 4-5 years.

Chewy underlying tannins contribute to an impression of opacity here, and although the richness of fruit is undeniable, this doesn't display much refinement or vivacity and lift, at least on this occasion (shortly before bottling). It will be well worth revisiting in 2010 or 2011 to assess its likely subsequent evolution.

Dried cherry, rose hip, bitter-sweet floral perfume, and brown spices inhabit the nose and a pungently concentrated though fairly light-weight palate. This lacks the caressing texture of the dramatically differently flavored (fungal, mineral, carnal) Champans, but delivers a finish with somewhat more concentration and thrust. I would feel free to plan on following it for half a dozen years. I did not, incidentally, taste 2006 de Montille Volnays from La Carelle or Les Brouillards.

1276,Domaine de Montille,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves,"The de Montille 2006 Beaune Les Greves – informed by a southerly holding, near Teurons – is strikingly saline and alkaline already in its nose. Lightly-cooked cherry and meat stock on a palate of modest weight and relative refinement lead to a finish in which the wine's mineral dimensions seem to form a fine coating, but engender less invigoration or focus than is found in the Perrieres. There's no doubt, though, that this boasts riper fruit than that sibling, and de Montille says the grapes were ""a class better."" Time may further reveal the extent of that difference, but I would still plan to drink this wine within the next 4-6 years.

Floral perfume and scents of almond and cherry in the nose carry onto a quite delicate but creamily-textured palate, with hints of chalk and fruit pit bitterness adding contrast. Here is a modestly-endowed Pinot that can still serve as a poster child for the potential of 2006s to caress yet invigorate, and to be elegant without being slight.

Superbly concentrated, with creamy richness of texture and ripe peach and pear, wreathed with persistent inner-mouth flowers and tinged with citrus zest, this finishes with lift and refinement, as well as seductive, uncannily floral and nobly fungal persistence.

I would give this relatively austere cru several years in bottle before revisiting, and anticipate that it should evolve interestingly for at least 6-8.

The result is a totally different wine – and what a wine it is! Subtle brown spices, jasmine, orange rind mingle with moss, mineral nuance, and black fruits. Raw red meat and savory soy notes emerge on the palate. This displays singular textural refinement and elegance, purity and clarity of fruit, and an ineffable complexity of mineral nuances from stem to stern. The billowing richness of folds of black fruits set up a harmonious, almost Riesling-like call and response with minerals. Explore the extraordinary mysteries of this wine beginning in 5-7 years, though one could well imagine it being worth holding for more than twice that time.

The “regular” cuvee displays deep plum and black raspberry fruit, vivid spice (cumin, star anise, clove, white pepper), and lily flower. It comes to the palate amazingly dense, sultry, and precociously plush and creamy. The brightness of fruit and tactile intensity of spice linger with chalk and stone mineral suggestions in a finish of exceptional breadth and length.

Aromas of black raspberry, flowers and pungent, charred, dusty, ore-like and crushed stone mineral notes set a serious tone for what follows. Ripe, spiced black fruits and a soy-like savor team up for a palate of terrific richness, palpable density, abundant fine tannins, but also an enormous sense of energy and mouth-watering enticement. Wet stone, chalk, wood smoke, and charred meat make for a somber, low-toned side to this wine’s impressively persistent finish, but neither is there a lack of (black) fruit or savory salinity. This superbly concentrated and structured wine needs at least 10-12 years in the cellar, I suspect.

1285,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"The 2005 Pommard Rugiens delivers aromas of spice-tinged black cherry and raspberry with floral overtones. In the mouth this boasts a wonderful combination of creaminess of texture and chocolate low-toned richness, yet with energy and brightness of sweet fruit that carries in to a voluminous, luminous, savory, salty, meaty, chalky, resinous finish. The tannins are so fine and the mineral-carnal-floral layering with the fruit so clear that I am once again put more in mind of Volnay than Pommard.

Ripe spiced raspberry and cassis with soy-like savor make for an expansive rich display on the palate, where fine tannins are appropriately reined-in. This finishes with real thrust, and intense spice and mineral adjuncts to its ripe fruit. Rather than the clarity and elegance of the Grands Epenots, one gets a more opaque sense of richness here and a more obvious sense of density. This appellation – representing one of, if not the largest surface area of the estate – has been on a roll of late, and that is not by accident. De Montille reasserted control in 1999 over management of the vines and has been working to bring out a quality potential that need not take a back seat to Grands Epenots or Rugiens.

A mouthful of juicy, vanilla-tinged fresh cherry and raspberry fruit offers a creamy texture and leads to an effusive, refined finish that is hiding whatever tannic structure this wine (surely) possesses. It displays startling clarity of fresh fruit and is irresistible already, although I am sure one can safely sock some away for a decade.

Notes of cola and sassafras add aromatic allure. Smoky, gamey, forest floor nuances and distinctively stony minerality mark this wine’s mouth-coating palate and promising length.

This has the structure, formidable concentration and rich ripeness to suggest 6-8 years cellaring, but will it develop some nuance along the way?

A ripe but tart cherry-rhubarb fruit melange tinged by vanilla cream is also omnipresent, and there are aromatic hints of the mushrooms so typical for this site. Tannic, layered and concentrated like the Mitan, this however displays an emerging flattering creaminess of texture and an evocative clarity of finish fruit and spice which is as yet lacking from that rather seized-up wine.

(Part of the site was deeded to Sylvain Cathiard to free his lease on a portion of the Thomas-Moillard Malconsorts, and part went to the Seysses family of Domaine Dujac, who elected not to retain it after the 2005 vintage.) Vanilla tinged stewed rhubarb and roasted meats emerge from the glass, and the palate alternates between tart brightness and vanilla cream, meat and stony mineral steadily underlying the whole. The clearly major tannins are quite fine-grained and the finish is formidably persistent. This already impressively-endowed Pinot bids fair to become very interesting in 5-7 years.

1292,Domaine de Montille,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"From a new parcel, the de Montille 2005 Corton Clos du Roi smells of nutmeg-dusted red cherries and strawberries as well as flowers and game. Notes of resin and tobacco join in on the well-concentrated, dense palate, leading to a finish with persistent sweetness of fruit, but rather brooding gamey, darkly herbal notes, chalky mineral suggestions, and a touch of heat. It would be best to revisit this in two or three years to get a better idea of the direction it might be headed. (I was not able to taste the de Montille 2005 Corton Pougets.)

1293,Domaine de Montille,Volnay 1er Cru Carelle Sous La Chapelle,"From a tiny and little-known cru just north of Champans and downhill from the Clos de la Bousse d’Or, de Montille’s 2005 Volnay La Carelle Sous la Chapelle smells of nutmeg- and mace- tinged plum and red cherry; displays white wine-like delicacy and refinement but almost liqueur-like sweetness of fruit and subtle creaminess of texture on the palate; then takes a surprisingly stony, salty, iodine-like mineral turn in the finish. With a front end that tastes like it came from a confectioners and a finish as though it came from the stock pot of a poissonnerie, this displays a fascinating if split personality that should be revisited in a few years.

1294,Domaine de Montille,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Grandes Vignes,"The 2005 Nuits-St.-Georges Clos des Grands Vignes is from a monopole that lies up against Premeaux-Prissey and is thus the only premier cru vineyard anywhere along the Cote d’Or that is south of the route nationale. After acquiring this property as part of the Thomas-Moillard transaction, de Montille sold it to the Chateau de Puligny (which he directs) and whose team will vinify it in future. For marketing purposes therefore, the label design (though with the name “de Montille”) will be that of the Chateau de Puligny. Smoke, resin, and lightly-cooked black raspberry in the nose lead to a mouthful of nutmeg and cocoa-powder-dusted rich, dark, sweet fruit. Smooth and polished, with a lot of attractive baby fat covering its fine tannins, this finishes with irresistible generosity and juiciness, so that one should be tempted to start drinking it in a couple of years and (there being no track record) taste where it’s at.

1295,Domaine de Montille,Beaune 1er Cru Les Sizies,"From a sizeable but obscure cru (how very many in Beaune fit that description!) somewhat north of Vignes Franches, and which de Montille has bottled now for several years, the 2005 Beaune Sizies (assembled in tank) sports bright red currant fruit with faintly bitter and oily tangerine rind accents. Engagingly juicy and bright on the palate, it finishes with purity and vibrant persistence of red currant, grenadine, clove and orange zest. This tastes as though it would be white if it could, and de Montille intends it for immediate bottling and enjoyment.

1296,Domaine de Montille,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"In bottle for a month the de Montille 2005 Bourgogne offers as much or more then one could dream of from the humblest of appellations: bell-clear fresh black raspberry and cherry fruit; infectiously-juicy, ripe fresh fruit acidity yet incipient creaminess; and a long, subtly-satisfying finish, its pure fruit tinged with brown spices, cherry pit and chalk. This would have no problem standing comparison with top-flight village Volnay. “You can make something like this in Bourgogne once in five years,” says de Montille, “... maybe ten.”

1297,Domaine de Montille,Beaune 1er Cru Les Perrières,"From cask, de Montille’s 2005 Beaune Les Perrieres offers bright black cherry and rhubarb with sage, licorice, floral and vanillin adjuncts. (New wood enters at this point, but at only 10% there is certainly no obvious effect, indeed seldom in tasting the de Montille 2005s does one think “oak”.) This displays more fat and less sheer brightness than the Sizies (surprising given its rocky high-elevation above Cent Vignes and Marconnets), but similar pure persistence.

The tightly wound finish here is smoky, pungent and subtly bitter. In two or three years one would be able to glean a clearer notion of this wine’s ultimate personality.

A light ruby color displays considerable amber at the edge. The muted nose exhibits scents of animal fur, damp earth, mushrooms, and vague strawberry fruit. In the mouth, Montille has done the impossible - produced a high acid, tart, austere wine in a succulent, fleshy, opulently-styled vintage. This 1985 is going nowhere.",,RP 92

This rich, medium-bodied, broad, and beautifully elegant wine is packed with honeyed, stone flavors as well as a myriad of spices. It is well-concentrated, elegant, and begged to be consumed right from the cask. Anticipated maturity: now-2006.

Medium-bodied, subtle, and satin-textured, it is lush, beautifully balanced, and packed with magnificent layers of minerals, pears, and toast.

1303,Domaine de Montille,Pommard 1er Cru Les Rugiens,"I am in the minority on the subject of Montille's wines.  Just about every Burgundy wine writer extolls in glowing terms how these classic vins de garde are authoritatively rich, compelling examples of Pommard and Volnay.  Unfortunately, I believed them.  Having purchased, cellared, and opened many Montille Pommards and Volnays from the seventies and eighties, I note that far too many of this estate's wines turn out to be disappointingly thin, appallingly high in acidity, astringently tannic, and while enticingly perfumed, they lack fruit and balance.  Occasionally (1971 and 1978), the Pommard Les Rugiens can be excellent, but never has it been stunning.  Other vintages (1976, 1979, 1980, 1985, 1986, and 1988) have been disappointing.  I am not sure things have improved, as recent vintages of the wines (which are never meant to be flattering in their youth) have seemed abnormally hard and abrasive (i.e., 1990).  Perhaps the other writers are correct and miracles do occur after two decades of life in the bottle.
While I did not taste the 1993s from Montille, I did taste the 1992s since they have been in the bottle for nearly a year.  The three 1992s I tasted, the Volnay Les Champans (76), Volnay Les Taillepieds (74?), and Pommard Les Rugiens (76), could have been mistaken for 1993s given their hardness, severity, and lack of fruit.

I have done something with Montille's 1990s that I rarely do - give them the benefit of the doubt.  This domaine's style of winemaking produces such tannic, high acid, backward wines that a minimum of 10 years cellaring is required.

(First estate-bottling of fruit originating in a neighboring portion of Corton Pougets that was grafted to Chardonnay from Pinot is not anticipated until the 2010 vintage.) Fresh apricot, grapefruit, tangerine, and hints of flowers and chalk dust in the nose carry onto a palate that manages to combine a surprising sense of viscosity, underlying mineral density, and subtle oiliness of texture with energy and refreshment. Bittersweet citrus rind adds to the sense of invigoration and grip in a palpably mineral finish that – perhaps not so surprising given its location on this grand cru massif – is almost red wine-like. ""We feel confident that the terroir serves for a good sense of minerals,"" comments de Montille, ""and now what we want to work on is the finesse, the lift."" That aptly sums up this impressively-concentrated, muscular and sinewy wine which should be well worth revisiting over the course of at least the next 8-10 years.

With a more exotic, musky, and effusive floral perfume; similar plum and raspberry fruit and smokiness; and more palate-staining concentration than the corresponding ""regular"" Malconsorts, this also carries more structure and a more vivid if hard to pin down mineral dimension. The finish here is positively tidal in its expansiveness and relentlessness. Where the other bottling has more 2006-tyical virtues, this ""Christianne"" could easily be taken for a 2005. It will never give chase to its own 2005 counterpart, but it should prove immensely rewarding to follow for 12-15 years.

Suggestions of tobacco and iodine add to the concentrated bitter-sweetness of a long finish with a fine sense of transparency to mineral nuances.

With these virtues comes a site-typical, palpable presence of tannin – fine-grained, though, and well woven into the wine's myriad mineral, carnal, and fruit strands. And for all of its structure and underlying density, this displays levity and considerable sheer refreshment in its uplifting finish. It should be worth following for the better part of a decade.

Dark berries and burley tobacco, peat and iodine give this a metaphorically very dark hue. It has plenty of structure, but less vivacity than the corresponding Taillepieds, and it will be interesting to see whether in the long run this proves to have more tannin that it needs to get where it's going over the next decade. I would in any event grant it a 3-4 year head start.

1321,Kanonkop,Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Saint-Juliens,"The 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux St.-Julien reflects a portion of the Thomas-Moillard estate whose fruit – since it is not premier cru-rated – Etienne de Montille had not yet determined in the 2005 vintage whether to bottle as domaine wine. The quality potential of this inauspiciously flat site immediately north of the town – site of a former monastery burned to the ground (according to legend, with its cloistered inhabitants) during the Cote d'Or's era of Protestantism – has been well-demonstrated over the years at Domaine Bocquenet. Sweet floral perfume, exotic spices, cherry preserves, cocoa powder, and hints of game make me realize the degree to which the flamboyant personality exhibited by this site chez Bocquenet may be more terroir-specific and less new barrel-influenced than I had realized. This de Montille rendition of Aux St.-Julien – which received neither new barrels nor any grape stems – is supple in palate presentation; preserves ample primary juiciness; and finishes with impressive length and invigorating salinity. A lip-smacker, it should reward visits over at least the next 4-5 years.

Dried cherry, rose hip, bitter-sweet floral perfume, and brown spices inhabit the nose and a pungently concentrated though fairly light-weight palate. This lacks the caressing texture of the dramatically differently flavored (fungal, mineral, carnal) Champans, but delivers a finish with somewhat more concentration and thrust. I would feel free to plan on following it for half a dozen years. I did not, incidentally, taste 2006 de Montille Volnays from La Carelle or Les Brouillards.

Lightly-cooked cherry and meat stock on a palate of modest weight and relative refinement lead to a finish in which the wine's mineral dimensions seem to form a fine coating, but engender less invigoration or focus than is found in the Perrieres. There's no doubt, though, that this boasts riper fruit than that sibling, and de Montille says the grapes were ""a class better.""

Floral perfume and scents of almond and cherry in the nose carry onto a quite delicate but creamily-textured palate, with hints of chalk and fruit pit bitterness adding contrast.

The conclusion lingers with a soft tannic edge that makes this wine incredibly food friendly and will remain so for the next five years. Probably the most exciting aspect of the Kadette Pinotage is that I can see the overall quality increasing, as this specific vintage marks the highest ever score for this bottling.",,RP 88
1335,Kanonkop,Kadette Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opening with an enthusiastic nose, the 2018 Kadette Cabernet Sauvignon has a fresh-fruited frame with aromas of blackberry, plum and cassis. Medium-bodied, the wine displays balance, with structured tannins on the back end and is laced with a subtle flavor of black tea before ending with a soft plummy note over the delicate finish, delivering well for the price. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better value.",,RP 88
1336,Kanonkop,Kadette Cape Blend,"A blend of 37% Pinotage, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, the 2018 Kadette Cape Blend begins with juicy red and black fruit essence over dusty purple flowers with plum skin, blackberry and hints of spice on the nose. Medium to full-bodied, the wine is open and expressive in the mouth with a balanced structure and fruit that is more red-berried, with plum and cherry essence. Ending with a lingering finish and lifting tannins, this represents a delightful wine that delivers well for the price. Give it a try.",,RP 88
1337,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with 17% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot, the 2017 Paul Sauer offers a juicy, red-fruited nose with heady floral aromas and oak tones of cinnamon, vanilla and sweet cedar. Medium to full-bodied, flavors of red plum skin and dark cherry juice cover the palate with rosewater elements before gripping tannins expresses on the tongue. The wine lingers with a richness and robustness with vibrant, juicy flavors of currant and cassis, ending with a long, succulent finish. This shares many of the same similarities in style with its 2015 bottling and should age just as gracefully.",,RP 88
1338,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage,"Opening with dark cherry aromas, touches of black and red spice and a subtle hint of tar, the 2017 Kadette Pinotage is open-knit in the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the wine is straightforward on the palate and shows untamed tannins over the drying finish that needs food to balance out.",,RP 88
1339,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"A blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc, the dark ruby colored 2016 Paul Sauer offers aromas of caramel, black raspberry, plum and chocolate-covered cherries with hints of earth and leather in the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the palate shows more red fruit-dominated flavors of cassis, redcurrant and juicy black cherry with the perfumed oak expressions of vanilla, cinnamon and cardamom. The wine is balanced and has an open approachability in youth but can age for more than a decade. The wine ends with a a red-berry and cherry lift on the lingering finish. It's a lovely wine, but it's certainly the lightest of the bottlings from the last five years.",,RP 88
1340,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"Displaying a dark ruby core with purple and red hints on the rim, the 2018 Pinotage Stellenbosch opens with a nose of sweet, confected plums, black raspberry, mocha and hints of sweet oak spice. Medium to full-bodied, the wine displays sweet fruit on the palate with a generous helping of 80% new French oak. It ends with sappy plums and black cherry skin flavors that give way to tight tannins that linger on the long finish. There are plenty of winemaking practices happening with the expression that creates an enjoyable experience for the drinker.",,RP 88
1341,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage Rosé,"A barrel sample, the 2019 Kadette Pinotage Rosé has a pale salmon color with a fresh nose of ripe strawberries. The palate is simple without much depth or complexity, though it does have a touch of spice and tannin on the short, simple finish. If you're going to drink Pinotage rosé, drink it as young and as cold as possible.",,RP 88
1342,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage Rosé,"On the nose, the 2018 Kadette Pinotage Rosé begins with soft red flowers with hints of watermelon and strawberry tones. The wine falls in on itself and the 14% alcohol shows a little hotter than it should. There is no oak to speak of on the palate. This is a simple wine with a hot, simple finish. I recommend chilling it as much as possible.",,RP 88
1343,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"Immediately impressive upfront, the nose of the 2017 Black Label Pinotage is open and expressive. The opaque core has deep purple edges, and the fruit is concentrated with the oak. The dense and chewy fruit expresses the full array of blue, black and dark red tones—dark plum, blackberry, black cherry with hints of blueberry fill the  nose of the glass. On the palate, the fruit has a depth and breadth that is complex and gives pleasure. This is an impressive Pinotage bottling. The mid-palate is rich, full-bodied and is highly complex, while the finish is still youthful and has a firm tannic grip that will ensure this wine lasts for decades. Wow! This full-bodied wine ends with a long and highly complex finish with notes of dark chocolate. It is an impressive wine that will captivate your attention.",,RP 88
1344,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 2017 Pinotage Stellenbosch begins with soft feral notes over ripe, spicy fruits. The medium-bodied palate is fresh, vibrant and grippy but I was hoping for just a bit more fruit. The wine is balanced with a decent finish and will be great with peppered steaks, although I have a feeling it will age well and patience will be rewarded. This is currently unreleased in the U.S.",,RP 88
1345,Kanonkop,Kadette Cape Blend,"A blend of 37% Pinotage, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Kadette Cape Blend is smoky with red and black fruit over a mineral core with a spicy and herbal edge. Smoked bell peppers with a dusty grip and persistent red spice linger on the medium-bodied palate. The concluding expression is spicy with an herbal and granitic grip and a decent finish. This wine makes me think of steak fajitas on a sizzling platter, with red meat, bell peppers and onions all caramelizing together.",,RP 88
1346,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The nose of the 2016 Pinotage Stellenbosch has an open-knit expression with dark spicy fruits, floral tones and soft subtle oak aromas of cinnamon and vanilla. The full-bodied palate is clean and rich with a full expression of ripe blackberries and drinks like a robust Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak is evident on the palate but hasn't been overdone, integrating seamlessly into the expression. The rich blackberries and plum tones glide over the mid-palate and it finishes long and a touch spicy, with balance and precision.",,RP 88
1347,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage,"The nose of the 2016 Kadette Pinotage is black fruited with an herbal and black spice edge, with soft hints of oak and juicy plums. The medium to full-bodied palate is plush with an open core of fruit, lingering oak on the back end and subtle herbs and spices, with a decent, spicy finish. I imagine this working well with barbecue.",,RP 88
1348,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"On the nose, the 2015 Paul Sauer is full of dark fruit with a hearty core of oak. Full-bodied, the palate is focused and balanced with tannic grip, structured and chewy with a spiciness that could linger for days and with a long, complex finish. The fruit will absorb the oak and that tannic nature will soften over the coming years. If you can get hold of a bottle, put it in your cellar for further aging. I welcome the opportunity to revisit this bottle in another ten years.",,RP 88
1349,Kanonkop,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soon to be released in the US, the bold and lush 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon has a dark-fruited core with good complexity and soft oak tones. On the palate, the wine is fresh and ripe, with a core of dense, chewy black fruit that is connected to the oak by way of subtle baking spices. The mid-palate expresses a focus of balanced and structured complexity. It lingers long on the finish, showing a well-built wine that can be cellar-aged for years to come or enjoyed with fine cuts of grilled red meat for dinner tonight.",,RP 88
1350,Kanonkop,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon offers a rich nose with a dark-fruited core of blackberries, dark plum, cassis and soft oak spices of cinnamon and nutmeg, with a focused and dusty minerality. Full-bodied on the palate, the wine is packed with juicy and rustic dark fruit and subtle, integrated oak tones that linger through the mid-palate. It's a quality-minded wine with precise, focused balance and a long finish.",,RP 88
1351,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2013 Paul Sauer has a black and red-fruited nose with wafts of spice and dusty minerality. The palate is focused and balanced, with a dense and chewy core that moves from fruit expression to dark chocolate and soft flower notes. It has grippy tannins and the finish is bold, long and balanced with a pleasantly grippy tannic edge.",,RP 88
1352,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage Rose,"The 2016 Kadette Pinotage Rose is made in a fuller style. It has a pale salmon color. The nose is fresh on the entry with touches of orange peel, red cherries and a touch of marzipan. The palate is fresh on the entry with light red fruit, nicely weighted in the mouth with a squeeze of lemon zest on the finish.",,RP 88
1353,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2015 Black Label Pinotage is the current release, from the oldest vines around 65 years in age. Matured entirely in new French oak for 18 months, it has a ripe and more opulent bouquet compared to the more modest 2014, but what they share is fine delineation and purity, aromas of black cherry, camphor, blueberry and cassis. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannin, layers of black fruit intermingling with dried herbs, sage, rosemary and white pepper, fanning out beautifully on the finish. It will benefit from 4-5 years in bottle as usual, but it is an immensely impressive expression of Pinotage—a bit of a head-turner, you could say.",,RP 88
1354,Kanonkop,Kadette Cape Blend,"The 2015 Kadette Cape Blend contains 50% Pinotage, 20% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon matured in used oak. It has a light red cherry and bergamot tea scented bouquet that just needs a little more vigor. The palate is fresh on the entry with a touch of green pepper, nicely balanced, simple but with ample freshness on the finish. This is a well-made, entry-level wine from Kanonkop and for the price, it comes recommended.",,RP 88
1355,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage,"The 2015 Kadette Pinotage has a punchy bouquet with layers of toasty black fruit and iodine. The palate is medium-bodied with muscular tannin, although it retains satisfactory balance. This is a bold Pinotage, grippy in the mouth with a structured, powerful finish, a gutsy wine that should be married with a big hearty steak to counter the intensity.",,RP 88
1356,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2014 Black Label Pinotage has a well-defined bouquet with lovely cranberry and loganberry fruit, sage and a freshly tilled earth. The palate is medium-bodied with grippy tannin, a cooler and more masculine Black Label with a sense of reserve towards the finish, as if holding something back. There is plenty of freshness here, long in the mouth, but I would cellar this away for 4-5 years, because I am sure it will develop, rewarding secondary notes and flavors. Just 5,000 bottles produced.",,RP 88
1357,Kanonkop,Pinotage,"The 2014 Pinotage is matured for 16 months in 80% new oak. It offers a vivid and powerful bouquet of black cherries, licorice, melted tar and blueberries that seem to gush from the glass. The palate is powerful on the entry with bold tannin, but there is the acidity here to keep everything balanced and counter the layers of fruit with freshness and tension. As I have written before, Kanonkop know how to make a great Pinotage and this is a delight.",,RP 88
1358,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2013 Paul Sauer is a more or less 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot that is matured 24 months in 100% new French oak (Seguin Moreau, Demptos and Nadalie). It has an attractive bouquet, a mixture of red and black fruit intermingling with star anise and a touch of Chinese five-spice. The palate is medium-bodied and very well balanced with a fine seam of acidity, very impressive purity, and a suave and sophisticated finish that renders this Paul Sauer (as always) a superb value. It will surely give two decades of drinking pleasure.",,RP 88
1359,Kanonkop,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon is matured in 50% new oak for 24 months with an additional two years in bottle (it used to be one year). It has a strong, opulent nose of black cherries, mint and a touch of camphor, later a pleasant hickory note emerging. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin. Tarry black fruit, tobacco and sage, a quintessential Kanonkop wine that stays true to South African Cabernet, but done with a sense of panache and style. Give this 2-3 years in bottle for the tannins to soften a little.",,RP 88
1360,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage Rose,"The 2015 Kadette Pinotage Rosé has a generous, quite peachy, rose petal-tinged bouquet that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is smooth on the entry, a little creamy in texture with a fine bead of acidity and a pretty, Turkish Delight-tinged finish. This is a delightful, easy-drinking Rosé. ",,RP 88
1361,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2013 Black Label Pinotage comes from 62-year-old vines that are bottled separately. The nose is backward, sultry at first, but opens in the glass with cedar-infused black fruit, slightly citric with a glimpses of violet and cassis. The palate is medium-bodied with spicy entry. There is noticeable backbone and structure in situ with a healthy dollop of chocolate-tinged new oak. There is decent depth on the finish, but its stubbornness suggests that cellaring this for 3-4 years will do it no harm at all. I won't mention the price tag.",,RP 90
1362,Kanonkop,Pinotage,"The 2013 Pinotage is matured in 80% French new wood for 16-18 months. It has a tightly-knit nose, broody black fruit, a little introspective with a subtle raisin note on the background. The palate is medium-bodied with toasty tannin. It comes across quite oaky, although there seems to be adequate fruit towards the finish. There is freshness here and racy acidity, though less oak would have been preferable. ",,RP 90
1363,Kanonkop,Kadette Cape Blend,"The 2013 Kadette Cape Blend spent 12 months in used oak. It has a rather dusky, slight herbaceous nose that needs a little more fruit to come through, lest it remains just a bit broody. The palate is medium-bodied with tough tannins framing the entry; it is angular in the mouth with a short finish. I think there are better recent releases from this label.",,RP 90
1364,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2012 Paul Sauer is approximately the same blend as the 2011, matured 24 months in new oak. Actually, the nose is very similar to the previous vintage with mint-tinged, floral black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with taut tannin, quite backward and primal as you would expect, the oak lifting the finish that at the moment does not quite have the persistence of the 2011. Let's see what happens over the next year.",,RP 90
1365,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot, matured in new oak for 24 months, the 2011 Paul Sauer has a very lifted, perfumed nose that is well defined and unlike the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon that I tasted alongside, this handles the wood with much more competence. The palate is medium-bodied with mint-tinged black fruit, grippy in the mouth and then a dab of boysenberry and fig, leading to a nicely composed and sustained finish. Give this 3-4 years in bottle and you will have an excellent Bordeaux blend.",,RP 90
1366,Kanonkop,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon spends 24 months in barrel with 50% new oak. It has a backward, slightly broody undergrowth-tinged nose with tobacco and gravelly notes infusing the carapace of black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with toasty tannin, quite austere and reserved in style, but there is a driving line of acidity that maintains freshness. It still feels a little foursquare on the finish, but it should drink well over the next few years. ",,RP 90
1367,Kanonkop,Kadette Rose,"The 2014 Kadette Vintage Rosé is 100% Pinotage that debuted in 2010 from a vineyard specifically grown for rosé wine production. Abrie told me that he prefers to pick a little later to get a good fruit profile. The fruit component certainly does not mess about on the nose with attractive melon, peach and light strawberry scents emerging. The palate is crisp on the entry with sharp acidity but plenty of weight and a crisp, quite linear finish to avoid the risk of blowsiness. This is a commendable rosé.",,RP 90
1368,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2012 Kanonkop Black Label Pinotage comes from 61-year-old vines in the three-hectare Block 202 whose vines stood out every year, hence the separate bottling from 2006. Incidentally, it was initially intended just to show what old vines can do rather than a commercial venture. Matured entirely in new oak, it has a very refined, quite floral bouquet that has exquisite delineation. The palate is very well-balanced with succulent tannins, crisp acidity and a suave, black olive and licorice-infused finish that is long but tender. Excellent. ",,RP 90
1369,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 2012 Pinotage Stellenbosch, which is also raised in 80% new oak, has a little more vigor and opulence compared to the 2011, with orange–sorbet infused black fruit, a touch of crème de cassis and licorice. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine candied entry, lovely orange sorbet and marmalade notes with a touch of allspice and white pepper toward the finish. Lovely. ",,RP 90
1370,Kanonkop,Kadette Pinotage,"The 2012 Kadette Pinotage is the first release, a response to demand for a lower-priced Pinotage from Kanonkop. The nose is cleaner and purer than the Cape Blend, with quite lush, macerated black cherries, blackberry and cedar fruit, quite reserved but nicely focused. The palate is well-balanced with slightly furry tannins. There is good depth of fruit here and well-judged acidity, with pleasant black pepper notes toward the finish. ",,RP 90
1371,Kanonkop,Kadette Cape Blend,"The 2012 Kadette Cape Blend comes from younger vines in their own vineyard and from neighboring farms that Kanonkop manage. The grapes are hand-sorted and raised in small, older barrels for at least 12 months. It has a fruit-driven bouquet with scents of black cherry, iodine and just a touch of banana skin. The palate is a little rustic on the entry with crisp acidity. The texture is a little gritty in the mouth with a punchy, slightly short, black-olive-tinged finish. ",,RP 90
1372,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 2011 Pinotage Stellenbosch, which sees around 80% new oak, has a tightly wound bouquet at the moment, the aromatics that will need time to subsume the wood. The palate is supple on the entry with fine acidity. There is good depth here with a crisp, orange-rind-tinged finish, touches of Moroccan spice lingering on the finish that is beginning to fully assimilate the new wood. Great potential here.  ",,RP 90
1373,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2010 Kanonkop Paul Sauer has slighty redder fruit on the nose compared to the 2011, with touches of dried violet and camphor that emerge with time. The palate is sweet and supple on the entry. The acidity is crisp and lends tension here, with a pleasant saline note emerging toward the structured finish with a long spicy tail. Very fine. (N.B. I am assuming this cuvée will be auctions by the Cape Winemakers Guild since I tasted it later at the CWG tasting in London.)",,RP 90
1374,Kanonkop,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2004 Kanonkop Cabernet Sauvignon has an intriguing bouquet: blackberry, a touch of espresso, mint and sage – quite intense and focused. The palate is ripe on the entry with dusky, cocoa-tinged black fruit. There is a good line of acidity and focus, segueing toward a more reserved, quite linear finish. This is drinking beautifully now.",,RP 90
1375,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2003 Kanonkop Paul Sauer Stellenbosch has the highest percentage of Cabernet Franc used to date (31%) with 6% Merlot and 63% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a very refined bouquet, very pure, with star-anise-tinged black fruit with hints of bell pepper and tertiary notes emerging with time. The palate has an understated entry with a slightly grainy texture: blackberry, black olive, a touch of menthol and dried orange rind toward the finish. This is drinking now, but will continue to evolve over 15 to 20 years.",,RP 90
1376,Kanonkop,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 1999 Pinotage Stellenbosch hardly appears to have aged in the intervening period. It replicates its performance three years ago. The nose has a light menthol-tinged note that becomes accentuated with aeration, augmented by touches of five spice and marmalade. The palate is ripe and nicely controlled on the entry. Touches of espresso and cedar infuse the black fruit, with a slight touch of cocoa toward the well-balanced, Bordeaux-like finish. Fine. ",,RP 90
1377,Kanonkop,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2011 Black Label Pinotage sees 18 months in barrel and I have to say that I do not necessarily find it superior to the regular bottling. Certainly it has a more ravishing bouquet than the regular Pinotage, although contrasting the two side-by-side, it does not possess quite the same focus. The palate is better with raisin and fig-tinged black fruit, firm tannins and a touch of salted licorice on the voluminous finish. This is very fine and should age with style, although personally I would buy three bottles of the Pinotage instead of one Black Label. Drink now-2018+.  

At a time when a lot of the so-called old guard are rapidly being outpaced, outflanked by the new generation of winemakers who have travelled overseas and introduced a more thoughtful approach to their craft, Kanonkop are a testament to fact that some of the country’s stalwarts can remain at the top of their game. Many producers merely pay lip service to the notion of finesse, but at Kanonkop that is evident where it matters – in the glass. So kudos to owners Johann and Paul Krige and especially to winemaker Abrie Beeslaar, installed at Kanonkop since 2002, for all their hard work. What I found interesting was Abrie’s conviction that Kanonkop has remained true to what it does, ignoring fads and fashions, merely fine-tuning its style. I have to say that over the last ten years their wines have attained a greater degree of refinement and purity, therefore something must have changed! What distinguishes Kanonkop is both the enviable age of some of its vine stock, especially its Pinotage, and the corollary of longevity. These are wines that are probably drunk way too early by consumers, although I can understand why. Chuck two or three bottles in your cellar and leave them for 20 years – you will be amazed at what you will find. Now for a vertical of Kanonkop’s Pinotage, which were all shown at a tasting in London in the presence of the owners and winemaker of Kanonkop. As I have already mentioned, Pinotage has an under-appreciated propensity to age, hence my reason for publishing these notes. Kanonkop boasts some of South Africa’s oldest Pinotage plantings from 1953. The fruit is fermented in open-top fermenters with punching down every two hours and then raised for 18 months in oak, usually around 80% new. Abrie stressed that in his opinion, new oak is essential to make a truly great Pinotage. That is not a view that I would necessarily agree with, though on the other hand there is no question that Kanonkop’s Pinotage soaks up that new wood with style and it is completely subsumed with age.

1378,Kanonkop,Paul Sauer,"The 2010 Paul Sauer sees 24 months in oak barrels. It has a well-defined, clean fresh bouquet that handles the oak better than many of its peers: a bouquet imbued with a sense of confidence and focus. The palate is medium-bodied with a fresh, lithe entry and a fine thread of acidity. There is plenty of red and black fruit to savor, a solid but unimposing backbone, while the finish has a lovely saline finish and impressive finesse and sense of sophistication. This is a classy South African Bordeaux blend. Drink now-2019.

Perhaps this has closed down in recent months? The palate is medium-bodied with a supple, fleshy, caressing opening. The oak needs another couple of years to fully integrate, and the finish is glitzy but without the tension of the 2009. This is still a very commendable Pinotage however.

As I have already mentioned, Pinotage has an under-appreciated propensity to age, hence my reason for publishing these notes. Kanonkop boasts some of South Africa’s oldest Pinotage plantings from 1953. The fruit is fermented in open-top fermenters with punching down every two hours and then raised for 18 months in oak, usually around 80% new. Abrie stressed that in his opinion, new oak is essential to make a truly great Pinotage. That is not a view that I would necessarily agree with, though on the other hand there is no question that Kanonkop’s Pinotage soaks up that new wood with style and it is completely subsumed with age.

At a time when a lot of the so-called old guard are rapidly being outpaced, outflanked by the new generation of winemakers who have travelled overseas and introduced a more thoughtful approach to their craft, Kanonkop are a testament to fact that some of the country’s stalwarts can remain at the top of their game. Many producers merely pay lip service to the notion of finesse, but at Kanonkop that is evident where it matters – in the glass. So kudos to owners Johann and Paul Krige and especially to winemaker Abrie Beeslaar, installed at Kanonkop since 2002, for all their hard work. What I found interesting was Abrie’s conviction that Kanonkop has remained true to what it does, ignoring fads and fashions, merely fine-tuning its style. I have to say that over the last ten years their wines have attained a greater degree of refinement and purity, therefore something must have changed! What distinguishes Kanonkop is both the enviable age of some of its vine stock, especially its Pinotage, and the corollary of longevity. These are wines that are probably drunk way too early by consumers, although I can understand why. Chuck two or three bottles in your cellar and leave them for 20 years – you will be amazed at what you will find. Now for a vertical of Kanonkop’s Pinotage, which were all shown at a tasting in London in the presence of the owners and winemaker of Kanonkop. As I have already mentioned, Pinotage has an under-appreciated propensity to age, hence my reason for publishing these notes. Kanonkop boasts some of South Africa’s oldest Pinotage plantings from 1953. The fruit is fermented in open-top fermenters with punching down every two hours and then raised for 18 months in oak, usually around 80% new. Abrie stressed that in his opinion, new oak is essential to make a truly great Pinotage. That is not a view that I would necessarily agree with, though on the other hand there is no question that Kanonkop’s Pinotage soaks up that new wood with style and it is completely subsumed with age.

The nose is backward, sultry at first, but opens in the glass with cedar-infused black fruit, slightly citric with a glimpses of violet and cassis. The palate is medium-bodied with spicy entry. There is noticeable backbone and structure in situ with a healthy dollop of chocolate-tinged new oak. There is decent depth on the finish, but its stubbornness suggests that cellaring this for 3-4 years will do it no harm at all. I won't mention the price tag.",,RP 90
1405,Domaine Roulot,Pinotage,"The 2013 Pinotage is matured in 80% French new wood for 16-18 months. It has a tightly-knit nose, broody black fruit, a little introspective with a subtle raisin note on the background. The palate is medium-bodied with toasty tannin. It comes across quite oaky, although there seems to be adequate fruit towards the finish. There is freshness here and racy acidity, though less oak would have been preferable. ",,RP 90
1406,Domaine Roulot,Kadette Cape Blend,"The 2013 Kadette Cape Blend spent 12 months in used oak. It has a rather dusky, slight herbaceous nose that needs a little more fruit to come through, lest it remains just a bit broody. The palate is medium-bodied with tough tannins framing the entry; it is angular in the mouth with a short finish. I think there are better recent releases from this label.",,RP 90
1407,Domaine Roulot,Paul Sauer,"The 2012 Paul Sauer is approximately the same blend as the 2011, matured 24 months in new oak. Actually, the nose is very similar to the previous vintage with mint-tinged, floral black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with taut tannin, quite backward and primal as you would expect, the oak lifting the finish that at the moment does not quite have the persistence of the 2011. Let's see what happens over the next year.",,RP 90
1408,Domaine Roulot,Paul Sauer,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot, matured in new oak for 24 months, the 2011 Paul Sauer has a very lifted, perfumed nose that is well defined and unlike the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon that I tasted alongside, this handles the wood with much more competence. The palate is medium-bodied with mint-tinged black fruit, grippy in the mouth and then a dab of boysenberry and fig, leading to a nicely composed and sustained finish. Give this 3-4 years in bottle and you will have an excellent Bordeaux blend.",,RP 90
1409,Domaine Roulot,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon spends 24 months in barrel with 50% new oak. It has a backward, slightly broody undergrowth-tinged nose with tobacco and gravelly notes infusing the carapace of black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with toasty tannin, quite austere and reserved in style, but there is a driving line of acidity that maintains freshness. It still feels a little foursquare on the finish, but it should drink well over the next few years. ",,RP 90
1410,Domaine Roulot,Kadette Rose,"The 2014 Kadette Vintage Rosé is 100% Pinotage that debuted in 2010 from a vineyard specifically grown for rosé wine production. Abrie told me that he prefers to pick a little later to get a good fruit profile. The fruit component certainly does not mess about on the nose with attractive melon, peach and light strawberry scents emerging. The palate is crisp on the entry with sharp acidity but plenty of weight and a crisp, quite linear finish to avoid the risk of blowsiness. This is a commendable rosé.",,RP 90
1411,Domaine Roulot,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2012 Kanonkop Black Label Pinotage comes from 61-year-old vines in the three-hectare Block 202 whose vines stood out every year, hence the separate bottling from 2006. Incidentally, it was initially intended just to show what old vines can do rather than a commercial venture. Matured entirely in new oak, it has a very refined, quite floral bouquet that has exquisite delineation. The palate is very well-balanced with succulent tannins, crisp acidity and a suave, black olive and licorice-infused finish that is long but tender. Excellent. ",,RP 90
1412,Domaine Roulot,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 2012 Pinotage Stellenbosch, which is also raised in 80% new oak, has a little more vigor and opulence compared to the 2011, with orange–sorbet infused black fruit, a touch of crème de cassis and licorice. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine candied entry, lovely orange sorbet and marmalade notes with a touch of allspice and white pepper toward the finish. Lovely. ",,RP 90
1413,Domaine Roulot,Kadette Pinotage,"The 2012 Kadette Pinotage is the first release, a response to demand for a lower-priced Pinotage from Kanonkop. The nose is cleaner and purer than the Cape Blend, with quite lush, macerated black cherries, blackberry and cedar fruit, quite reserved but nicely focused. The palate is well-balanced with slightly furry tannins. There is good depth of fruit here and well-judged acidity, with pleasant black pepper notes toward the finish. ",,RP 90
1414,Domaine Roulot,Kadette Cape Blend,"The 2012 Kadette Cape Blend comes from younger vines in their own vineyard and from neighboring farms that Kanonkop manage. The grapes are hand-sorted and raised in small, older barrels for at least 12 months. It has a fruit-driven bouquet with scents of black cherry, iodine and just a touch of banana skin. The palate is a little rustic on the entry with crisp acidity. The texture is a little gritty in the mouth with a punchy, slightly short, black-olive-tinged finish. ",,RP 90
1415,Domaine Roulot,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 2011 Pinotage Stellenbosch, which sees around 80% new oak, has a tightly wound bouquet at the moment, the aromatics that will need time to subsume the wood. The palate is supple on the entry with fine acidity. There is good depth here with a crisp, orange-rind-tinged finish, touches of Moroccan spice lingering on the finish that is beginning to fully assimilate the new wood. Great potential here.  ",,RP 90
1416,Domaine Roulot,Paul Sauer,"The 2010 Kanonkop Paul Sauer has slighty redder fruit on the nose compared to the 2011, with touches of dried violet and camphor that emerge with time. The palate is sweet and supple on the entry. The acidity is crisp and lends tension here, with a pleasant saline note emerging toward the structured finish with a long spicy tail. Very fine. (N.B. I am assuming this cuvée will be auctions by the Cape Winemakers Guild since I tasted it later at the CWG tasting in London.)",,RP 90
1417,Domaine Roulot,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2004 Kanonkop Cabernet Sauvignon has an intriguing bouquet: blackberry, a touch of espresso, mint and sage – quite intense and focused.

This is drinking beautifully now.",,RP 90
1418,Domaine Roulot,Paul Sauer,"The 2003 Kanonkop Paul Sauer Stellenbosch has the highest percentage of Cabernet Franc used to date (31%) with 6% Merlot and 63% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a very refined bouquet, very pure, with star-anise-tinged black fruit with hints of bell pepper and tertiary notes emerging with time. The palate has an understated entry with a slightly grainy texture: blackberry, black olive, a touch of menthol and dried orange rind toward the finish. This is drinking now, but will continue to evolve over 15 to 20 years.",,RP 90
1419,Domaine Roulot,Pinotage Stellenbosch,"The 1999 Pinotage Stellenbosch hardly appears to have aged in the intervening period. It replicates its performance three years ago. The nose has a light menthol-tinged note that becomes accentuated with aeration, augmented by touches of five spice and marmalade. The palate is ripe and nicely controlled on the entry. Touches of espresso and cedar infuse the black fruit, with a slight touch of cocoa toward the well-balanced, Bordeaux-like finish. Fine. ",,RP 90
1420,Domaine Roulot,Black Label Pinotage,"The 2011 Black Label Pinotage sees 18 months in barrel and I have to say that I do not necessarily find it superior to the regular bottling. Certainly it has a more ravishing bouquet than the regular Pinotage, although contrasting the two side-by-side, it does not possess quite the same focus. The palate is better with raisin and fig-tinged black fruit, firm tannins and a touch of salted licorice on the voluminous finish. This is very fine and should age with style, although personally I would buy three bottles of the Pinotage instead of one Black Label. Drink now-2018+.

1431,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Aligoté,"Bright and fine-boned, the 2021 Bourgogne Aligoté is a medium-bodied, satiny and tangy white redolent of white flowers and crisp green apple. Vinified without chaptalization, its intensity of flavor belies its modest alcoholic degree.",,RP (94-96)
1432,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Tillets,"The 2021 Meursault Tillets marks a return to the range for this recently replanted climat, but only on a small scale, as only one barrel was produced.

1439,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"The 2020 Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères is excellent, exhibiting aromas of citrus oil and pear mingled with notes of fresh bread, dried white flowers and iodine. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, it's ample but precise, with a satiny attack that segues into a vibrant mid-palate, concluding with a long, saline finish.

1447,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The king of the cellar is the 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières, a striking young wine that unwinds in the glass with scents of citrus oil, white flowers, crisp green apple, clear honey and bread dough, framed by a deft touch of youthful reduction.

1449,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusot,"The 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Porusot is promising, bursting with notes of pear, white flowers, citrus zest, fresh bread and vanilla pod.

This is quite rich for a young Vireuils, but I suspect it will tighten up during another winter on the lees.",,RP (94-96)
1455,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"With the 2019 Meursault Village, Roulot's usual blend of Clos de la Baronne, Crotot, Gruyaches and Sous la Velle is complemented by a parcel of Narvaux and his young vines in Luchets.

1458,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2018 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières dominates the range even more self-evidently than its 2019 counterpart, unwinding in the glass with notions of citrus oil, smoke, crushed rocks, white flowers, Anjou pear and wet stones. Medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, its satiny attack segues into a tightly wound, nicely concentrated mid-palate that gives way to a long, penetrating and chalky finish. Roulot has decided to late-release the 2018 Perrières after a few years, so it isn't yet on the market.",,RP (94-96)

1463,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"The 2018 Meursault Meix Chavaux has turned out very nicely in bottle, offering up aromas of citrus oil, crisp green orchard fruit, pastry cream and almond paste, complemented by hints of clear honey, that haven't changed much since I last encountered the wine 12 months ago. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, its elegantly textural attack segues into a racy, acid-driven mid-palate and a penetrating, mineral finish.",,RP (94-96)
1464,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Luchets,"The 2018 Meursault Luchets has turned out nicely, unwinding in the glass with hints of minty orchard fruit, fresh bread, oyster shells, dried white flowers and nutmeg.

1465,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Vireuils,"The 2018 Meursault Vireuils is showing nicely in bottle, unwinding in the glass with hints of crisp Anjou pear, citrus oil, nutmeg and fresh bread. Medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and incisive, with a pretty core of fruit underpinned by a racy spine of acidity, it concludes with a chalky, penetrating finish.

1466,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"The 2018 Meursault Village is showing nicely out of the gates, bursting with aromas of crisp orchard fruit, white peach, blanched almonds and wheat toast.

1471,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères is showing superbly from bottle, bursting with aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, white currants, dried flowers, nutmeg and fresh pastry. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and supple, with an enveloping but incisive profile, underpinned by electric acids and chalky extract.

1472,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes unwinds in the glass with a complex bouquet of pear, almond paste, citrus oil, white flowers and mandarin, hints of hazelnut emerging as it sits in the glass. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and muscular, with racy acids, chewy dry extract and a long, mineral finish. This is built for the cellar and will likely prove one of the sleepers in the Roulot cellar this year.",,RP (94-96)
1473,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"Roulot's 2017 Meursault Meix Chavaux is more reserved than the Luchets and Vireuils, unwinding in the glass with a youthfully reticent bouquet of crisp green orchard fruit, citrus oil and pastry cream. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with superb depth and definition, racy acids and a long, chalky finish.

1475,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"A touch more muscular and textural than the Vireuils that preceded it, the 2017 Meursault Les Luchets reveals a lovely bouquet of Anjou pear, confit lemon, citrus zest, dried white flowers and nutmeg.

The inherent tension of the site is tempered by the charm of the vintage to compelling effect.",,RP (94-96)
1477,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"Gently sun-kissed scents of Asian pear, white flowers and honeycomb introduce the 2017 Meursault Village, a medium to full-bodied, satiny-textured and elegantly fleshy wine derived from the Clos de la Baronne, Crotot, Gruyaches and Sous la Velle; as that palette of lieux-dits implies, it's the most open-knit, gourmand and forward Meursault in the domaine's range.",,RP (94-96)
1478,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,"Jean-Marc Roulot's lovely 2017 Bourgogne Blanc wafts from the glass with inviting aromas of citrus oil, white flowers, Anjou pear and a delicate touch of clear honey.

1480,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"One of the high points of the vintage, Roulot's 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières is extraordinarily good, unfurling in the glass with a deep but youthfully reserved bouquet of green apple, wet stones, citrus oil, white flowers, beeswax and fresh pastry. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with incisive acids, striking structural tension and a sense of elegance that renders this wine deceptively charming despite its tightly-coiled core and immense reserves of depth and concentration. That elegance makes drinking a bottle today a decidedly pleasurable experience—after all, drinking a young, tight-knit Meursault Perrières can sometimes be a rather brutalizing experience—even though the wine is really built for extended bottle age.",,RP (94-96)
1481,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2015 Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson is showing very well from bottle, unfurling in the glass with aromas of waxy citrus rind, Anjou pear, beeswax and iodine, framed by a light touch of leesy reduction.

1482,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Vireuils,"Elegant and charming, the 2013 Meursault Les Vireuils offers up a reserved bouquet of flinty citrus complemented by subtle top notes of honey and apricot. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, fine-boned and delicate, with an incisive, tangy profile. It should enjoy a broad drinking window.",,RP (94-96)
1483,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Meix Chavaux,"The 2011 Meursault Les Meix Chavaux is showing well, wafting from the glass with notes of citrus oil, white flowers, crushed chalk and a light framing of reduction.

1484,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"Roulot's 2009 Meursault Les Tillets is really exceptional, opening in the glass with aromas of wheat toast, hazelnut and green orchard fruit, framed by light reduction that dissipates with aeration. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, sappy and intense, with an elegantly glossy attack, good mid-palate depth and plenty of youthful grip on the long, vibrant finish.

1486,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Vireuils,"Roulot's 2000 Meursault Les Vireuils is fully mature and drinking very well, offering up a complex bouquet of buttered apples, dried apricot, fresh field mushroom and honey. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, nicely concentrated and succulent, with a layered, multidimensional texture and a sapid finish. A great success for this stony lieu-dit on the Meursault hillside.",,RP (94-96)
1487,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières is firmly shut down, offering up only a reticent bouquet of iodine, toasted nuts and citrus oil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, tangy and bright but decidedly taut, playing its cards very close to its vest. From barrel, this was the most intense and concentrated wine in Roulot's cellar, with immense potential, but given how closed the wine is today, there is really no point pulling corks for a good five years.",,RP (94-96)
1488,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères is quite reserved, unfurling with extended aeration to exhibit notes of Anjou pear, crisp white peach and spring flowers, against a subtle background of almond paste. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, elegantly glossy and deceptively open-knit, with juicy acids and a mouthwatering, saline finish. Right now, only the outlines of what this showed during élevage and what it will be in a few more years' time are apparent, so I would encourage readers to forget any bottles they may own until 2020.",,RP (94-96)
1489,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2015 Meursault Les Tillets is lovely, wafting from the glass with notes of yellow orchard fruit, hazelnut and beeswax.

1490,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Perrières looks set to rank as one of Jean-Marc Roulot's all-time greats, and while it is still youthful, its incredible potential is already clear to see. A classic bouquet of citrus zest, white flowers, chalky soil tones and blanched almond introduce a searingly intense wine that marries striking cut and vertical tension with wonderful glossy amplitude and dimension, its tongue-tingling minerality persisting through the long, penetrating finish. A benchmark example of Roulot's singular style.",,RP (94-96)
1491,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Roulot's 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Clos de Bouchères was startling when I tasted it from barrel with Jean-Marc. Here it was showing quite a bit of new oak on the nose that erased some of the terroir, at least at the moment. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, notes of lime and fresh pear, perhaps a little obvious compared to some of its peers but with an appealing salinité on the finish. It has just lost a bit of the sparkle, that chiseled mineralité that is exuded in its nascent stage. I will keep my fingers crossed.",,RP (94-96)
1492,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2014 Meursault Les Tillets has that wonderful mineral bite on the nose: cold granite, sea cave and with just a cheeky hint of praline in the background. The palate is very well balanced, with a piercing thread of acidity that fans out with hints of dried honey. Orange peel, mandarin and dried quince are on the long finish. This is one of the finest wines that Jean-Marc Roulot has produced from this vineyard. Tasted February 2017.",,RP (94-96)
1493,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2012 Meursault Les Tillets has more reduction on the nose than the 2014 Tillets, although it blew away with aeration. It is very focused and intense, with waxy aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine, yet still with a quasi-Mosel personality. The palate is very well balanced, with fresh citrus peel, orange pith, Chinese 5-spice and nutmeg notes toward the sustained finish. This appears to be improving with age. It's a complex and quite riveting Meursault that will root you to the spot. Tasted February 2017.",,RP (94-96)
1494,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"The 2015 Meursault les Meix Chavaux, which had not been fined, has one of the more austere bouquets from Jean-Marc Roulot this year. In fact, it is quite Puligny-likein style with cold granite and green apple scents. The palate is very fresh on the entry, sea spray and oyster shell infusing the citrus fruit, leading to a very spicy finish. This comes highly recommended, especially for those seeking a slightly more austere take on the 2015 whites.",,RP (94-96)
1495,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusot,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru le Porusot, which since 2014 comes from just one plot on the lieu-dit of Porusot-Dessus, was matured in one-quarter new oak. It was a bit reticent on the nose when I tasted it, the aromatics stubborn and refusing to show themselves. The palate is much more responsive: just a touch of reduction on the entry then a lively second half with fresh grapefruit, Granny Smith apple and pear, leading to a vibrant saline finish. Despite the recalcitrant nose, my feeling is that this may well turn out to be one of Jean-Marc's best 2015s.",,RP (94-96)
1496,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Vireuils,"The 2015 Meursault Vireuils, which had not been fined unlike some others, offers enticing aromas of nectarine and white peach mixed with subtle melted wax aromas. It comes across as detailed and quite ""attacking"" in style. The palate is very well balanced with a harmonious entry. It sashays along with white peach, citrus lemon and hints of frangipane, leading to a cohesive and quite intense spicy finish. This is very fine, Jean-Marc, very fine.",,RP (94-96)
1497,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes is more strict and linear on the nose compared to many other 2015 Charmes that I tasted, with subtle scents of melted candle wax, persimmon and peony. The palate is very well balanced with crisp acidity, taut and linear with hints of white peach and orange pith towards the somehow sensual finish. This is superb and it may merit a higher score once in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1498,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"The 2015 Meursault Village, which comes mostly from Clos de Baronne, was ready for bottling (essentially the finished wine). It has a crisp lime flower and red apple scented bouquet, later just a hint of grilled almond that enhanced the complexity. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity that cuts through the surprisingly mineral-rich citrus fruit. There is a lovely saline tang that lingers on the finish. Enjoy this lovely, well-crafted Meursault over the next six to eight years.",,RP (90-92)
1499,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"The 2015 Meursault Les Luchets has a very strict bouquet, quite granitic with fumé scents, nicely focused with hints of Granny Smith apples and freshly sliced Conference pear. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, a little richer than the Mes Chavaux, but maybe just missing that killer precision on the finish. Hopefully this will catch up with its stablemates in the future.",,RP (90-92)
1500,Domaine Roulot,Auxey Duresses Blanc,"The 2015 Auxey Duresses Blanc, which comes from three tiny parcels and was just about to be bottled, offers pretty stone fruit, nectarine and orange pith on the nose while gaining intensity in the glass. The palate is well balanced with a slightly waxy texture, quite pithy in style with a resinous, but satisfyingly complex finish. This will be well worth seeking out, as it is a charming Auxey-Duresses with panache and style.",,RP (90-92)
1501,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2015 Bourgogne Blanc has a well-defined green apple, cucumber and peach skin bouquet that takes a little while to open in the glass. The palate is quite sharp on the entry with a chalky texture, hints of bitter lemon and green apple towards the brisk finish. Fine, even if it is not a patch on the 2014 last year.",,RP (90-92)
1502,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusot,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru le Porusot will be the last vintage with the parcel of old vines in Le Porusot (the next vintage will be just the parcel in Porusots Dessous). It has a refined bouquet with touches of wild mint and yellow flower infusing the citrus fruit. The palate is very refined, very charming with a keen line of acidity and hints of tropical fruit; but again, it's the mineral tension, the nervosité on the finish that really marks this wine.",,RP (90-92)
1503,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Vireuils,"The 2014 Meursault Virieuls has a similar nose to the Village, although here there is a touch of precision and there is something earthier, more tertiary about the aromatics. The palate is crisp and fresh with vibrant acidity, and very elegant with hints of tropical fruit (grapefruit and passion fruit) lending a little joie-de-vivre on the finish. This is totally sublime.",,RP (90-92)
1504,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has an intense nose of fresh grapefruit, lime flower and a hint of frangipane; it is more rounded than the Bouchères, if not quite possessing the same charm. The palate is crisp on the entry, very saline and tensile with a precise, penetrating finish. This will have much more to give post bottling. Then it will switch on the charm.",,RP (90-92)
1505,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2014 Meursault Tessons Clos de Mon Plaisir has a taut and linear nose that is very intense with aeration; this is a Meursault that is loaded with mineralité. The palate is fresh and vibrant, a little fatness here, very concentrated with hints of apricot and passion fruit on the shimmering finish, then a dab of sea salt on the aftertaste. What a great Meursault Tessons from Jean-Marc Roulot.",,RP (90-92)
1506,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"The 2014 Meursault les Meix Chavaux is more backward and introspective on the nose with limestone and flint here -- pretensions towards Puligny, perhaps? The palate contains a lot of energy, and is a little more malic than the Les Virieuls, but very dense and persistent towards the finish. There is something a little aristocratic about this Meursault and that makes it very appealing.",,RP (90-92)
1507,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"The 2014 Meursault Village is mainly fruit from Clos de la Baronne supplemented by three smaller parcels that represent around 20% of the final blend. It has a brisk, stony, slightly reserved bouquet with touches of Granny Smith, granite and limestone. The palate is fresh and lively on the entry with a keen thread of acidity, and a slight bitter edge that appears on the mid-palate but coalescing nicely towards the tender finish. You will find few Meursault Village as good as this (apart from down the road at Coche perhaps).",,RP (90-92)
1508,Domaine Roulot,Meursault les Luchets,"The 2014 Meursault les Luchets has a very reserved nose, moody and more primal than its peers. The palate is medium-bodied and very well balanced, but it has yet to develop or find its personality unlike the more expressive Les Virieuls. There is certainly nice salinity here, but I'd like to see something more down the line...a little more chutzpah perhaps.",,RP (90-92)
1509,Domaine Roulot,Auxey Duresses,"The 2014 Auxey Duresses Blanc, matured in 15% to 20% new oak, has a low-key bouquet that opens with time, with lime flower, a touch of white tea and Granny Smiths. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity and vibrant citrus fruit that just ease off towards the finish, which shows impressive persistence. This is a very fine Auxey-Duresses from Jean-Marc Roulot.",,RP (90-92)
1510,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2014 Bourgogne Blanc, which the final blend spent five months in vat, has an elegant bouquet with touches of limestone and dewy green apples, sedate and nicely focused. The palate is well balanced with green apple and freshly sliced pear, showing fine transparency and tension on the elegant finish. This is as good a Bourgogne Blanc as you will find.",,RP (90-92)
1511,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Aligote,"The 2014 Bourgogne Aligoté, which was bottled in July, has a terse, stony bouquet with scents of cold granite, quite steely and almost Puligny-like in style. The palate is a little shrill on the entry. There is good acidity here with sour lemon and freshly squeezed lime on the finish. ",,RP (90-92)
1512,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrières from Jean-Marc Roulot exhibits a lot of reduction, perhaps too much and consequently it erases some of the terroir expression and the precision demonstrated by the Perrières from Comtes-Lafon. The palate has a dash of white pepper on the entry: a keen line of acidity, commendable weight in the mouth, powerful but just a little smudged right on the finish due to the alcohol (so I dock a point!).",,RP (90-92)
1513,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes, which was raised in 30% new oak, has a very complex bouquet: a stunning array of limestone, almond, brioche and granite that is very intense and conveys a sense of completeness. The palate is beautifully defined with hints of orange peel on the entry. The acidity is just perfectly judged and there is enormous length on the finish that fans out gloriously, yet maintains assiduous restraint. This must constitute one of the best wines of the vintage.",,RP (90-92)
1514,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru le Porusot had a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath there is real drive, real mineralité coming through, with fantastic delineation. The palate is lively and vivacious, with superb acidity, again just a touch of reduction, but there is a lovely twist of sour lemon and ginger on the long, sustained finish. This is an outstanding Meursault from Jean-Marc and it should give one or two years of pleasure (if you can resist opening a bottle.)",,RP (90-92)
1515,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"The 2013 Meursault les Meix Chavaux has a sense of symmetry on the nose, a little more delicate than the Vireuils with a hint of lavender and potpourri that develops with time in the glass. However, it is not inclined to give much away at the moment. The palate has a twist of bitter lemon on the entry that imports edginess and tension to this Meursault. This is a little wilder than Les Vireuils, a touch spicier with a hint of white fennel toward the finish. This is superb, one of the most outgoing Meix Chavaux that Jean-Marc Roulot has overseen. How can so much pleasure fit into a wine glass?",,RP (90-92)
1516,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"The 2013 Meursault Clos des Bouchères 1er Cru seemed taciturn in the glass at first, but opens up and revels in its mineralité that is very expressive here, one of Jean-Marc's most transparent wines. The palate is medium-bodied, slightly waxy on the entry with fine acidity, intense but one of the most brooding, especially coming after the Poruzots. The finish has a slight tang of seaweed on the aftertaste. It will certainly need three or four years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1517,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières, which comes from the domaines 0.26-hectares of vine purchased in 1976, is not quite as expressive as the Charmes '13 at this stage. But there is a beguiling marine influence here, hints of oyster shells that develop with time. The palate is linear, brooding and strict, touches of lime and stem ginger, long on the finish but perhaps lacking the same charm and personality as the Charmes.",,RP (90-92)
1518,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"The 2013 Meursault Luchets has a wonderful chalky, limestone-scented bouquet that is very detailed and poised, perhaps more ""conservative"" than the Meix Chavaux but with laser-like precision. The palate is fresh and crisp with fine tension, quite saline in the mouth, gently building toward a very intense, almost Puligny-like finish. It does not quite have the length of the Meux Chavaux but there is real presence in the mouth.",,RP (90-92)
1519,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2013 Meursault les Tessons has a feisty nose that is much more a bravura performance following the Les Tillets, veins of licorice developing in the glass, one of the most exotic from Jean-Marc Roulot this year. The palate is vibrant and generous, quite exotic, again very generous. It reminds me a little of a middle-aged man dancing a little too earnestly at a party. Yet it has so much to give, perhaps one of the most fun contributions this year, almost oily in the finish.",,RP (90-92)
1520,Domaine Roulot,Auxey-Duresses Blanc Village,"The 2013 Auxey-Duresses Blanc, which comes from 50-year-old vines that is part fermage and part métayage, has really come up leaps and bounds since I tasted it from barrel last year. Now it has a wonderful bouquet that punches above its weight, subtle custard creme and and almond on the nose, even a hint of coconut. Gorgeous! The palate is well balanced, showing just a little reduction perhaps, but there is very good weight and penetration here, well-judged acidity and a long, lightly spiced finish. This is a sublime Auxey-Duresses Blanc that comes highly recommended.",,RP (90-92)
1521,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"The 2013 Meursault Villages has a detailed bouquet, a little muted perhaps after bottling, but responding to rigorous swirling and offering light grilled walnut and smoky scents. The palate is fresh and vibrant, very well balanced with touches of citrus lemon and grapefruit, a light touch of honey on the finish that suggests there was a little botrytis (perhaps!) Whatever, this is another superb Meursault that seems richer, more decadent that it showed from barrel.",,RP (90-92)
1522,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2013 Meursault Les Tillets is much more reticent on the nose, hints of dried honey emerging with time (this vineyard did contain some pourriture during the growing season.) The palate is fresh on the entry, quite primal, a little awkward at the moment and missing just a little finesse and complexity on the finish. I feel that this is a couple of steps behind the other crus this year. This is a perplexing showing given its performance from barrel, but on this occasion, it didn't quite pass muster.",,RP (90-92)
1523,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2013 Bourgogne Blanc has a light, cockle shell-tinged bouquet with pleasant granitic scents. The palate is brisk and citric on the entry, a pleasant sharpness here, not long, but brimming with freshness, delivering a touch of sea salt and sour lemon on the aftertaste. Drink this over the next two or three years.",,RP (90-92)
1524,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2010 Meursault les Tessons has a lucid silvery sheen. The nose is beautifully defined with walnut, smoke touches of wax resin and fennel. It develops more and more intensity on the nose as it gets into its stride. The palate is well balanced, a little flinty on the entry, a dab of spice, but not quite delivering the complexity one would expect on the finish. Actually tasted blind it is a little more forward than expected and perhaps it's difficult seeing where this will go. Drinking perfectly now.",,RP (90-92)
1525,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Vireuils,"This bottle of 1998 Meursault Les Vireuils from Jean-Marc Roulot  is far better than the one tasted at the domaine last year. It is initially a little smudged and musty on the nose, which may be the reason it threw me last time. But it's just toying with you. Over the period of 30 minutes it tucks its shirt in, combs its hair and reveals a hidden seam of cold wet limestone on the nose that lends it a Puligny-like personality. The palate similarly gains more and more delineation, more precision as it aerates, with pin-point acidity and gorgeous lime and fumé notes on the persistent finish. This is a Meursault that tests your patience, so do not be afraid to open a bottle an hour before pouring. Excellent.",,RP (90-92)
1526,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2001 Meursault 1er Cru les Perrieres from Jean-Marc Roulot has blossomed into a truly wonderful expression of this coveted vineyard. There is absolutely no messing about on the nose as it delivers a payload of mineral-rich, chalky aromas infused with lime flower and fresh green apples. It is just so elegant and pure. The palate is supremely well balanced and manages to convey the mineral intensity of the vineyard, with hints of almond and lanolin on the entry, a killer seam of acidity and a long, oyster shell finish. Utterly beguiling, this constitutes one of the finest mature Meursault from Roulot that I have encountered.",,RP (90-92)
1527,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"I loved this wine last year and I love it now! The 2011 Meursault Tillets is extremely well defined on the nose with wet limestone, dewy green apple and apricot blossom scents all intact. The palate is quite rich and open for Jean-Marc Roulot, but beautifully balanced with a succinct apricot and orange zest finish that is suffused with tension and offers great length. Wonderful.",,RP (90-92)
1528,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Clos de Bouchères from Jean-Marc Roulot has an austere bouquet, with an attractive marine influence of seaweed and seashells, although it needs a little more intensity that should develop with continued bottle age. The palate is balanced with a pleasant fatness on the entry, viscous in texture. There is good fruit concentration here: plenty of matière with a ripe and slightly honeyed finish that suggests just a little botrytis perhaps. This does not quite evince the spectacular showing at the domaine last year, although it is very fine Meursault that will repay cellaring.",,RP (90-92)
1529,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières is very reduced on the nose and it is difficult to perceive much terroir expression at the moment. The palate is pointed and very citric on the entry, really missing cohesion one would expect at the beginning. However with encouragement in the glass, this Meursault begins to shake itself down, gaining more precision and tension with almost every swirl. There is still a bit of SO2 to sort out here, so I would afford it as much decanting as you can, preferably having cellared it for 3 or 4 years.",,RP (90-92)
1530,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"From vines planted way back in 1942, the 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes has a very harmonious, intense bouquet with citrus lemon, fennel, mint and orange zest that are all beautifully defined. The palate is vibrant and tense on the entry, a shard of orange peel that is really penetrating from start to finish. Extremely focused but quite flamboyant, this has everything you could ask for in a Meursault Charmes. This is simply fabulous even if it now does come with a hefty price tag.",,RP (90-92)
1531,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Clos des Bouchères,"The 2012 Meursault Clos des Boucheres has referenced the “clos” on the label since the 2011 vintage. Jean-Marc told me that the clos tends to produce a more elegant wine than “Boucheres” although there is different rootstock, so it probably a combination of those two factors. The 2012 has a slightly more herbaceous bouquet than the Porusot, with touches of nettle and Japanese mirin – introspective, bashful at first but growing in confidence in the glass. The palate is very well balanced with a slight viscosity on the entry, a little more phenolic, with almond, hints of fennel and lemongrass. This is a totally absorbing and cerebral Meursault.",,RP (90-92)
1532,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2012 Meursault les Tessons has a very strict, primal bouquet – taciturn at first, perhaps a little muted compared to Jean-Marc’s other crus at the moment. The palate is crisp on the entry with an intriguing note of sour lemon, intermingling with orange zest, spice and white pepper. This Tessons kinda fools with you as it fans out wonderfully towards the finish with lemongrass and sea salt lingering long after the wine has departed. Wonderful, but it needs a couple of years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
1533,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru le Porusot comes from two parcels and offers a more tertiary bouquet at the moment, quite granitic and linear, aloof but direct. The palate is very well balanced on the entry and comes at you like an express train. Not a subtle Meursault but why should it be? This just delivers spiced citric fruit that like the Tessons, fans out on a very intense and energetic, lemongrass-tinged finish. This may merit a higher evaluation down the line.",,RP (90-92)
1534,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Vireuils,"The 2012 Meursault Les Vireuils has a very complex bouquet with chalk dust, lemon balm and hints of Provençal wild herbs: very well defined and engaging. The palate is beautifully balanced with perfectly judged acidity, hints of melon and white peach with a strict but vibrant citrus and mineral finish. This is one of Jean-Marc’s best 2012s this year.",,RP (90-92)
1535,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Luchets,"The 2012 Meursault Luchets, which comes from two parcels owned by the domaine, has a slightly muffled nose at the moment because of some SO2. The palate is well balanced, stony with touches of white pepper and citrus peel, very elegant towards the finish although without the same depth as the Meix Chavaux. Still, this should be very a fine Meursault, but I suspect one to cellar for two or three years.",,RP (90-92)
1536,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Meix Chavaux,"The 2012 Meursault Meix Chavaux really gets hold of the minerality on the nose – not dissimilar to Anne-Claude Leflaive at her best. The palate is very well balanced, taut and focused with fresh lime, lemon peel and hints of apricot and honeycomb towards the exquisite finish. This is a more ravishing '12 from Jean-Marc, though I find more terroir expression articulated on some of his other Meursault vineyards.",,RP (90-92)
1537,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Village,"The 2012 Meursault Villages has vibrant bouquet with fresh green apples, grass clippings and limestone. The palate is crisp and focused on the marine-influenced entry, very well balanced with clinically executed acidity and a dash of white pepper on the finish. What more do you want from a Meursault Villages? Not a lot.",,RP (90-92)
1538,Domaine Roulot,Auxey-Duresses Blanc Village,"The 2012 Auxey-Duresses Blanc comes from three parcels courtesy from a métayage agreement that began in 2010. It has a reserved, slightly aloof bouquet at first, aromatics that check you the taster out first before decided to reluctantly unfold. The palate is crisp and well defined on the entry – not dissimilar to a St. Aubin en Remilly. The palate is crisp and spicy on the entry with a citrus lemon, lime and a touch of apricot, with a gently build towards the peppery finish. This is well-crafted Auxey-Duresses.",,RP (90-92)
1539,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2012 Bourgogne Blanc, which comes from several parcels and is blended just after racking, has a very precise mineral-rich bouquet that is more like a premier cru – plenty of energy here. The palate is well balanced, not quite as penetrating as the nose, but nicely balanced with a crisp citrus finish and a spicy aftertaste.",,RP (90-92)
1540,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Bouchères,"Following a tasting through his 2012s and an interesting discussion about premature oxidation issues, Jean-Marc kindly offered to open three older bottles that he served blind. The 2007 Meursault Bouchere has a clean, slightly resinous bouquet with hints of dried white flowers, damp straw and dried peach - perhaps a little more forward than I was expecting. The palate is fresh with a popcorn-tinged entry. The palate has a saline entry and fine acidity. It is not complex but it offers a lovely hint of dried honey on the finish with touches of white pepper on the aftertaste. Very fine.",,RP (90-92)
1541,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2007 Meursault Tillets from Jean-Marc Roulot has a refined bouquet with hazelnut and flint aromas: extraordinarily tense and stony. I found myself writing the word “pixelated."" The palate is extremely well-balanced with Granny Smith apple and fresh lime. It is more citric than other wines from Roulot than I have encountered, and if am to quibble, it does not quite possess the persistency of his finest Meursaults. However, it appears to be aging with style and grace and I would enjoy this wine over the next five or six years.",,RP (90-92)
1542,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Bouchères,"The 2005 Meursault Bouchere has a stern, mineral nose that is moving into secondary aromas with almond, touches of fennel, mint and dried apricot. The palate is well balanced with moderate complexity, hints of dried honey just coming through, although it finishes just a little brusquely. This is still quite closed and deserves a couple more years in bottle and then it may well deserve a higher appraisal.",,RP (90-92)
1543,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Bouchères,"The 1996 Meursault Bouchere had quite a deep straw color. There is plenty of honeycomb and even marmalade on the nose although the palate is much fresher than you would expect. Slight resinous texture on the oxidative finish with hints of lemongrass and tangy orange peel. Personally, I need more freshness to counterbalance the oxidative notes but others may appreciate it more than I.",,RP (90-92)
1544,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Vireuils,"The 2005 Meursault Les Virieuils is a pleasurable, if curious Meursault. It has a strident, slightly oxidative bouquet, though analyzing the wine over a period of time, I came to the conclusion that it is not a sign of premature oxidation, rather a character of the wine. One can discern attractive scents of lemon thyme and even a hint of licorice. The palate is well-balanced, with a strong grilled walnut streak from start to finish, a suggestion of white chocolate developing with aeration. The finish does have an oxidative element that cannot go unnoticed, although at the end of the day, this is a pleasing Meursault that I would prefer to drink in the near future. Tasted March 2014.",,RP (90-92)
1545,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"This is a perplexing showing of Jean-Marc Roulot’s 2008 Meursault Le Porusot. It certainly has a mature bouquet considering the vintage, with honeycomb and pungent waxy aromas, all vestige of fruit gone. Premox? The palate is full in the mouth with buttery fruit and glycerine-rich finish. Shared between three Roulot-lovers, suffice to say we only finished about half the bottle. Tasted December 2013.",,RP (90-92)
1546,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrieres, which is being matured in 30% new oak, has a sophisticated bouquet that is initially understated and only gradually unveils flint and granitic scents, followed by Granny Smith apple and white peach. The palate is simply gorgeous: beautifully balanced with pitch perfect acidity. It has ineffable focus and precision, nothing out of place, yet not an extravagant wine in any wine. The finish has a hint of feistiness that might become accentuated after bottling. Superb.

Due to the exceptionally late malolactic fermentation, I only tasted around half of Jean-Marc Roulot’s 2012s. It was the usual travails that discombobulated the vineyards in 2012: poor flowering, rain in the early half of the season and pressure of mildew. The hailstorm on June 30 affected Jean-Marc’s parcels in the north of Meursault village, the second in August more those in the south. I will return next year to make a full account of his 2012s, but here are the five that were in a representative condition to taste.

1547,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"The 2012 Meursault Luchots, like the Meix Chavaux had finished its malolactic fermentation at the end of July. It has an expressive, mineral-driven bouquet accompanied by fresh green apple and wet pavement – almost Chablis-like in style. The palate is medium-bodied with a more feminine, perhaps more harmonious palate than the Meix Chavaux at present, offering light apricot and shaved ginger notes on the finish. This has great potential.

The palate is well-balanced with a pretty opening, furnished with hints of white peach and fresh lime, building nicely in the mouth towards a gentle spice-tinged finish. There is a pleasing fatness in the mouth here and impressive persistency.

1549,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"The 2012 Bourgogne Blanc had finished its malolactic fermentation at the beginning of September. It has a tight, crisp bouquet with limestone and dewy green apple scents that are muted at the moment. The palate is clean and crisp on the entry, stony rather than fruity with a brisk, light finish. 

Due to the exceptionally late malolactic fermentation, I only tasted around half of Jean-Marc Roulot’s 2012s. It was the usual travails that discombobulated the vineyards in 2012: poor flowering, rain in the early half of the season and pressure of mildew. The hailstorm on June 30 affected Jean-Marc’s parcels in the north of Meursault village, the second in August more those in the south. I will return next year to make a full account of his 2012s, but here are the five that were in a representative condition to taste.

1550,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2011 Meursault 1er Cru Perrieres has a show-stopping bouquet that roots you to the spot – demonstrating incredible mineralite and intensity. The palate is beautifully balanced and vibrant. Compared to Jean-Marc’s other crus it comes across spicier with a dab of freshly shaved ginger. It leads to a peacock’s tail on the finish that is simply multi-dimensional – shimmering with brilliance. This is a mind-blowing Perrieres – you have been warned! Drink 2014-2030+ 

Wine is full of hyperbole, now more than ever, but not with respect to the exceptional wines of Jean-Marc Roulot, a grower that has consistently wowed my palate for several years. Although I have met him intermittently in London, this was the first time I had visited his winery on the outskirts of Meursault, just up the road from Coche-Dury. I wonder if their geographical proximity has something to do with stylistic similarities between the two addresses since nobody captures mineralite like these two artisans. It was a good job I penciled in an appointment this week under clement skies. As we descend to his spotlessly clean, relatively capacious cellar he informs me that it was under several inches of water after the previous week’s deluges in late May. Jean-Marc is an engaging vigneron, as one might expect from the former professional actor. I should put that in the present tense since he was about to film a French drama in Beaune, playing a gendarme rather than a winemaker. We tasted a handful of slightly older wines before broaching the 2011s. Moving on to a comprehensive run through his 2011s that had been bottled between January and April, I asked him for his sentiment toward the growing season. “I feel positive toward the vintage after the 2010,” he enthused, “as it is always difficult after such a lauded vintage. The main factor is that in 2011 the grapes were healthy and everything was clean. This was not the case in 2010, which needed some sorting. Maybe the wines are not as powerful, but they are more elegant and precise with better terroir expression. Many things during the season were similar to 2007: hot spring with early flowering; July not so good but flowering and harvest early. We began 24 August with the full team beginning on the 28 August. The 2011s have lower total acidity than 2010 but pH levels are a little better. Also, alcohol potential was around 0.8 degrees lower. I feel more comfortable with this level of alcohol, around 12.5%, than say 13.5% to 14%, as the terroir is expressed better.” Needless to say, Roulot’s 2011s lived up to my expectations as some of the finest white Burgundy wines in 2011, perhaps not quite right up with the very best I have encountered from this address, but utterly delicious and exquisitely crafted.

It has a scintillating, vibrant mineral-driven bouquet stylistically equidistant between Puligny and Meursault. The palate is extremely well-balanced with immense precision, starting off with real race and drive and then easing back toward the finish that offers just a touch of spice.

Many things during the season were similar to 2007: hot spring with early flowering; July not so good but flowering and harvest early. We began 24 August with the full team beginning on the 28 August. The 2011s have lower total acidity than 2010 but pH levels are a little better. Also, alcohol potential was around 0.8 degrees lower. I feel more comfortable with this level of alcohol, around 12.5%, than say 13.5% to 14%, as the terroir is expressed better.” Needless to say, Roulot’s 2011s lived up to my expectations as some of the finest white Burgundy wines in 2011, perhaps not quite right up with the very best I have encountered from this address, but utterly delicious and exquisitely crafted.

1561,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Porusots,"The 2007 Meursault 1er Cru Porusot cannot match the 2009 for complexity on the nose, with hints of undergrowth coming through. The palate is well-balanced with hints of wet wool on the entry, and as I suggested to Jean-Marc’s surprise, it is reminiscent of a fine Chenin Blanc with a bit of age. Very fine tension here with a touch of spice and ginger toward the composed, harmonious finish. Drink now-2022. 

Wine is full of hyperbole, now more than ever, but not with respect to the exceptional wines of Jean-Marc Roulot, a grower that has consistently wowed my palate for several years. Although I have met him intermittently in London, this was the first time I had visited his winery on the outskirts of Meursault, just up the road from Coche-Dury. I wonder if their geographical proximity has something to do with stylistic similarities between the two addresses since nobody captures mineralite like these two artisans. It was a good job I penciled in an appointment this week under clement skies. As we descend to his spotlessly clean, relatively capacious cellar he informs me that it was under several inches of water after the previous week’s deluges in late May. Jean-Marc is an engaging vigneron, as one might expect from the former professional actor. I should put that in the present tense since he was about to film a French drama in Beaune, playing a gendarme rather than a winemaker. We tasted a handful of slightly older wines before broaching the 2011s. Moving on to a comprehensive run through his 2011s that had been bottled between January and April, I asked him for his sentiment toward the growing season. “I feel positive toward the vintage after the 2010,” he enthused, “as it is always difficult after such a lauded vintage. The main factor is that in 2011 the grapes were healthy and everything was clean. This was not the case in 2010, which needed some sorting. Maybe the wines are not as powerful, but they are more elegant and precise with better terroir expression.

1562,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Blanc,The Bourgogne Blanc from Jean March Roulot has such a fragrant bouquet with scents of wet limestone and citrus peel that are understated but display great delineation. Honestly – you would not begrudge the aromatics if it were a Premier Cru! The palate is extremely well-balanced with brilliant delineation and perfectly judged acidity. The essence of mineralite filters down to this ridiculously fine generic white Burgundy. Tasted March 2013.,,RP (90-92)
1563,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Vireuils,"The Meursault les Vireuils ’10 possesses a show-stopping bouquet that is more reminiscent of say, a Puligny Cailleret, its rich precocious fruit not obfuscating its granitic personality. There is astonishing clarity on the palate that is delicate and pretty, subtle citrus and peach on the entry that segues into a more terse, slate-like finish. This is an outstanding Meursault that should evolve beautifully over the next 10 to 15 years.  Tasted March 2013.",,RP (90-92)
1564,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Meix Chavaux,"The 2009 Meix Chavaux, which lies downhill from Vireuils and Luchets, has a delicate flinty nose that is nicely defined, but if truth be told, I was anticipating a little more attach and vigor. The palate has an effervescent quality about it, beautifully poised with hints of freshly sliced apricot and a squeeze of lime. There is a lovely build in the mouth that goes some way to compensating for the aromatics. Very fine. Tasted March 2013.",,RP (90-92)
1565,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Meix Chavaux,"Compared to the ’09 tasted alongside, the 2004 Meix Chavaux seems a little muted on the nose with tertiary, almost undergrowth-like aromas. The nose is deceptive because the palate is vibrant and citrus-fresh – bright and animated with a tense, orange zest finish that leaves you satisfied. It almost feels like this is a two-track Meursault, the aromatics evolving with more alacrity than the palate! Tasted March 2013.",,RP (90-92)
1566,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"In 2010, the Meursault Charmes is defined by precision and cut. A pure, crystalline wine, it shows fabulous balance and tons of pedigree. White stone fruits, pears, apples and jasmine all come to life as the wine virtually sparkles on the palate with its irrepressible energy. The finish is exceptionally beautiful, polished and vibrant. This is one of the most taut, tense Charmes readers will come across. Roulot is quite candid in explaining that his location in Charmes is not optimal. Instead he believes organic farming, practiced here since 2000, is the main reason the Charmes is gaining in minerality as the years pass. Incidentally, Roulot made the same comment on the Meix Chevaux. Regardless, this is an utterly magnificent wine. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.

Jean-Marc Roulot commented that 2010 was easy in the vineyard but not so simple in the cellar, mostly because of very long malolactic fermentations that did not finish until the following August! The harvest started on September 17 and the wines came in with 12.8 -13.5 natural alcohols, which is at the higher end of the range for the domaine. Because of the lengthy malos, the 2010s were bottled a little later than normal. The 2010s are quite representative of the year in that they have considerable richness and at the same time high acidities. They are remarkably vivid, expressive to site and flat-out gorgeous. Readers will notice a new wine in 2010, the Auxey-Duresses, and can look forward to a new Clos de la Baronne and Clos des Boucheres with the 2011 vintage. Roulot fans will also want to be on the look out for Jean-Marc Roulot’s new line of eau de vies, an old family tradition that goes back many generations. The Framboise is one of the most pure expressions of fruit I have ever tasted, while the Abricot, made from Gerard and Jean-Louis Chave’s organically grown apricots in St. Joseph, is a bit more honeyed and liqueur-like.Unfortunately, my bottle of the Poire eau de vie broke, but I hope to be able to taste it soon.

1567,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The 2010 Meursault Perrieres wraps around the palate with huge, seamless layers of fruit. It boasts stunning textural depth and pure richness from start to finish. There is so much sheer intensity of the fruit that the minerality appears virtually hidden. Although the density of the fruit is impressive, this isn’t a particularly elegant or refined Perrieres by Roulot standards, at least not today. Roulot explains that the Perrieres was the last of his wines to finish its malolactic fermentation. In my view it is a bit heavy, although the truth is that most growers would kill to have a wine like this in their cellars. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.

1568,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Bouchères,"Roulot’s 2010 Meursault Boucheres comes across as weightless, perfumed and very beautiful. Floral aromatics lead to expressive stone fruits in this gracious, feminine wine. In 2010, the Boucheres is all subtlety, finesse and understatement. A distinctly salty finish full of tension and energy leaves a lasting impression. This is going to be a fascinating wine to follow over the coming years. The 2010 is the last Boucheres made by Roulot. As part of the purchase of Domaine Manuel, Jean-Marc Roulot acquired the 1.3 hectare Clos des Boucheres, and he prefers to focus his efforts there, as that plot is quite a bit larger than his existing holding in the greater Boucheres. Anticipated maturity: 2014+.

What is most impressive about the Tessons is the richness Roulot has achieved while avoiding any sense of heaviness. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.

This may need a number of years to show at its best, but it is stunningly beautiful. Anticipated maturity: 2017+.  

Jean-Marc Roulot is one of the most thoughtful, introspective growers in Burgundy, so it is hardly a surprise his 2009s are so sublime. The domaine has grown to 15 hectares as of the 2011 harvest.

Readers can look forward to two new wines from Roulot a Meursault Clos de la Baronne, Meursault Clos de Bouchere, plus a little more production of the Poruzots. Roulot was among the first to harvest, and started picking on September 1st. Accodring to Roulot, the optimal window for picking has become much narrower with today’s increasingly warmer growing seasons. Roulot told me he prefers 2009 to 2008 as the fruit was healthier, with no botrytis or other issues, which resulted in wines of greater focus. The 2009s spent 12 months in oak followed by 6 months in steel with very light and infrequent batonnage. The Bourgogne saw less than 10% new barrels, while the village wines saw 15-18% new barrels and the premier crus 25-30% new barrels. Unfortunately I was not able to taste the 2010s as they were in full malolactic fermentation.

This is not an immediate wine, but rather a bottle that will handsomely repay patience. I hope to have a chance to revisit this in a few years’ time, as it is nothing short of utterly profound.

1579,Domaine Roulot,Meursault À Mon Plaisir Clos du Haut Tesson,"The 2009 Meursault Les Tessons – Cuvee de Mon Plaisir is another of the riper, rounder wines in this lineup. It shows marvelous integrity and persistence all the way through to the creamy finish. Some of the tautness and minerality of the best wines is missing, but in exchange readers will be rewarded with an open, supple Meursault that will deliver immense pleasure with a minimum of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2013+.  

Jean-Marc Roulot is one of the most thoughtful, introspective growers in Burgundy, so it is hardly a surprise his 2009s are so sublime. The domaine has grown to 15 hectares as of the 2011 harvest. Roulot was among a group of investors including Dominique Lafon who purchased Domaine Rene Manuel from Laboure-Roi. Readers can look forward to two new wines from Roulot a Meursault Clos de la Baronne, Meursault Clos de Bouchere, plus a little more production of the Poruzots. Roulot was among the first to harvest, and started picking on September 1st. Accodring to Roulot, the optimal window for picking has become much narrower with today’s increasingly warmer growing seasons. Roulot told me he prefers 2009 to 2008 as the fruit was healthier, with no botrytis or other issues, which resulted in wines of greater focus.

Layers of warm, radiant fruit caress the palate in stunning style. Mineral notes appear on the finish, but the Luchets is essentially about fruit, within the context of Meursault, of course.

1583,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"The Roulot 2007 Meursault Perrieres is scented with musk, narcissus, heliotrope, grapefruit, white peach, moss, and white truffle. A terrific combination of luscious and vivacious citrus with satiny texture and underlying density of chalky minerality lends the palate richness and energy. Bitter elements of citrus rind and fruit pit are invigoratingly integrated. Toasted hazelnut, citrus oil, and hints of honey add to the allure of a finish impeccably transparent to mineral and floral nuances and uplifting in its combination of buoyancy and refreshing brightness. This should be worth following for 10-12 years. It was his last-bottled and for a long time least expressive 2007, says Roulot, but it is certainly overcome any reticence it might once have exhibited!

Jean-Marc Roulot as usual racked his 2007s back into tank one year after their early September harvest, then let them rest on their fine lees there for 5-6 months before bottling, believing – as did so many growers – that the 2007s needed time to evolve before bottling. He considers himself to have had an advantage this year due to his predominance of northerly, high-elevation sites that benefited from breezes to ward off rot, and especially able to benefit from the north wind that brought general drying and concentration at the beginning of September. Finished alcohols hover around 12.5, “and lower degrees are no handicap as far as I am concerned,” opines Roulot. Still, he acknowledges that perhaps he might have done well to hold off a few more days with the harvest in certain parcels.

1584,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Meix Chavaux,"Continuing downhill from Vireuils and Luchets, Roulot’s 2007 Meursault Meix Chavaux is overtly chalky as well as saline, with bright citrus akin to that of the Luchets and lemon pip and peach kernel whose bitterness adds to the wine’s sense of austerity. But this has a formidable sense of density, suggestions of ripe white peach, and an integrated sense to its citric, pit fruited, bitter, and stony aspects that engenders a vigorous counterpoint, carrying into a long, invigoratingly oscillating finish. I expect it will reward visits for another 6-8 years at least.

A musky floral and citrus oil aura hangs over the entire, elegant performance here. This should be well worth following for at least 6-8 years.

1586,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The Roulot 2007 Meursault Charmes smells alluringly of buddleia, citrus zest, and ginger; pours forth refreshing lemon and lime, projecting a vigorous image; and offers crushed stone and salt in support of a sense of underlying density. This spare, bright representation of its cru is impressively long-lined and persistent and should be well worth following for at least 6-8 years, perhaps in the process demonstrating the extra measure of complexity that should mark the transition in this collection to premier cru.  This was much more expressive in tank, indicates Roulot.

1587,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"From neighboring to Vireuils, Roulot’s 2007 Meursault Luchets displays a briny, nutty, faintly sweaty and reductive nose. Explosively bright and citric on the palate, and with a sense of density you can strain through your teeth, this at the same time this introduces a faintly lactic note, and finishes with a persistence of briny mineral character adumbrated in the nose. My suspicion is that this just needs a short time in bottle to gain in clarity and for its parts to integrate. It certainly looks to have at least half a dozen years’ potential.

It is also decidedly spare in its mineral and citrus (lime, grapefruit) emphasis, yet there’s vibrant primary fruit acidity and a hint of creaminess of texture. Citrus zest, milled grain, stones and salt inform a lean but juicy, bright finish. While less charming for now than the Bourgogne, it should prove worth re-visiting over at least the next 3-4 years.

There is an invigorating sense of interplay between mineral and fruit elements here, carrying in to a finish of considerable. As there are 20,000 bottles of this, it can serve as a very fine calling card for Roulot‘s and the vintage’s style. I would plan to enjoy it over the next 2-3 years.

1590,Domaine Roulot,Meursault 1er Cru Perrières,"Roulot’s 2006 Meursault Perrieres offers an effusively floral nose and opulently ripe pit fruit flavors playing against saline, savory as well as crushed stone suggestions of minerality. With outstanding concentration and a polished texture, this offers  a truly dynamic interplay of flavors, finishing with a refreshing and invigorating meld of high-toned herbal and floral essences, vivacious citricity, fresh pit fruits, and wet stone. As fine as it is, this 2006 will not achieve the complexity or aging potential of the wonderfully layered, rich, mysteriously mineral, savory 2005 – one of the finest white Burgundies of its vintage.

Actor-vigneron Jean-Marc Roulot bottles 16 different wines (all but three of them white) from his roughly 25 acres of vines. A partisan of clarity, finesse, and mineral expression, he began picking in haste four days before the ban de vendange. Roulot professes a preference for the style of 2004 (“It has an energy I adore,” he says) or 2005. Yet an excellent case can be made – and I think these wines eloquently make it – for the felicitous marriage of 2006 vintage richness and generosity with Roulot’s brand of restraint and his desire to bring out the details and fine points of differentiation between sites. And Roulot is surely the unchallenged master when it comes to unlocking the potential in a wide array of non-premier cru Meursault vineyards (albeit at premier cru prices). The best of these wines – as my notes below testify – are quite unlike others from their vintage. Roulot uses a high percentage of larger barrels, and racks his wines into tank for an extended period, which is the condition in which I last tasted them.

Subtle creaminess and nut paste flavors offer lovely contrast with the wine’s persistent citricity and tart pit fruit character, and there is a combination of citrus and savory salinity that really calls for the saliva, not to mention the next sip.

With unusual firmness of feel and a brash, chalky, pungent finish, this is Meursault in a different key from the others in Roulot’s collection.

Yet an excellent case can be made – and I think these wines eloquently make it – for the felicitous marriage of 2006 vintage richness and generosity with Roulot’s brand of restraint and his desire to bring out the details and fine points of differentiation between sites. And Roulot is surely the unchallenged master when it comes to unlocking the potential in a wide array of non-premier cru Meursault vineyards (albeit at premier cru prices). The best of these wines – as my notes below testify – are quite unlike others from their vintage. Roulot uses a high percentage of larger barrels, and racks his wines into tank for an extended period, which is the condition in which I last tasted them.

1598,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Luchets,"From just below the Vireuils, Roulot’s 2006 Meursault Luchets suggests lime chiffon in its combination of citrus, subtle creaminess, and wafting levity. Bitterness of citrus zest and fruit pits along with brown spices and juicy grapefruit and lime lend this an invigorating cast, but that does not mean it lacks for richness. I imagine it evolving interestingly for at least 4-6 years.  The sweetly floral, honeyed 2005 outclasses this 2006 by dint of its clarity, refinement, and mineral persistence.

1599,Domaine Roulot,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"From just beyond the Meursault appellation, Roulot’s 2006 Bourgogne displays a balance of clarity and refreshment with creaminess of texture that sets the tone for this entire collection. Fetching aromas of orange blossom, honeysuckle, cherry and vanilla lead into a bitter-sweet set of flavors with admirable persistence. Those who cannot afford a Roulot Meursault can relish this excellent example of his handiwork, which also happens to represent one of his largest lots.

1600,Domaine Roulot,Meursault Les Narvaux,"Roulot cautions that his 2006 Meursault Narvaux – from a property he acquired only in 2004 – has not benefited from his vineyard regimen for long enough to fit in with his collection, and indeed while this is ample and ripe, with distinctive alkaline mineral notes, and admirable sheer persistence, it lacks the definition, elegance, or energy of the other wines here today. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, it ought to be worth following for a few years in bottle.

The three best Meursaults from Roulot are generally Les Tessons, Les Charmes, and Les Perrieres.  Roulot's father Guy always adored Les Tessons, stating on the label, the Clos de Mon Plaisir.  This wine is usually an opulent, medium to full-bodied, classic example of the appellation.  The 1992 Meursault-Les Perrieres possesses that exquisite steely, mineral-scented nose combined with aromas of apple blossoms, ripe fruit, and medium to full body.  There is zesty acidity, and plenty of richness and length.

1695,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2020 Échézeaux Grand Cru has turned out just as well in bottle as I hoped it might. Unusually muscular and concentrated for this bottling, it unwinds in the glass with aromas of mulberries and blackberries mingled with orange zest and exotic spices, framed by a deft touch of new oak. Full-bodied, broad and velvety, with a deep core of fruit framed by rich, powdery tannins, it concludes with a long, expansive finish.",,RP 98
1696,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet,"The 2020 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet is largely derived from a younger vine parcel of La Tâche, planted in 1998, that's complemented by some young vines in Grands-Échézeaux. Bursting with aromas of sweet wild berries, exotic spices and classy new oak, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a layered, concentrated mid-palate that's built around powdery tannins and vibrant acids. Flamboyant but nicely balanced, this is a real success in 2020.",,RP 98
1697,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2018 Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru is a rich, muscular wine, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cherries, sweet berries, red fruit compote and plums mingled with subtle hints of exotic spices and peonies. Full-bodied, fleshy and broad-shouldered, with an ample core of fruit, powdery tannins, ripe acids and a long, heady finish. Out of the gates, the 2018 is something of a fruit bomb, but with time it should metabolize that puppy fat to become something special.",,RP 98
1698,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"A broad, muscular wine, the 2009 Montrachet Grand Cru delivers a rich bouquet of honeyed orchard fruit, tangerine oil, toasted nuts and baking spices. Full-bodied, fleshy and layered, with a concentrated core of fruit and considerable mid-palate weight, it's dramatic and expansive, gaining in vivacity with time in the glass. Surely one of the most powerful white Burgundies produced in this vintage, it is aging with grace and offers compelling drinking today.",,RP 98
1699,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1996 Richebourg Grand Cru is drinking beautifully and might actually surpass La Tâche in this vintage; certainly, I have yet to drink a 1996 La Tâche as good as this particular bottle of Richebourg. Wafting from the glass with an inviting bouquet of plummy fruit mingled with wilted rose petals, peonies, exotic spices, orange rind and forest floor, it's full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with none of the vintage's tendency toward asperity in evidence, exhibiting melting tannins and a seamless, velvety profile. This is really beginning to show well today.",,RP 98
1700,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"While the 2017 La Tâche Grand Cru is one of the most approachable recent vintages of this great monopole, it's still really too soon to be opening bottles. However, these things happen, and it's certainly a striking wine, unwinding in the glass with detailed aromas of wild berries, plums, exotic spices, orange, rose petals, peony and coniferous forest floor. Full-bodied, satiny and seamless, its beautifully refined tannins and succulent acids are cloaked in an ample core of fruit. Like many of the best 2017s, its charm is deceptive, as there's a lot waiting in reserve here, and even a few years' patience will bear dividends.",,RP 98
1701,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"This impeccably cellared bottle of the 1959 La Tâche Grand Cru had never left Burgundy, and it underlined the importance of provenance for wines of this age: while some reports suggest that this wine is tiring, this example was at its absolute zenith. Soaring from the glass with a deep and profound bouquet of raspberries, cherries and plum preserve mingled with notions of Asian spice, candied peel, musk and peonies, the wine is full-bodied, textural and enveloping, with an abundance of opulent fruit that's the vintage's calling card, underpinned by velvety tannins and ripe acids. The 1959 is an exquisite, sensual La Tâche, and this bottle (number 15768) numbered among the most thrilling wines I drank in 2019.",,RP 98
1702,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aromas of crisp green pear, citrus oil, mandarin, fresh pastry, clear honey and oak vanillin introduce the 2017 Montrachet Grand Cru, a full-bodied, deep and textural wine that's voluminous and powerful but incisive, with racy structuring acids and a long, chalky and elegantly honeyed finish. ""If we had tried to conceive of the ideal Montrachet, we might have imagined something like this,"" admits Bertrand de Villaine, and the 2017 certainly numbers among the finest renditions of this iconic bottling over the last decade and beyond.",,RP 98
1703,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"Wafting from the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of dark wild berries, cassis, wilted rose petals, blood orange, exotic spices, licorice and coniferous forest floor, the 2017 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is full-bodied, satiny textured and multidimensional. It's just as powerful as this year's La Tâche but even more elegantly framed by filigree structure, concluding with an intensely sapid and penetratingly fragrant finish. Pristinely balanced, this young Romanée-Conti possesses huge reserves for the long haul despite its deceptively supple youthful appeal, and it will reward extended bottle age.",,RP 98
1704,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2017 Richebourg Grand Cru offers up generous aromas of ripe strawberries, raspberries, cinnamon and coniferous forest floor, framed by a lavish application of creamy new oak that's less immediately integrated than in the Domaine's other wines at this early stage. On the palate, the Richebourg is full-bodied, rich and multidimensional, with a lavishly enveloping attack and supple structuring tannins that are almost entirely concealed by its deep core of fruit. Long and sapid, this is a spectacular wine in the making.",,RP 98
1705,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2017 Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru was also showing very well indeed, soaring from the glass with scents of cassis, violets, blood orange, cinnamon and espresso roast that are complemented by carnal nuances of smoked duck and musk. On the palate, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and enveloping, with terrific concentration, rich and powdery structuring tannins and a long, saline finish. This is a dramatic, head-turning Romanée-St-Vivant in the making, and it is showing even better in bottle than it did from barrel.",,RP 98
1706,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"More brooding and reserved than the Échézeaux that preceded it in the tasting, the 2017 Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with an enticing bouquet of cassis, blackberries, blood orange, exotic spices and musk. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a more introverted, structured profile than the Échézeaux, its considerable reserves of concentrated fruit framed by an abundance of powdery tannin and succulent acids. Long and penetrating, this will reward sustained bottle age. The Grands Échézeaux was picked on September 12.",,RP 98
1707,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The flamboyant 2017 Échézeaux Grand Cru is especially good this year, bursting from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of wild berries, rose petals, cinnamon, smoked duck and Asian spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, supple and velvety, with an expansive attack and superb depth and amplitude, its fleshy core of fruit framed by fine, melting tannins. Reminiscent of a modern-day version of the Domaine's 1985 Échézeaux, this is another 2017 that has gained appreciably with its final months of élevage. Picked on the 18th, this was where the estate's harvest concluded.",,RP 98
1708,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton Grand Cru is performing beautifully from bottle, bursting from the glass with a captivating bouquet of peonies, rose hips, sweet red berries, orange rind, spices and subtle soil tones. On the palate, the wine medium to full-bodied, supple and velvety, with succulent acids, good concentration and a long, exquisitely perfumed finish. Indeed, it's only by comparison with the domaine's utterly suave wines from Vosne-Romanée later in the tasting that this Corton's tannins seem comparatively coarse-grained. Picked on September 4th, it is showing appreciably better than it did when I tasted it from tank before bottling last year.",,RP 98
1709,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2016 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is a worthy successor to the profound 2015, wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, violets, peony, dark chocolate, cinnamon and exotic spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and satiny, with an ineffable sense of completeness, searing concentration without weight, a vibrant, indeed animating line of acidity, and a long, expansive finish that concludes with a judicious touch of mouthwatering bitterness. Wines like this are the foundation of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's reputation.",,RP 98
1710,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"More reserved than the Richebourg and Romanée-St-Vivant, the 2016 La Tâche Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with aromas of wild berries, licorice, rose petal, smoked duck and love, framed by a touch of cedary new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and velvety, with a deep, concentrated but tight-knit core, its firm chassis of fine-grained, structuring tannins cloaked in succulent fruit, underpinned by juicy acids. The finish is long and reverberative. This is a stunning La Tâche in the making, but it is also one of the more reticent wines in the range and will demand some bottle age.",,RP 98
1711,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Broader-shouldered and ampler than the Romanée-St-Vivant, the 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru unfurls in the glass with a lavish bouquet of cassis, dark plums, candied peel, potpourri, Asian spices, peonies and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and expansive, with considerable depth and dimension at the core, and a gourmand, almost fleshy profile that marries beautifully with its cool, precise fruit tones and its velvety structuring tannins. This is a superb Richerbourg that to my palate surpasses the 2015 rendition.",,RP 98
1712,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2016 Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru is super, bursting from the glass with a kaleidoscopic bouquet of potpourri, red berries, cassis, peony and rose petal. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and fine-boned, with tangy acids, superb concentration and an ample chassis of powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long, fragrant finish. This is a Romanée-St-Vivant that exemplifies the intensity without the weight that distinguishes the Domaine's best wines, and it equals the fabulous 2015 rendition.",,RP 98
1713,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"Surpassing the 2015 rendition, the 2016 Corton Grand Cru is the finest wine that the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti has produced to date from the holdings of Prince Florent de Mérode. Wafting from the glass with notes of cassis, currant leaf, raspberries and menthol, discretely framed by new wood, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and intense, gaining in depth and dimension as it sits in the glass, with tangy underpinning acids and powdery tannins, culminating in a long finish. Aubert de Villaine recounted that the Domaine replanted a third of Corton-Bressandes while also grafting over the Mérodes' young vines to their own massal selections of Pinot Fin. While this is built for four decade's evolution in the cellar, the balance and concentration are such that it could be drunk with pleasure in its youth.",,RP 98
1714,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2009 La Tâche Grand Cru is still a decade away from the plenitude of maturity, but it's already a head-turning wine, soaring from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of rose petal, Asian spices, grilled meats, rock salt, espresso roast, rich soil tones, plums and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and richly structured around fine-grained chalky tannins, with a deep and multidimensional core and succulent underlying acids, concluding with a long, fragrant finish. This is an utterly classic La Tâche that ranks among the vintage's high points.",,RP 98
1715,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's 1994 La Tâche Grand Cru does not transcend the limitations of this challenging vintage, offering up a rather pedestrian bouquet of red-black fruit and licorice, becoming more and more dominated by its lavish application of high-quality new oak as it sits in the glass and never revealing any of the aromatic drama of which La Tâche is capable. On the palate, the wine is chunky and foursquare, with bright acids and a certain tannic asperity that suggests this is unlikely to change in any critical respect in the foreseeable future.",,RP 98
1716,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru is still predictably youthful, unfurling in the glass with aromas of crisp Anjou pear, buttered citrus, tangerine oil and a prominent framing of very classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and concentrated, both satiny and textural without being remotely unctuous, and underpinned by succulent, even tangy acids. At this stage, where the wine really shows its pedigree is in its extraordinarily long, oak-inflected finish. Given the vintage, one might have expected more ripeness and drama, but the domaine is picking its Montrachet a bit earlier these days, and that has done it no harm at all in 2015. It would be interesting to taste this wine alongside Ramonet's example, which is both more textural and less overtly oaky, but my sense is that the two are on the same qualitative level in their very different styles.",,RP 98
1717,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is one of the pinnacles of this great red Burgundy vintage, opening in the glass to reveal a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, notes of raspberry and red plum mingling with rose petal, peony, blood orange and spice. On the palate, the wine is silky, medium to full-bodied and stunningly complete, its supremely elegant tannins entirely cloaked in pristinely delicate red fruit. Despite its incredible concentration and persistence, this Romanée-Conti is utterly weightless, and its effortless harmony and unremitting finish preclude any argument about its benchmark quality. Cropped at 22 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 10.",,RP 98
1718,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2015 La Tâche Grand Cru is a young classic, soaring from the glass with an exotic and stunningly complex bouquet of dark berries, plums, hoisin, smoked duck, dark chocolate, licorice and Chinese five spice, with just a touch of rose hip on the upper register. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and authoritative, with more mid-palate depth than the Richebourg, its attack more textural and layered. The tannins here are fine grained but firm—swathed in an ample core of plummy, almost savory fruit—and the finish is long and scintillating. Cropped at 25 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 7 and 8.",,RP 98
1719,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru is very good indeed, offering up a pure and surprisingly expressive nose of strawberry, dried rose, plum preserve, roast squab, raw cocoa and incipient rich soil tones, framed by some nutty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and rich, sweet fruit playing in counterpoint with sapid, savory nuance. This Richebourg is denser at the core and less expansive than the corresponding Romanée-St-Vivant, and though the grain of its tannins is similar, their impact is more assertive and muscular. Cropped at 24 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 8 and 9.",,RP 98
1720,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti 2015 Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru was showing superbly from bottle, bursting from the glass with a dramatic and expressive bouquet of rose petal, violet, raspberry and spicy red cherry that has already digested its framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, expansive and supple, its frame of fine-grained tannins cloaked in a deep core of vibrant fruit and only asserting themselves on the long, penetrating finish. This is a superb Romanée-St-Vivant that nips on the heels of the fabulous Richebourg this year. Cropped at 26 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 9, 10 and 11.",,RP 98
1721,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2015 Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru is more brooding and reserved than the Échézeaux, opening in the glass with notes of raspberry, plum preserve, currant leaf, blood orange, hints of the forest floor to come and, again, a rich framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with notable structural amplitude and a long, authoritative and firmly tannic finish. This is always a wine that takes a long time to show all its cards, and the 2015 is no exception, but the raw materials indicate that patience will bear dividends. Cropped at 30 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 11 and 12.",,RP 98
1722,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"After the more restrained Corton, the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's 2015 Échézeaux Grand Cru bursts from the glass with a flamboyant bouquet of mulberry, black cherry, wood smoke and a lavish framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and intense, with a classically firm chassis of tannin and a lovely core of sappy, succulent fruit. This was the last of DRC's vineyards to be harvested, but despite its overtly ripe aromas and flavors, it retains superb acidity and focus and should amply reward cellaring. Cropped at 26 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 12 and 14.",,RP 98
1723,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1990 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti continues to cruise along, blossoming in the glass with a lavish bouquet of black cherry, blackberry, sous bois, dark spice and a touch of game. On the palate, the wine is ample and full-bodied, with a chassis of fine, melted tannins—though just a few rough edges poke out on the finish (a function of arrested phenolic maturity?)—enrobed in juicy, vibrant fruit that lingers through the long and penetrating finish. Bottle number 7492.",,RP 98
1724,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"From a cold Burgundian cellar, the 1972 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti put in a very creditable showing in this vintage, especially as the 1970s were not particularly distinguished years at the Domaine. Aromas of macerated red fruits, dried rose petal, raw cocoa and savory bass notes precede a medium-full wine with melted tannins, a glossy core of cool fruit, tangy acids and a sapid, saline finish. In this era, DRC bottled barrel-by-barrel, and I’m guessing this bottle hailed from one of the good ones.",,RP 98
1725,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was cropped at seven hectoliters per hectare, and it handles the sway of the barrel in superior fashion to that of the Echezeaux, at least at the moment. There is crisp blackberry and bilberry fruit, fine mineralité and a whiff of wild heather and drizzly moorland. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grained tannin. It is underpinned by crisp acidity, and here I discerned more red fruit vis-à-vis the Echézeaux, blessed with a tender but sustained and poised finish. This is classy, and I suspect this year, a step up from the Echézeaux.",,RP 98
1726,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Echezeaux Grand Cru was cropped at just six hectoliters per hectare because of the frost, which equates to just 12 barrels. I felt that the new oak came a little more strongly through the aromatics and rather obstructed the terroir expression at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with quite conspicuous oak: firm tannins that encase dark berry fruit, a touch of orange rind and then a tang of black pepper on the finish. I await to see if this will subsume the oak during the remainder of its barrel maturation, whether when tasted it was the closing winter months accentuating the wood or a factor of such a low quantity of production. Let’s see.",,RP 98
1727,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2008 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was served by Aubert de Villaine at the annual Musique et Vin festival at Clos de Vougeot, never having been commercially released by the domaine. Slightly deeper in color than I expected, it sported a distinct reductive nose that I thought worked quite well: vibrant and focused, just the right amount of struck-match scent without becoming overbearing. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, again quite reductive in style but with attractive orange peel and walnut notes toward the finish. Just a delicious, if ridiculously unobtainable, wine! Tasted June 2017.",,RP 98
1728,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"I have never been a fan of the domaine's 1989s, and the 1989 La Tâche Grand Cru is no exception. Now showing some bricking on the rim, it has a rather herbaceous and earthy nose, a little muddled compared to superior vintages such as 1991. There is a subtle ferrous note, later a slight vegetal scent. The palate is rustic with furry tannin, moderate acidity and weight but clearly missing the finesse and the sophistication that you normally find on a La Tâche. It sort of ""stumbles"" over the finish line. It's not a bad Burgundy for the vintage, but it is not a great La Tâche. Tasted June 2017.",,RP 98
1729,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru was picked on 19 September, cropped at 32.6 hectoliters per hectare and bottled on 25 and 26 April 2016. I remember tasting this from barrel, thinking how taciturn it was, before coaxing out those subtle tertiary aromas. Here it remains bashful once more, however, it soon begins to open and deliver the ethereal, mineral-infused red fruit. It is almost conservative compared to the more multi-faceted 2014 La Tâche. This is precise and detailed, not inclined to deliver aromatic ""thrills"" at such an early juncture. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, perfectly judged acidity, perhaps fuller in the mouth than the 2013 Romanée-Conti, with volume and grip towards the finish. Paradoxically, it is also a discrete wine, quite linear and maybe without the sustained persistence that elevates the La Tâche. You could sum up this Romanée-Conti in three words: precision, precision, precision. A total of 657 cases were produced, which is much above the average of 450, but do not expect the normal economic rules of supply and demand to apply. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1730,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru was picked on 20 and 21 September at 29.75 hectoliters per hectare. This has a gorgeous, flamboyant, vivacious bouquet with blossoming red cherries, crushed strawberry, less undergrowth scents compared to the showing in barrel, replaced by pressed rose petal notes. There is wonderful delineation and exuberance here. The palate is medium-bodied with a lively, spicy, white pepper-tinged entry, just a faint hint of black truffle tincturing the dark berry fruit. There is superb backbone and density here, a Richebourg delivering on its promise from barrel, plus it comes armed with an extraordinarily long aftertaste that evokes marine-like images, something wild and estuarine. While not as flattering as the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment, just wait ten years. 1,160 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1731,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2014 La Tâche Grand Cru was picked on 17, 18 and 20 September at 32 hectoliters per hectare, bottled between 1 and 25 April 2016. It has a quite startling bouquet: dark berry fruit, bay leaf, hints of jasmine tea and autumn leaves. It delivers multi-faceted aromatics, a mercurial bouquet, brown spices emerging with continued aeration in the glass. It is a tad more forward than I expected. The palate is medium-bodied with great structure and fine grip. This is a slightly more masculine La Tâche and replicating its performance in barrel, the fruit spectrum shimmies from red to black (incidentally, exactly as I observed when I tasted it in barrel). There is a lovely lift on the finish that leaves you with a piquant kiss on the cheek. This is wonderful. 1,929 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1732,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was picked on 21, 22 and 23 September cropped at 31.6 hectoliters per hectare. Now this has a distinctly earthy bouquet, one that leads you into the dark woods. Yes, there is plenty of vivacious red berry fruit, here augmented with something autumnal, brown leaves on an October morning, moss and tree bark. Then with continued aeration, these shift away and are replaced by pure floral aromas. The palate is very precise on the entry with a touch of orange rind and mandarin complementing the crushed strawberry and raspberry fruit; there is a touch of spiciness towards the finish that exerts a gentle, yet insistent grip à la Richebourg. The persistence here is very impressive and it just seems to blossom in the glass until you have utterly succumbed to its charms. 1,756 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1733,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on 23 and 24 September at 32.5 hectoliters per hectare. Slightly deeper in color compared to the 2014 Echézeaux, it is undeniably a tangible step up in intensity and complexity, offering disarming raspberry, crushed strawberry, and crushed limestone that almost verges on flintiness. It has beguiling purity and focus. The palate is medium-bodied with a noticeably grippy entry. It has a strong saline seam, structured but not a dense Grands Echézeaux. It gently fans out on the finish with pretty, mineral-soaked red fruit, although the aftertaste is not as prolonged as some of the greatest vintages I have tasted from this esteemed vineyard. Nevertheless, it remains a supremely gifted wine that will bestow two, possibly three decades of drinking pleasure. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1734,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on 24, 25 and 26 September at 27.8 hectoliters per hectare. It offers an expressive bouquet, more vivacious than the 2012 Echézeaux, with scents of black plum, raspberry preserve and subtle limestone aromas. It unfolds with confidence in the glass. The palate is surprisingly structured on the entry, perhaps with ambitions towards its elder brother, the Grands Echézeaux. There is a gentle, slightly leafy quality to this Grand Cru, perhaps more masculine and reserved than other vintages tasted just after bottling. The aftertaste feels long with a cheeky pinch of black pepper. Probably one of the most approachable 2014s from the domaine, and just as likely to be drunk too young! 1,443 cases produced.",,RP 98
1735,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Grand Cru was picked on 16 September at 25 hectoliters per hectare. It has a beguiling bouquet with wonderful lift and transparency: morello cherry, crushed strawberry, a touch of orange blossom, aromas that are beautifully defined. The palate is well balanced with a little chalkiness on the entry. It is brimming with quite feisty tart red fruit, a little spicier than previous vintages. The finish is elegant and refined, not as complex as I suspect the 2015 Corton will eventually become, yet there is wonderful harmony and mineralité in situ. One of the more ""airy"" Cortons from the domaine. 483 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
1736,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The last time that I drank the 1990 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was at the domaine in 2010. Five years on it remains a lovely Richebourg. Clear and quite deep in color, the bouquet remains ""ethereal"" with crushed strawberries and pomegranate fruit intermixed with iron, black truffle and a touch of pain d'épices. It is understated at first ,but after 30 minutes it had manifested the sense of grandeur you expect from a Richebourg. The palate is beautifully balanced with great depth and volume. There is that hint of black truffle coming through once more, as well as sour cherries, a hint of blueberry and an almost viscous, decadent finish that not so much caresses the sense but gives it a good ""seeing to."" This is probably the best bottle that I have tasted, and it should have another 20-30 years of pleasure to give. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
1737,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I have never been convinced by the performance of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti in this year and the 1989 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru did nothing but reinforce that view. Stalky and rather disjointed on the nose, the stem addition here seems to jar against the fruit rather than complement it. Rasping? The palate is medium-bodied, rustic and with a gritty texture. Masculine and firm in the mouth, it falls a long way short of the wines produced nowadays and the chewy finish feels coarse and attenuated. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
1738,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 1978 La Tâche Grand Cru is admittedly a wine that I have always wanted to taste, just the stratospheric price tag prohibiting me from doing so...until now, thanks to the generosity of my host rather than me winning the lottery. My expectations were understandably sky high given the reputation, but I was not disappointed because it lived up to everything I hoped for. Mature in color with wide bricking on the rim, the nose is utterly bewitching with fragrant scents of orange peel, iron piping, damp undergrowth, wild mushroom and a hint of dried blood. It felt intense yet beautifully defined. The palate felt fully mature after 38 years, the tannins completely melted. While there is not the weight of the 1978 Romanée-Conti, there is a sense of presence and grandeur imbued by this La Tâche. The balance is perfect, the symmetry beguiling, and it gently fans out on the pure, caressing finish. It offers everything you could wish from a mature Pinot Noir, a hauntingly beautiful wine that I shall remember for a very long time. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
1739,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 1976 La Tâche Grand Cru is a vintage that I have only encountered once before. This bottle replicated the first. It has a lovely, quite spicy bouquet with scents of warm bricks and peat, fine delineation although not as much fruit as say, the 1978 that I had tasted a few weeks previously (yeah...lucky sod). The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and sensual in texture with a fine bead of acidity. Granted, it is not a complex La Tâche and the growing season bestowed a gaminess that comes through a little more obviously than the previous bottle. Yet for the vintage this has lasted very well and though it will not improve, it should hold in there for another 6-8 years before gently fading. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
1740,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1971 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru is a wine that I have tasted a handful of times; this a vintage where the wines excelled (not until 1978 was that the case again). Here the bottle was similar in color to previous encounters with quite a broad degradation. The bouquet is fresh and lively with that brambly red fruit, orange peel and wild heather (yes - I wrote exactly the same descriptors as last time without any previous recall!). The palate conveys wonderful energy, a purring motor here, poised and transparent. It gently unfolds—such a nuanced Grands Echézeaux that paradoxically leaves a deep impression. Outstanding. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 98
1741,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1971 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was poured from magnum. It had a powerful, almost burly bouquet as you would expect from this vineyard—perhaps autumnal, brown leaves and a cold Sunday afternoon, touches of Earl Grey infused the dark berry fruit (darker than the 1971 Grands Echézeaux tasted alongside incidentally). The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity, hints of dried orange peel infusing the black and red fruit, all with impressive energy considering that this is now the same age as yours truly. Perhaps I found more breeding on the aforementioned Grands Echézeaux, and yet this is still a gorgeous mature Burgundy that will continue to give immense pleasure over the next decade for those privileged with the experience. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
1742,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"This bottle of 1961 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru came directly from the domaine's cellars. While the 1961 vintage is not as revered as the 1962s from the domaine, the handful that I have tasted have all been outstanding. This was no different. It has a haunting bouquet with breathtaking delineation and purity. It is like inhaling an intoxicating perfume and you had to just pause and reflect upon its almost ineffable complexity. The bouquet...enveloped you. The palate displayed exquisite balance. No, not a powerful Romanée-Conti but the epitome of elegance and refinement without shortchanging you on presence and intensity. There is even a slight rusticity detected on the finish, a little coarseness to the texture, no doubt emblematic of the time, although you perceive that as simply part of its character. It is a truly wondrous wine. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
1743,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1996 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru continues to be an absolutely delightful wine from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and puts to rest memories of a sub-par bottle tasted blind several years ago. Now two decades old, it retains a healthy color with little sign of ageing. The bouquet is fresh and vital, angular at first yet seeming to gain harmony with each swirl of the glass. It is not intense, but prioritizes clarity and tension over power. Dark berry fruit emerge first, briary and Vervain tea, an underlying mineralité eventually coming forth. The palate is very well balanced, quite linear and certainly not flamboyant or flattering. It makes you, the taster, work to seek out its nuances, its energy and refinement. Hints of black cherry intermingle with a marine-like undertow that governs that finish. It does not posses huge depth and I think Aubert de Villaine makes a more sophisticated wine nowadays, but it remains a joy. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
1744,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2013 La Tâche Grand Cru was picked from the afternoon of October 7 and over the next two days at 18 hectoliters per hectare. It has a heavenly nose with exquisite mineral-rich red cherry, wild strawberry, blood orange and subtle woodland, damp autumn leaf and moss aromas that are extraordinarily complex. It seems to gain vigor and intensity with each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, a slightly suppler La Tâche compared to recent years, a wine with an athleticism. There is nothing wasted or superfluous here, a honed La Tâche that is all about tensile structure matched by perfect acidity and an incredibly complex, kaleidoscopic finish that seems so mercurial in the glass, initially offering red fruit then changing its mind and revealing darker and more tertiary notes. In a word: awesome. Production is 1,023 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1745,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru was picked in the afternoon of October 8 at a yield of 17.5 hectoliters per hectare. I remember this was taciturn in barrel vis-à-vis the La Tâche, which is commonly the case, however here it sprints from the blocks thanks to a life-affirming bouquet of red plum, wild strawberry, cold wet limestone and black truffle that segues into something almost girolles-like, even smoky. Like the 2013 La Tâche, it is very mercurial in the glass and to that end, I stretched my sample out for 10-15 minutes. The palate is medium-bodied and very harmonious on the entry. Filigree tannin frame this wine, perfect acidity lending freshness and tension, here a gradual build towards a delineated, almost edgy finish. It brought to the forefront of my mind an actor about to utter the first line of a play. Give it several years in bottle before you start throwing bouquets onto the stage, for the performance will be worth the wait. Production is 312 cases. Tasted February 2016. ",,RP 98
1746,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru was harvested on the afternoon of October 9 and then the following day at just 16.5 hectoliters per hectare, the second lowest after the Echézeaux. It is clearly the elder brother of the 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant with intense dark cherry, black plum, tayberry and crushed violet aromas (the latter, perhaps a nod to the Romanée-Saint-Vivant). As with all the domaine's wines this year, it is beautifully defined with beguiling transparency. The palate is medium-bodied, but there is serious weight and presence here. It is struck through with sorbet-like freshness, hints of blood orange tincturing the vibrant red fruit, seguing into a finish with great conviction and confidence, a Richebourg self-aware though not preening about its status. This is a Richebourg to cellar for several years and to enjoy over the next 20 to 25 years (or more). Production is 551 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1747,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was picked on the afternoon of October 10 and then the following day, cropped at 17.5 hectoliters per hectare. The bouquet is adorable, so pure and comely, with shimmering red cherries, raspberry and orange blossom, a suggestion of cold flint imparting an enigmatic element—a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that is clearly going to bide its time. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin, impressive weight and almost a surfeit of freshness. There is tension from start to finish that effortlessly disguises the weight, the penetration on the sustained finish. What a wonderful wine from the domaine. Production is 847 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1748,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on the afternoon of October 6 and then the following morning, the yield delivering 21.5 hectoliters per hectare, higher than the Echézeaux. It has a vivid bouquet of Morello cherry, strawberry, crushed stone and just a touch of wilted rose petal, all beautifully defined and seeming to gain intensity in the glass. The palate is extremely well balanced and the acidity is well judged. There are earthy tones present, a hint of autumn woodland, a subtle but very attractive leafiness embroidered into the fruit. This is a very typical Grands Echézeaux, perhaps a little introspective compared to the more outgoing Echézeaux, but there is considerable length. Production is 782 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1749,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on October 12 and the following day (in the afternoon, if you want specifics!). Cropped at 15.5 hectoliters per hectare, the lowest of all the domaine's 2013s, it has a fragrant Morello cherry, crushed strawberry-scented bouquet that is precise and nicely focused, if lacking the horsepower of a more benevolent growing season. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp red cherry and strawberry fruit on the entry. Fresh and poised, I am impressed by the weight shown on the mid-palate, so much so that you might be deceived into mistaking it for the Grands Echézeaux or even the Richebourg, albeit on a less scale. There is just a dash of spice towards the finish as it gently fans out and leaves you satisfied. ""A quite ambitious Echézeaux in the making,"" I remarked out of barrel. I would not alter that view now that this lovely Echézeaux is in bottle. Production is 715 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1750,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton Grand Cru was picked on October 3 at an average yield of 19.5 hectoliters per hectare. It has a light blueberry and crushed strawberry-scented bouquet that does not quite possess the intensity of the 2013 Echézeaux. There is a hint of fresh fig that emerges with time in the glass. The palate is clean and fresh. There is something almost ""airy"" about this Le Corton, with pitch perfect acidity and perhaps more transparency than I have observed in earlier vintages. It does not boast great density and fruit concentration on the finish, and perhaps it is just deprived the substance that a more benevolent season would have bestowed. Nevertheless, it is a delicious, almost easy-drinking little ingénue of a Corton that will give much drinking pleasure over the next 12-15 years. Production is 461 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
1751,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2002 Romanée Saint Vivant from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti has a heavenly bouquet. It was served blind but the tangible stem addition betrayed the grower, particularly when it was later compared next to an Henri Jayer. The bouquet is very complex with red berries, tree bark, a touch of dried blood and smoke, but what is striking is the delineation. The palate is medium-bodied and as you would expect, extremely well balanced. There is plenty of sappy red fruit here suffused with sage and rosemary, a touch of spice enlivening a finish that has impressive density (so much so that it could pass as a Richebourg.) I was not the only person to notice how it became more more savory and ferrous in the glass, after 30 minutes suggesting a touch of Japanese tea (the proper, thickly textured type). Just wondrous. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
1752,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is not a million miles away from the Richebourg in style, again with hints of damp earth and woodland, quite ethereal as it often is at this stage, becoming more ""airy"" as it opens in the glass. The palate is structured on the entry, a little fuller and broader than the La Tâche, almost less discrete (though that sounds too pejorative). The acidity drives this forward and there is great substance on the finish. It will be intriguing to see whether this Romanée-Conti will retain this chutzpah once in bottle.",,RP 95
1753,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru has a more expressive, perhaps more floral bouquet compared to the Echézeaux at the moment. There is a mineral component here that is discretely stitched into these aromatics. The palate is medium-bodied, quite saline on the entry with a little more density than its 'little brother' -- he mouth tingling the sides long after it has departed. This appears to be a step up from the Echézeaux at this prenatal juncture, exuding the class of this great grand cru.",,RP 95
1754,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a precise bouquet, perhaps not quite as generous as I have found other, riper vintages at this stage, with a mixture of red and black fruit as well as a hint of violet and Earl Grey tea. The palate is medium-bodied with quite rigid tannin on the entry. This is a cool, more reserved Echézeaux than I was expecting, quite structured but with very fine precision on the finish.",,RP 95
1755,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2011 Corton Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti put in a similar showing as it did just after bottling earlier last year. It has less of the mushroom element than I recollect, adorned with pastille-like purity of red cherry and wild strawberry fruit, a slight ferrous note developing with time in the glass. The palate has developed a tad more roundness in the mouth in recent months, the tannins softened a little and it is consequently less masculine and more approachable. That said, as much as I enjoyed polishing off my glass, I would advise allowing this several years in bottle so that it can lose its puppy fat.",,RP 95
1756,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"This is the second time that I have tasted the 2010 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru from bottle from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and it was a wine that prompted a table of mature Pinot aficionadoes to remark upon the joys of infanticide. This is just a fantastic wine from the domaine. The nose is heavenly with its exquisite delineation, the fruit maybe a touch darker and earthier than a couple of years ago -- yet still with subtle woodland/sous-bois aromas and a hint of morels. The palate is wonderfully defined, so fresh and precise with filigree tannin. Yet there is great backbone to this wine, a framework that imparts a sense of symmetry that is totally disarming. Of course, readers should afford this magnificent wine a decade in the cellar...unless by complete accident a corkscrew falls into the cork and twists around until the cork pops out. Then you will have to drink it.",,RP 95
1757,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1991 Romanée Conti Grand Cru was tasted at the same private dinner in Beaune with the 1978 and the awry 1966. Whilst I was totally smitten by the 1978, this 1991 did not quite engage the senses as I thought it would, writing as a big fan of the 1991 vintage. The aromatics are mute at first and you get the sense that it is holding everything back despite being over 20 years old and my rigorous swirling of the glass. Red berries and subtle undergrowth scents emerge, bay leaf. The palate is structured and a little rigid at the moment, hints of white pepper emerging with time, dusky red berry fruit, quite structured and masculine. Strangely I had fonder memories of the La Tâche 1991, drunk twice earlier this year. I could not quite engage with this Romanée-Conti as I did with the 1978. Perhaps that was just its showing on the day? I hope I get the opportunity to find out. Tasted November 2015.",,RP 95
1758,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1978 Romanée Conti Grand Cru is a wine that I thought I would never taste. This bottle was served at a private dinner in Beaune with Bertrand de Villaine present. The bottom line is -- it delivered. With a thin tawny rim it shows its age, but the bouquet is truly transcendental, a mixture of red and black fruit such as wild strawberries and raspberry, and a hint of pomegranate all beautifully defined. With aeration it begins to offer more secondary aromas, such as brown sugar and a scent of a Tuscan delicatessen. The palate lives up to expectations with very fine tannins, fresh and tensile with a veneer of shimmering dark plum and raspberry fruit that soon gives way to more meaty notes, almost ferrous towards the finish. It has almost unbearable finesse. Is it a perfect wine? Almost. As much as I could, I drank this, as it is just a sublime and evocative Pinot Noir. Tasted November 2015.",,RP 95
1759,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1958 Romanée Conti Grand Cru was served blind at a dinner in London. As provenance is such an issue, this came from an impeccable source, namely the sale of Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni's cellar that was sold through Christies (see Michael Broadbent's ""Vintage Wine"" tome). What a pleasant surprise, especially given the vintage. Mature with a chestnut core, the bouquet has a ferrous tinge, and it is quite stately with a hint of undergrowth and chestnut that infuse that still bright red berry fruit. It is not potent in any shape ot form, but there is marvelous delineation and that runs through onto the palate. There are fine tannins here, a slightly citric edge that infuses the tart red fruit. It is not complex, but there is still a brightness and joie-de-vivre about this Romanée-Conti, with hints of bay leaf and minerals on the aftertaste. This is just wonderful. Tasted October 2015.",,RP 95
1760,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Oh yes. Oh yes, yes, yes. This 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is a bit like a great athlete, one who really shows its class against stiff opposition, here in the form of 18 other Richebourg! It follows the same thread as the imperial 1999 La Tâche. It has been blessed with a sensational nose that boasts quite astonishing delineation and precision, fabulous mineralité. The aromatics are far more detailed and enthralling than the 2007 tasted alongside. The palate is beautifully structured, virtually symmetrical with filigree tannin, with a gentle crescendo in the mouth towards an effervescent finish with hints of orange peel. Simply effortless. ",,RP 95
1761,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1995 Richebourg Grand Cru is a wine that I have not tasted for a few years, but it did not enthrall like the 1999 or have the easy-going charm of the 2007 Richebourg. There is some maturity showing on the brick-ish rim. The nose is forward and earthy with sage, dried orange peel and a touch of mint, though it feels a little more diffuse that I was expecting. The palate is balanced and quite savory, perhaps more than I was expecting. It is an enjoyable Richebourg, but it does not have the stamp of authority. I suspect there are better bottles than this, ergo my plus-sign next to a somewhat parsimonious score. ",,RP 95
1762,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2003 Grands Echézeaux from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti impressed its audience and duped everyone from thinking it heralded from the 2003 vintage. It has a potent ripe strawberry, mulberry and dried rose petal nose that actually had to throw off a little reduction upon first acquaintance. The palate is medium-bodied with layers of sappy red berry fruit. The initial tightness gradually dissipates to reveal quite a ""stocky"" Grands Echézeaux with good length, if not the detail of a top vintage from this vineyard.",,RP 95
1763,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. It was initially difficult to choose between the 1999 and 2002 La Tâche, but in the end the former just ascended to the stratosphere, while the latter simply cruised, albeit at a very high altitude. Now at 13 years of age, there is just a slight bricking on the rim. It feels a little more forward than the 1999–a stylish and personality-driven bouquet with predominantly red berry fruit interlaced with warm bricks and undergrowth (much more so of the latter compared to the 1999). The palate is beautifully balanced with exquisite tannin, perfect acidity and an effortless, you might say easygoing personality. That is deceptive because it is a complex and utterly harmonious La Tâche that is the epitome of elegance. Unlike the 1999, I would broach this now with an hour's decanting. Wonderful. ",,RP 95
1764,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Grands Echézeaux 2000 is a cerebral Burgundy, not quite as convincing as it was three years ago, but still a great wine. Here it has a vibrant red berry, stony bouquet that is reserved at first, but opens nicely with limestone and sea-spray scents emerging with time. It has a quite brilliant balance on the palate–not a powerful Grands Echézeaux but complex, with hints of black olive and chlorophyll emerging toward the finish that gently fans out and becomes a little spicier as it aerates. Superb.",,RP 95
1765,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Echézeaux 2000 from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti won the hearts of everyone around the table–one of those wines that you just cannot help falling for. It has a dark garnet core with thin bricking on the rim. The nose is actually reminiscent of a fine Musigny from de Vogüé, a little introverted at first but it's just kidding with you and bursts open with infectious joie de vivre. The palate is medium-bodied, quite linear at first with superb tension and energy. No, it is not as complex as the Grands Echézeaux 2000 but that Loire-like, sappy finish is beguiling. Drink now and enjoy over the next 15 years. Given the growing season this performs way above expectations.",,RP 95
1766,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aubert de Villaine mentioned that this was only the second time that this fabled wine had been tasted outside the domaine. The Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru 2000 has a lucid straw colour. The nose is irresistible with popcorn and almond, hints of hazelnut, almost Meursault-like in style and full of energy. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine seam of acidity, touches of nougat and marzipan lending it an almost Sonoma-like allure with a long, candied finish. Just delicious–no more, no less.",,RP 95
1767,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Having not tasted the La Tâche 1999 since it had been bottled, I was intrigued to see how it was developing. Monumentally, is the correct answer. First and foremost this is a seriously long-term La Tâche that is maturing at a glacial pace. Indeed, I left most in my glass and waited for it to open. An hour later and it was firing on all cylinders. It is blessed with an incredibly intense, powerful nose that loses its broodiness with aeration and eventually unveils a crystalline set of mineral-soaked aromatics that sport a decadent, almost exotic floral note–wilted violets and potpourri. The palate has a quite astonishing structure, but it is more the symmetry that makes this one of the greatest vintages of recent years. It unfolds with daring passion to reveal layers of plush but focused dark plum and cassis fruit that just seem to flow and flow on the never-ending finish. It is a multifaceted, multidimensional masterpiece that really needs another decade in bottle.",,RP 95
1768,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. I tasted the La Tâche 1991 twice within 24 hours: the first ex-domaine and the second purchased from auction in Switzerland, both with Aubert de Villaine present. The former was the best, right? Wrong. It was actually the second that clearly delivered, the ex-domaine example so brutally backward that it was more impressive than a wine to love. That was not the case with the second. The nose was unapologetically ethereal with mineral-laden black fruit with hints of cold wet limestone and peaty moorland on a gloomy winter's day. The precision is quite astonishing. The palate is perfectly balanced as it glides effortlessly across the mouth, intense rather than powerful, a gentle crescendo that fans out gracefully on the finish. I have always had faith in the 1991 La Tâche and now it is coming out of the shadow of the 1990 and proving once and for all, which wine is the greater. ",,RP 95
1769,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg 1991 is showing just the first signs of bricking on the rim. It is more savoury than I expected with subtle gamey notes infusing the dense black fruit and a touch of leather in the background. The palate is robust and powerful at first, clearly very well balanced and then easing back with aeration as it becomes ever more elegant and slightly ferrous. There are plenty of tart red fruit toward the finish and when leaving it in my glass I noticed that the ferrous tincture on the palate begins to evolve on the nose. This Richebourg is cruising, and should continue to give pleasure over the next decade or two. Sublime.",,RP 95
1770,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1990 sports a deep garnet core with brick rim. The palate is obviously from a relatively warm Burgundy vintage and delivers a surfeit of ripe, juicy and powerful red fruit infused with black truffle, leather and mint, with time a touch of rose petals. It gains more and more delineation with time, though never quite achieves the clinical precision of the 1991. The palate is full-bodied and for La Tâche, quite sinewy with layers of intense, rounded, svelte red berry fruit with just a touch of piquancy. It has an enormous structure and undeniable presence, yet this bottle could not hold a torch to either the 1991 or the 1999 La Tâche. Aubert de Villaine himself commented that he prefers the 1991 La Tâche to the 1990 and I concur. This is a great La Tâche but now with 25-years on the clock, one wonders whether it is past its peak?",,RP 95
1771,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Having only encountered the La Tâche 1985 once from magnum, I was intrigued to see how it shows from bottle. To be honest, this did not live up to the billing and as far as anyone could tell (including Aubert de Villaine) there was nothing wrong with it. First, it looks far more mature than the aforementioned magnum from 2011. There are plenty of dried herbs and surprisingly (for such a precocious vintage) plenty of leafy red berry fruit that just lack the presence of the 1991 or the precision of the 1980. The palate is medium-bodied with a smooth texture. It is nicely balanced, but I was not the only one to remark on a lack of depth here, almost a predictable finish that does not seem to go anywhere despite allowing it to open in my glass. As a Burgundy 1985 it is satisfactory, but if I were paying the market price then I might defer. I wonder whether bottles are on the slippery slope and magnums holding up strong?",,RP 95
1772,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The first thing to say is that this bottle of La Tâche 1974 was better than the 1972! It shows a little more clarity on the nose with pleasant scents of light cherries, leather, fennel and brown sugar. The palate is simple, rather monochromatic with jasmine tea on the tapered finish. This is just holding on by its fingernails. Drink up. ",,RP 95
1773,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. This bottle of La Tâche 1972 showed poorly, even when compared to other infamously difficult coeval vintages. Firstly it is cloudy–always a bad omen. The nose offers smudged brown sugar and cola scents with noticeable madeirization. The palate is actually better with creditable depth, but it seems to be very chaptalized and feels short and oxidized on the finish. This has little pleasure left.",,RP 95
1774,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. I wanted to like the La Tâche 1970 more than I could. Pale in color with a wide brick rim, the nose is rather muffled and mushroom-like with oxtail and wilted flowers. The palate is disappointing after what was a decent bouquet, a little hollow and disjointed although it possesses some depth on the rustic finish. It feels as if it is drying up. Opt for the vintages either side.",,RP 95
1775,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1969 provided a fitting end for what was a great run of vintage throughout the decade. Now at 45 years old it unashamedly sports a mature, brickish hue. The nose does not quite contain the untrameled exuberance of the 1964 or 1966, but there is a sense of elegance and refinement in situ. The palate is well balanced, slightly rustic in style with chewier tannins than other vintages. There is clearly good backbone here with spice, tangy marmalade and white pepper on the finish that is just missing a little precision. I suspect this was superior 10 to 15 years ago and is now in gentle decline. However, unlike others this is still worth seeking out. ",,RP 95
1776,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1966 is one of those wines were composing a tasting note seems futile. How can you express such a wine in words? Well, I will try. It must be considered one of the greatest La Tâche of all time. Typically of this vineyard it is a mercurial Pinot Noir that is deceptively simple upon first acquaintance. Then you notice its unbelievable delineation as scents of dark fruit, sous bois, cigar box and an exotic hint of star anise gently unfold. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins and nigh perfect acidity. There is such brightness and vigor in the 1966, allied with a sense of authority. Over time it gains precocity and there is a daring note of cough candy surfacing unexpectedly on the finish after ten minutes. This is an astonishing La Tâche that flirts with perfection.",,RP 95
1777,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"Firstly, it should be said that a mischievous Aubert de Villaine served the Romanée-Conti 1965 blind. A couple of people guessed correctly, though I suspect they were hedging their bets on an anniversary vintage rather than the quality of the wine. The long and short of it is, the 1965 is miles better than it has any right to be given that this was reputedly one of the worst growing seasons ever. It is clear in colour, faded with a tuile rim. The nose is quite complex–not intense, but defined, with a hint of camphor complementing those decayed autumn leaves. The aromatics decline, but only after 15 to 20 minutes. The palate is medium-bodied, very well balanced with surprising presence of a wine 50 years old. The tannins feel a little rustic and it tapers dramatically toward the finish, but for a short while this is actually very enjoyable. I'll probably never drink it again–but what an experience.",,RP 95
1778,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Given the performance of the Romanée-Conti 1965 the previous evening, surely everyone attending was privately speculating whether the La Tâche 1965 could defy form with such daring-do. The answer is ""non,"" but don't dismiss it entirely. Mature with a brick core and tawny-colored rim, it has a slightly tawdry, singed-leather nose that is diffuse and relinquished all its fruit years ago. But the palate is better with vestiges of freshness, notes of soy and brown sugar (chaptalization?) with a simple but pretty finish that is like watching a flame being snuffed out between your fingers. ",,RP 95
1779,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1964 is one of those heaven-sent wines that you instantly know you might never drink again. This bottle clearly attested to what was a vintage studded with great wines from the domaine. First, there is that almost refulgent color, beaming at you from the glass. It seems more youthful than many of the subpar wines from the 1970s. The nose is divine: tart red fruit, briary, rose petal and Earl Grey tea all brilliantly defined. The palate is fresh and energetic–a 50-year old wine that has retained incredible tension and animation, while the finish has a pastille-like purity and real sucrose intensity. This is a quite brilliant wine from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. ",,RP 95
1780,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. It is rare to find wines from this vintage nowadays. The La Tâche 1957 has a rather bleak and lifeless nose. I don't find anything wrong with this bottle except that I am probably drinking it three decades past its best. It is short and hard, the fruit having scarpered long ago. This is past its best.",,RP 95
1781,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"This note for the La Tâche 1953 comes from a private dinner held at La Trompette in September 2014 rather than the bottle at the La Tâche vertical that did not quite have the same freshness. The provenance for the first bottle was impeccable, coming from Ronald Avery's cellar in Bristol having never been moved. It has an extremely complex bouquet with vestiges of decayed red fruit mixed with black truffle, tobacco and even a touch of garrigue. The palate is beautifully balanced with a crisp line of acidity. There is a touch of Earl Grey tea that is a commonality with the Romanée-Conti '53 and it concludes with a mellow, harmonious finish that has an autumnal air. What a graceful La Tâche.",,RP 95
1782,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanée-Conti 1953 was the second vintage after the vineyard was replanted in 1945, so one must remember that the vines were just seven years old (assuming that the ground was not left fallow.) Mature in color with pale brick rim, it has a clean and well defined bouquet that if I am being truly honest, is missing the vigor that you might expect. It suggests that it might have been pretty in the past, but it is too ephemeral for my liking. I prefer the palate that is precise and balanced, elegiac with autumn leaves, tobacco and dried flowers. Over five minutes it gently builds in the mouth and meanwhile, the aromatics develop fireside hearth scents and gain intensity. I would drink any bottles in the near future and I suspect that vintages such as 1955 or 1959 will have more to offer in their dotage. That said, Aubert de Villaine intimated that he had encountered better bottles in the past, hence the plus sign accompanying my score.",,RP 95
1783,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1952 is one of the better wines of the decade, one of the pleasant surprises. Clearly deeper in color than the 1950, it has lovely definition on the nose with vestiges of decayed, leafy red berry fruit, dried herbs, rose petals and lavender. With aeration it loses with its femininity and becomes earthier with a whiff of the old Lapsong Souchang. The palate is nicely structured and masculine–the remnants of rustic tannins firm and rendering this almost Bordeaux-like in style. There is a touch of dryness on the finish, but otherwise this is a very pleasurable La Tâche that continues to give pleasure, albeit in a more austere style than the 1953. ",,RP 95
1784,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1950, not the greatest of Burgundy vintages, has a fully mature appearance–brick core with a tawny rim. All it needs is a pension book to go with it. The nose is actually not that bad: light and quite dusty and leathery with just a touch of molasses. The palate is distinctly leafy and herbaceous, not a million miles away from a Clos de Lambrays 1950 tasted just a few weeks earlier. It finishes in light-hearted, somewhat monotone fashion with hints of orange rind and Vervain tea and then hurries out the exit. ",,RP 95
1785,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Unlike the 1937, the La Tâche 1943 is a war veteran that is still offering some pleasure. It is pale in color–understandable considering its age. The nose comes together nicely–frail at first but with pleasant damp earthy notes and some freshness. The palate is medium-bodied and balanced with bitter cherry, a touch of sourness creeping in, but a brisk light citric note on the linear finish. Not a bad Pinot Noir for a 72-year old and just emitting its last vestiges of sensory pleasure. It deserves a salute.",,RP 95
1786,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. How I would have loved to have written an evangelical note on this, the oldest vintage of La Tâche that I have tasted. Alas, the 1937 was oxidized and this bottle out of condition.",,RP 95
1787,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"Usually, choosing between La Tâche and Romanée-Conti is like choosing between your two favourite children. Not this year. The 2012 Romanée-Conti is one of the most spellbinding that I have tasted since I began 17 years ago. The bouquet is quite astonishing with brilliant delineation and focus, an almost disorientating sense of mineralité that soars from the glass and leaves you speechless. The palate is perfectly proportioned with a sensational line of acidity, brimming over with energy and frisson. This flirts with perfection and you know, one day it might actually achieve it. Just 350 cases produced.",,RP 95
1788,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2012 La Tâche was picked September 25 and 27 at 21 hectoliters per hectare. It is blessed with one of those aromatic profiles that stops you in your tracks, in some ways stops time itself. There is an intensity and drive here, a mixture of red and black fruit, autumn leaves and wet limestone and later, roof tiles on a hot July afternoon. The palate is medium-bodied and nigh perfectly balanced. The tannins are filigree, the fruit extremely pure with an intense mineralité on the finish. There is an effortless quality about this La Tâche and yet is just clams up on the finish, does not quite deliver that knockout blow that so many other vintages have given. Perhaps it is saving it for later? Readers should note that there is just 1,113 cases produced rather than the usual 1,870.",,RP 95
1789,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg 2012 was picked September 27-28 at just 19 hectoliters per hectare, one of the lowest yields in this vintage. This has a serious bouquet, reserved at first, more earth than air. Unusual for this cuvee, there is a sense of exoticism here, a Richebourg daring to show a bit of ankle. Blackberry pastille intermingle with wilted violets, and there is a touch of warmth that belies the precocity of the growing season. Leaving it aside for 10 minutes, there are hints of Provençal herbs, broom and even fennel. The palate is medium-bodied and the first thing that strikes you is its backbone. Well, this is Richebourg after all. But there is an arching structure to this wine that is disguised by the silkiness of its texture, plus an almost citrus freshness and brightness on the finish. This is a Richebourg that will make you giddy with pleasure. 634 cases produced.",,RP 95
1790,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanée St Vivant, incidentally served before Richebourg rather than afterwards unlike previous years, was picked on September 28 and 29 at 24 hectoliters per hectare. There is a wondrous, ethereal purity to this 2012, a little more sumptuous than I recall it from barrel, with kirsch and freshly picked strawberries. As it opens, it gains more and more sensuality. The palate is rounded, almost curvaceous in the mouth, clearly more concentrated than the 2011 with a sense of authority and purpose, a bit of daring-do on the long finish. It leaves a slightly ferrous residue on the aftertaste, completing what is a marvelous and sensual Grand Cru. 1,148 cases produced.",,RP 95
1791,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2012 Grands Echézeaux  was picked on September 22, 24 and 25, at 27 hectoliters per hectare. Compared to the Echézeaux the nose is more demure, perhaps more refined, does not feel the urge to ""put it all out"" as it were. Reticent is the word - yet the precision and delineation is undeniable. The palate is medium-bodied with very supple tannin, here a mixture of red and black fruit, a little broodier and more introspective than its ""cousin"" but with greater persistence in the mouth. It unfurls on the finish: hints of dry tobacco and cedar, leaving you with the impression of a ""masculine"" Grands Echézeaux, one built for the long haul. 987 cases produced.",,RP 95
1792,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2012 Corton Grand Cru was cropped at 11 hectoliters per hectare on September 21. Clear, almost pale in color, the nose exudes that term often appropriated to Burgundy: transparency. The aromatics gradually unfold with light strawberry and red cherry scents, just a hint of sous bois in the background. The palate is crisp on the entry with tart cherries, a fine line of acidity and hints of brown sugar interwoven through the finish that fans out gently. It feels a little foursquare, a ""correct"" Corton that is perhaps letting the fellow Grand Crus take the limelight. But it will give pleasure over the next 10 to 12 years, and though it might not represent the best Corton since the domaine took over the parcels in 2009, it is perhaps the one that slots in perfectly with the other wines. Just 242 cases produced this year.",,RP 95
1793,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I adored the 2012 Echézeaux Grand Cru from barrel and I adore it from bottle. Picked on September 29-30  at 22 hectoliters per hectare, those explosive aromatics from barrel are replicated here with bright red cherries, kirsch and rose petals, all beautifully defined and imbued with a sense of exuberance. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe tannin, a dash of white pepper on the tip of the tongue and a beautifully poised, elegant finish. This is an Echézeaux determined to be above its station. Wonderful. 1,057 cases produced.",,RP 95
1794,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc,"Bought from a list off a small bistro in the backwaters of Burgundy, the 2007 Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc, from no less than Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, is one of those fabled wines that few have tasted. My own experience extends to just a couple of encounters of the 2004 a few years ago. I have ask Aubert exactly where it is made, but all I know is that it comes from vines from around the Abbé St Vincent and it says that it was bottled at the domaine, proceeds going to restoration of the abbey. It had an endearing honeycomb and buttered toast bouquet, simple but well defined, indicative of a wine that is probably fully mature. There was just a touch of oxidation on the palate, but otherwise it was surprisingly rich, slightly viscous in texture with walnut, smoke and dried honey on the finish that bore faint semblance to a vin de paille! Readers should note before they go scavenging the bistros, this was perhaps the last bottle from their stock.",,RP 95
1795,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I was quietly blown away by the sheer quality of this bottle of 1979 Echézeaux from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. It has an indescribably elegant and refined bouquet that has the depth one would have expected from de Villaine's Richebourg, for example. There are copious dark berry fruit mixed with black truffles and girolle, undergrowth scents developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin. There is plenty of depth and dimension to this grand cru, with real precision on the finish. A quite magical example of the supposed ""lowliest"" grand cru from the domaine in a lowly vintage. I'll take this any day!",,RP 95
1796,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"As usual, the 2013 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is more reticent on the nose compared to La Tâche at this point. As if fooling with you, it begins to unfurl with crystalline purity: Morello cherries and wild strawberry, wet limestone and wilted rose petals developing over time. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, stunning balance and a feminine, winsome finish that goes on for a over a minute. Perhaps this is more nuanced than the La Tâche, but does not quite have the same dimension and depth. We’ll see.",,RP 95
1797,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru is probably more expressive than the Echézeaux on the nose with heightened delineation. Here there is wonderful precision and penetration. A second barrel showed a more floral character, the fruit slightly redder than the first. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins. This is just full of energy percolating through the dark berry, bergamot and bilberry fruit, yet there is a firm grip on the masculine finish, the second barrel a touch suppler and pastille-like. This is an aristocractic Grands Echézeaux in the making.",,RP 95
1798,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a pure bouquet with minerally blackberry and raspberry scents, plus a light marine influence. The palate is surprisingly concentrated considering the growing season, thanks to it being the last vineyard picked on October 12 and the super-low yields of 16 hectoliters per hectare. It is endowed with impressive weight matched with a fine thread of acidity. There is a gentle grip in the mouth, but with the volume you might expect in a Richebourg on the finish. This is very promising - a quite ambitious Echézeaux in the making.",,RP 95
1799,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"What few ‘66s from DRC I have tasted have all been utterly sublime and this 1966 Romanée St Vivant is no exception. Served blind, from first sniff it was clear that we were in the company of a very serious, mature Pinot Noir. The bouquet is utterly divine with incredibly detailed scents of tart red cherry, soy, orange peel and minerals, the true essence of that abstract “pinoté."" The palate is perfectly balanced, the silver thread of acidity lending it tension and poise. Yet there is also an abiding sense of effortlessness, as if this wine has to do little to entrance, with just a lovely hint of salinity on the aftertaste. One of the finest wines I will taste this year. Stellar!",,RP 95
1800,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Montrachet was picked on 6 September at a respectable 37.1hl/ha. Lucid in colour, perhaps a little deeper than expected, it has a multi-faceted nose that you have to monitor over one hour. Hints of almond and butterscotch emerge at first, then salted caramel, pralines and peach skin. It is mercurial and utterly alluring. The palate is intense on the entry and immediately expresses a sense of vitality and tension. This Montrachet is suffused with great weight in the mouth with subtle touches of orange peel, almond and hazelnut that ebb with time. It mellows in the glass but never dispensing with one iota of tension, yet seeming if anything to gain in volume. This epitomizes great Montrachet. 265 cases produced. Drink 2016-2030+. ",,RP 95

As usual, the Romanee-Conti is reticent at first, as if the wine is checking you out before deciding whether you are worthy. It then unfurls to reveal a precise, exquisitely focused bouquet with crushed strawberry, flint and smoke. The palate is devastatingly smooth on the entry. The tannins are lace-like, the acidity perfectly judged and it gently crescendos in the mouth towards a seductive poised finish that lingers incredibly long. This is a master-class in ‘less being more’: a consummate Romanee-Conti for mid- rather than long-term cellaring. 473 cases produced. Drink 2017-2035+",,RP 96

The palate is medium-bodied with immense purity and delicacy on the entry. This La Tache is extremely focused, velvety smooth in the mouth and although not as complex as the 2010, it has a beguiling femininity that will seduce at ten paces. It is extremely long in the mouth but politely does not outstay its welcome. Divine. 1,514 cases produced. Drink 2017-2040. ",,RP 96
1803,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2011 Richebourg was picked on 7 and 8 September at 28.36hl/ha. It has a very pure bouquet, a mixture of blackberry, raspberry leaf, freshly tilled meadow and a touch of cold stone. It is not a powerful bouquet, but delineated and very focused. The palate is not dissimilar to the Grands Echezeaux on the entry: linear and poised with crisp brambly red fruit. But it swerves another way mid-through, developing a wonderful candied core of strawberry and Morello and a caressing finish sending ripples of pleasure across the senses. In many ways it is a self-effacing Richebourg with charm and candour, but I Richebourg that I suspect may be deceptively long lived.

Now this has a very interesting bouquet, quite distinct from the Richebourg and the Grands Echezeaux. It is much more exuberant and lifted, very perfumed with fresh strawberry, red cherries, dried rose petals and a touch of quince. This is so lively and vivacious, as if it borrowed some of the succulence from the 2009 vintage. The palate is quite precocious on the entry, the mouth instantaneously tingling with glee. There is a beautiful crescendo before fanning out towards its silky caressing finish. There is something playful and joyous about this Romanee-Saint-Vivant, carefree and alluring, a wine to be enjoyed as much as respected. 1,164 cases produced. Drink 2016-2035.",,RP 96
1805,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Grands Echezeaux 2011 was picked on 9 and 10 September at 25.33hl/ha. There is certainly more intensity and fruitiness on the nose compared to the Echezeaux. The aromatics here feel fuller, rounder and more harmonious that its sibling. As the wine remains in the glass there are subtle cassis notes that begin to emerge accompanied by over-ripe oranges. The palate is well balanced and fresh on the entry, with slightly powdery tannins. It is very harmonious with well-judged acidity and compared to the Echezeaux there is more weight and corpulence to counterbalance the strict structure. It gently builds, never losing its head mind you, towards a lightly spiced finish that fans out beautifully. This is a very accomplished rather than spectacular Grands Echezeaux. 923 cases produced.

It opens nicely with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly brusque entry. The tannins are quite pointed here, creating a more angular Echezeaux compared to the 2011, whilst it needs to develop just a little more flesh and weight towards the back end that feels a little brittle and attenuated at the moment. Still, there is a fine saline, almost nori seaweed tang on the aftertaste – a nice twist in the tail. 1,030 cases produced. Drink now-2027",,RP 96
1807,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"My first encounter with the 1991 Grand Echezeaux was a very positive one. It has a heaven-sent bouquet with quite brilliant delineation that really shows off the quality of the terroir – just pure unfettered Pinote. The palate is medium-bodied, supple at first but with admirable concentration: ebullient and vivacious red cherries intermingling with raspberry and a slight ferrous note. Good structure, as usual, with a well-knit and very focused finish that lingers gloriously in the mouth. Bon vin! Tasted November 2013.

It has an open, expressive, delineated bouquet with dried rose petals and bergamot, hints of orange rind in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with bewitching balance and focus, perfectly pitched acidity and an elegant, feminine and graceful finish that leaves the mouth tingling. Weightless and yet intense, you yearn for another sip. This constitutes one of the finest mature DRC wines that I have tasted. Tasted November 2013.

1809,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Tasted at The Sampler as part of their icon series of wines, the 1955 Richebourg Grand Cru is a pleasant surprise. The color is commensurate with its age, with broad bricking at the rim, its pallid hue belying a surprisingly vivacious bouquet with wild hedgerow, dried orange rind and rusty nails. Leaving it to open for a couple of minutes there is an unexpected minty scent. The palate is light, but balanced, with a smooth, harmonious entry. Still fresh and yet elegiac, the frayed finish is tender and a little hard, having lost its Richebourg robustness many moons ago. But there is something beguiling about this wine and I suspect a perfect bottle would be quite astonishing. Drink now. Tasted November 2013.

1810,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1941 Richebourg Grand Cru is one of the most astonishing wartime bottles that I have ever encountered. Deep in color, it has a respectable bouquet given its age with well-defined, tertiary red-berry fruit that is not complex or profound, but fresh and delightful. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity, crisp tannins, vestiges of wild strawberry and raspberry that lead to a composed, understated finish that leaves you with a smile plastered on your face. No, it is not the greatest Richebourg I have ever tasted from the domaine, but there is something magical about this war veteran. Tasted November 2013.

1811,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1999 Romanee-St-Vivant initially has its nose put out of joint by the precocious 1999 Echezeaux, but allowing the wine to unfold over 30 to 40 minutes, it shows its true breeding. Returning after ten minutes, the nose positively explodes from the glass with a sorbet-like purity – hints of wild strawberry, cassis and a little blueberry – a piercing intensity that is wondrous to behold. The palate is medium-bodied and does not have the volume of the 1999 Echezeaux, but there is superior clarity and focus, the tannins clearly fine and the finish shimmering with tension and femininity. This is just a beautiful wine that will only get better. Drink 2016-2030.",,RP 96
1812,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I was intrigued to see how the 1999 Echezeaux would be performing at 14 years of age since I have not tasted it since just after bottling. It has a very classy nose of dark cherry fruit, quite exotic for one of Aubert de Villaine’s wines, with hints of blood orange and even peach skin infusing the opulent aromatic profile. The palate is well-balanced and tightly knit, though it is clear that the RSV 1999 alongside was born with a higher level of delineation and clarity. Still, you have to admire the brio and hubris of this Echezeaux, and its youthful zeal suggests it will age over three decades without too much sweat. Delicious. Drink 2015-2030.",,RP 96
1813,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"It has been several years since I last tasted this vintage of Aubert de Villaine’s Richebourg. This bottle has a pretty, generous bouquet with small dark cherries, iodine and raspberry preserve, the mineral component only becoming apparent with time in the glass. The palate is structured, more masculine than the nose suggests, supple and pure with a cohesive, rather sinewy finish. This is not a flamboyant Richebourg: more strict and unyielding, so I would give it another three or four years in the cellar. Tasted May 2013.",,RP 96
1814,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"Following a Chambertin ’72 from Rousseau is not easy, but I was not the only person amazed by the precocity of the Grands Echezeaux ’79. The vivacious nose is entrancing with tart red cherries, red currant and violets that seem half their age. It offers brilliant delineation considering its age, a bouquet with unbridled vivacity and joie de vivre. The palate is supremely well-balanced with an almost fructose-like entry – a feminine, pretty, pure Grands Echezeaux that puts profundity to one side and just wants to keep giving out pleasure. There is a sense of symmetry towards the crystalline finish that is a wonder to behold. This is a real surprise and moreover, you could imagine this bottle lasting another 20 years with ease. Tasted May 2013.",,RP 96
1815,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2009 Romanee-Conti is surprisingly huge and even obvious in this vintage. That isn’t a problem, just an observation. Romanee-Conti can be an elusive, intensely cerebral wine, but not in 2009. Floral notes add lift on the vivid, kaleidoscopic finish. Today the Romanee-Conti is all about breathtaking exuberance and richness. This is a breathtaking bottle. Anticipated maturity: 2029-2059.  

Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s 2009s have turned out just as brilliantly as I had hoped. The wines reflect the signature qualities of the year, but never lose their essential classicism. Long-time DRC fans know the domaine bottles in six-barrel lots, which naturally introduces a level of bottle variation that is not found in most other wines. I hope the massive amount of information that has recently come to light regarding counterfeit wines and their proliferation might be the catalyst for the domaine to consider bottling their wines in one homogenous lot, as is common for the vast majority of high-quality wines throughout the world. Once the domaine’s wines mature in 20-30 years it will be impossible to tell the difference between ‘normal’ bottle variation, poorly stored bottles and very good fakes. Certainly consumers who are willing and able to pay the prices these wines fetch are at the very least deserving of a consistent product.

It is as if all of the preceding wines are subsets of the Romanee-Conti, but in the Romanee-Conti we find all of the qualities that make the other wines so distinctive in one marvelously complete Burgundy. Aromatics reminiscent of Romanee St. Vivant make an appearance, followed by the sweetness that can only be La Tache, then the structure of Richebourg, all wrapped into the total elusiveness of Romanee-Conti. I am reminded of my university studies in music. There are some compositions that are so profoundly moving because they only point out the futility in trying to truly understand them.

1832,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2008 Romanee St. Vivant is pure seduction. The aromatics alone are breathtaking, but the RSV is truly firing on all cylinders. Curiously, today the RSV is quite a bit rounder and suppler than the Echezeaux and Grands-Echezeaux. It shows remarkable silkiness, inner perfume and nobility. A seamless finish rounds things out in style. My instincts tell me this will firm up in bottle, but frankly I am a bit mystified that hasn’t happened yet. Today, this doesn’t look like a super long-term ager within the context of the domaine’s very finest wines. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028.  

tasted the 2008s in bottle in late June 2011 after having gone through the 2010s from barrel. Aubert de Villaine describes 2008 as a difficult vintage with a lot of rain. Botrytis was an issue and the vineyards required constant attention. On September 14 the weather changed dramatically. A steady north wind dried out the grapes and concentrated sugars quickly, which also reduced the size of the berries. A further selection of fruit lowered yields to an even greater extent, resulting in overall production that is as much as 50% lower than normal for the Domaine. As for the wines, they are magnificent in my view, but will require considerable patience.

1833,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2008 Echezeaux is a noticeable step up in quality from the Vosne-Romanee. This is a decidedly rich, powerful Echezeaux endowed with considerable muscle. The aromas and flavors build beautifully towards a dazzling, harmonious finish. The 2008 is a big Echezeaux that could use further time in the cellar. There is plenty of underlying structure to support a long life in the cellar. The 2008 is seriously impressive. If any wine can be said to represent ‘value’ among the Domaine’s 2008s, the Echezeaux is it. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2038.

1834,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet,"The 2008 Vosne-Romanee Cuvee Duvalt-Blochet bursts from the glass with an explosion of aromas and flavors. The wine turns more subtle on the palate. Sweet, floral notes wrap around the sublime finish. The 2008 is a haunting wine graced with exquisite class and elegance. Unlike the rest of the domaine’s 2008s, it will drink beautifully pretty much right out of the gate. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2028.

1835,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2008 Montrachet is simply off the charts. Where to start? Layers of fruit literally explode in the glass as the wine conquers all of the senses. The aromatics alone are breathtaking, while the fruit shows striking nuance and transparency. But those descriptors totally fail to capture what is in the glass. This is one of the most moving young wines I have ever tasted. The 2008 is rich, seductive and powerful, but never heavy. Finely chiseled mineral nuances saturate the palate all the way through to the intensely saline finish. When I think of what I want Montrachet to be, it is this. The 2008 Montrachet is an aspirational wine in the very best sense. Ideally another few years in bottle will help the wine become even more expressive and several decades of profound drinking seem likely. Wow! Anticipated maturity: 2018+.

1836,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanee Cuvee Duvault-Blochet is a supple, racy wine. Layers of dark fruit blossom on the palate as this gorgeous, textured wine opens up in the glass. Sweet, silky tannins frame the exquisite finish. The Cuvee Duvault-Blochet is made from a second selection of fruit across all of the Domaine's vineyards in Vosne. In its finest vintages it is a terrific wine that delivers plenty of the winery's signature style at a slightly more accessible price. A recent bottle of the 2006 was striking. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.  

The historic Domaine de la Romanee-Conti has recently moved offices to a renovated complex in the center of Vosne. Aubert de Villaine compares the 2009s to the 1959s. I will have to take his word for it, as I wasn't even close to being born when those wines were made. De Villaine thinks the 2009s will remain open throughout their lives. Unfortunately I wasn't able to taste the Grands-Echezeaux, Richebourg and Romanee-St. Vivant, as the wines were bottled in the days leading up to my visit. I will report on those wines from bottle later this year. The harvest started on September 10 with Corton and ended on September 19 with the last of the Echezeaux. The 2009s were vinified with 100% whole clusters and aged in 100% new oak barrels.

1837,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2007 La Tache amply illustrates why this monopole is the darling among most of those lucky enough to regularly taste or collect the wines of the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. Hints of mocha, vanilla, maraschino, and almond paste lend a confectionary note to generously rich cassis and raspberry, while Latakia tobacco, peat, clove, black pepper, star anise, and cumin contribute commune-typical Vosne-Romanee personality in spades. The high-toned, sweet themes continue inner mouth, with intimation of heliotrope, rowan, and lily perfume, while the wine’s smoky, spicy elements seem to descend into a low-register undertone of roasted red meats and forest floor. As this opens to the air, a subtly sweet-saline suggestion of lobster shell reduction adds richness and succulence. Strikingly creamy in feel, this La Tache nevertheless possessed a fresh berry edge that helps convey vibrancy to a finish that practically glows in your mouth, offering another of those Burgundian paradoxes of light and dark. Here, de Villaine’s case for long-term potential is easily made, and I expect this will richly reward at least 15-20 years of attention.  

Domaine de La Romanee-Conti director Aubert de Villaine perceives both the estate’s 2008 and 2007 collections as vins de garde, and I can’t argue with that assessment, even though when I first tasted the 2007s – soon after they had come out of malo – I harbored reservations, wondering whether to interpret de Villaine’s description of them as “ethereal” to read “ephemeral.” He says holding back the usual 5% share of production for the Domaine’s own cellar was difficult in the greatly reduced 2008 vintage, and that he is already regretting not having arranged to bottle a larger share in magnum. He still had time when I visited in April to reconsider the bottle format for three appellations, which were the only ones I was able to taste, since De Villaine is loathe to show wines in the first 9-12 months after bottling. (I’ll report on the full 2008 collection from bottle at a later date.) If the 2007s here were unusual for that vintage in the degree to which they gained stature in the course of elevage, such behavior was normal when it came to 2008, so that I was not surprised to hear de Villaine remark on a new-found degree of confidence in the stature of that collection. To an even greater degree than in most vintages, success in 2007 and 2008 came down to meticulousness at every stage; to quality of vine material; and to location, in all of which respects no estate in Burgundy has any advantage over the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. Interestingly, the estate lingered no longer over the picking of their 2008s – from the first of the La Tache on September 27 to the last of the Echezeaux on October 6 – than they had over the 2007s, which were picked from September 1-11. The inclusion of stems was lowered to less than half in 2007, incidentally, but in 2008 was typically closer to three-quarters. Vendange entier is a technique not only time-honored and in continuous use at the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti (even when it fell out of favor at most Burgundy estates in the waning 20th century), but one which de Villaine and cellarmaster Bernard Noblet have subjected to repeated testing, so as to establish in any given vintage the right balance between 100% de-stemmed (“which lacks something by way of complexity,” says de Villaine) and 100% (“which can be too marked by the stems,” he continues).

1838,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"I have never been treated to such a profusion of floral perfume from this legendary site as rose over the glass of 2007 Romanee-Conti. Hyacinth, rose, gladiola, and iris are underlain by scents of moss-covered, damp stone, wild ginger, and diverse tiny red fruits. “Romanee-Conti c’est le nez,” remarks de Villaine of this almost ethereal Pinot. The contrast with the more fleshly La Tache could not be more dramatic. But this doesn’t pull back on its silken-textured palate, either – far from it: along with persistent inner-mouth profusion of floral perfume come savory, irresistibly juicy raspberry and pomegranate as well as an impression of marrow-rich, multi-boned meat stock. A wafting, wave-like finish harbors the sort of exhilarating sheer refreshment one looks for in white wine, and a kaleidoscopic interchange of colorful floral, spice, fruit, carnal, and mineral elements such as few wines of any sort can deliver.

1839,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Domaine’s 2007 Romanee-St.-Vivant predictably inhabits a different world – not to mention being in a different league of complexity and intrigue – from their Echezeaux, Grands Echezeaux, or Richebourg of that vintage. Peat, leather, humus, forest floor, and decadent floral perfume are joined by an oceanic saline, alkaline, kelp-tinged aspect, and these surf-and-turf aspects follow on a polished palate that – despite only the slightest nod in the direction of overt fruitiness by way of dark berries – nevertheless displays a mouth-watering juiciness to accompany its myriad mineral and organic complexities. A persistently satisfying and thought-provoking finish points to the likelihood of 12-15 years continuance.

1841,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Domaine’s 2007 Echezeaux displays ripe red berry and star anise aromas; a tender fruit character, mingled with a hint of mocha and underlain by subtly saline meat stock on a silken palate, and a finish that preserves just enough of a fresh edge to its fruit to stimulate salivation and the desire for the next sip. Here is a 2007 that remains true to the personality it expressed early on in barrel, albeit with flattering textural refinement and a greater sense of purity. It’s small scale, but only in the non-derogatory sense of chamber music (two words I used to describe it and, amusingly, later heard from de Villaine). I imagine this charmer being best enjoyed over the next 5-7 years.

1842,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"An extraordinary as well as extraordinarily intense aromatic display greets you from the glass of 2006 Romanee-Conti. Rose petals, griotte cherries, almond extract, mint, and cinnamon once again put me in mind of archetypal pinot with a soupcon of Gewurztraminer. The remarkable perfume and spice continue inner-mouth, allied to a silken textural refinement (as if the tannins were self-dissolving); to pure, fresh, but not at all superficially sweet cherry and raspberry essence; and to deep, marrowy meatiness and hints of truffle and forest floor. This pivots at midpoint, as it were – though far more subtly than does its Richebourg sibling – from perfume and fruit to almost sinister animal and mineral suggestions. The finish here is at once positively ethereal and deeply, darkly mysterious, like lingering harmony at the extremes of audibility. I suspect it will also outlive the other wines from this estate and vintage.

1843,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Domaine de La Romanee-Conti's 2006 Romanee-St.-Vivant charts its own mysterious path, dissimilar to that of their Grands-Echezeaux, as well as reflecting the strides in quality that have manifestly been achieved in recent years in this site, more than at any other at this domaine. Iris, buddleia, and musky narcissus-like floral perfume; ripe purple plum and blackberry; sassafras and licorice; along with smoked meat and a hoisin-like amalgam of spices and soy all waft alluringly from the glass. The tannins here are ultra-refined and there is a vintage-typical sense of levity, despite all of the dark intrigue of enveloping black fruits, forest floor, fungal, and carnal flavors that persist on the palate. Here is an uncanny alliance of the sensual and thought-provoking such as only great red Burgundy among the world's red wines can engender, and if this wine doesn't stimulate in you cravings and wonder at once, the fault is doubtless in yourself and not the glass. It seems to marry the brightness and finesse of the 2002 with the texturally richness of the (unexpectedly fine) 2000, two standouts in recent tasting of Romanee-St.-Vivant that I was privileged to attend. But there is much more depth here, and I expect that this wine's beauty will be worth pondering and savoring for at least two decades.

1844,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Domaine de La Romanee-Conti's 2006 La Tache possesses a sense of sheer density and a viscosity – by no means precluding energy – that go beyond the other wines in the Domaine's current collection. Scents of bitter-sweet floral perfume, citrus oils, white pepper, peat, and black fruit distillates pungently, almost aggressively fill the nose. The marrow and beef gelatin aspect of this Pinot is salient, but is allied on a palpably tannic palate with similarly impressive concentrated cooked black fruits, dark mushroom stock, forest floor, smoky Lapsang tea, and licorice. For grip and power, too, this surpasses its stable mates. But a glance back at the Romanee-St.-Vivant suggests that you can't have it all, and that this La Tache cannot approach that wine's finesse or quite equal its mystery. Still, I suspect this will be worth following for at least two decades.

What starts out suggestive of sweetness and light, turns dark and brooding. If you don't find that too depressing a metaphor to contemplate, and if you have patience (and, naturally, the requisite budget), this should be seriously worth revisiting from around 8-15 or more years of age.

In the mouth, this is relatively spare but formidably-concentrated and finely-tannic, with cedar, tartly-edged though ripe black fruits, and alkaline mineral notes that carry into a striking, bloodily carnal and almost briny finish. Here is Pinot Noir in its role as a mirror for human flesh and bone. What I see sends shivers down my spine and excites my imagination, but the wine seems to have no intention of flattering me. I didn't encounter another Pinot at all like this in the vintage, and it should be fascinating to follow for a dozen or more years, but unlike the Echezeaux, I would not plan to open any bottles for at least another 3-4.

1847,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet,"The Domaine's 2006 Vosne-Romanee Duvault-Blochet represents an assemblage from younger vines in Echezeaux, Grands-Echezeaux, Romanee-St.-Vivant, and Richebourg whose fruit did not make the cut for the estates grands vins. (Such a second wine has been essayed on several other occasions during the past decade. Previous bottlings of this cuvee were labeled ""Vosne 1er Cru"" which has led to occasional confusion. While the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti notoriously owns choice parcels of several Vosne premier crus, they have never – at least under the current management – bottled any wine from those sites, but rather only from their grand cru holdings.) Dark cherry, black raspberry, licorice, and charred meat in the nose lead to an initially lush, silken-textured palate, generously-fruited and tinged with clove and mace. The abundance of fine-grained tannin here becomes evident in the finish, accentuated by a hint of detached oak, but lightly-cooked fruit, charred meat, and spice continue to generously dominate. I would expect this to be best enjoyed over the next 4-5 years.   

The Domaine de La Romanee-Conti harvested from the 20th-25th of September (commencing with Richebourg) and subjected the crop to rigorous sorting. Understandably, the viticultural meticulousness at this estate as well as its team of some 60 highly-skilled and –motivated pickers paid dividends in the context of a challenging vintage. Director Aubert de Villaine and cellarmaster Bernard Noblet vinified their 2006s with a lesser share of stems and whole clusters, and exposed them to new wood for a shorter period (thereafter racking into older barrels) than the corresponding 2005s.

1848,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aubert de Villaine and his team harvested their 2006 Montrachet on September 26, and it was bottled (as a single assemblage) at the end of 2007. High-toned peach, lemon oil, musk, and floral aromas mark the penetrating, ethereal nose. Smoky, peach kernel pungency weaves its way through nutty, peachy richness on the palate. Less obviously dense, rich and sappy than the extraordinary 2005, this 2006 for all of its sheer viscosity and ripeness, displays a dynamic, almost shimmering sense of fruit and mineral interplay. Intriguingly, in my initial – November, 2007 tasting – this effect was more pronounced from a barrel that had been rolled to disburse the lees than in one that had undergone conventional batonnage. The youthful 2006 reflects its new wood environment in a way that the 2005 – at similar stages in its evolution – did not. There is no lack here of the mystery that should be expected from one of the world’s most fabled and expensive wines, not just in the paradox of viscosity, richness and power combined with elegance, lift, and refinement; but also in nuances that left me groping the lexicon for animal or mineral descriptors.

1849,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"There are more startling complexities in the 2005 Romanee-Conti than in any other wine here today, perhaps in the vintage. A stunning, high-toned and utterly unique perfume of pink grapefruit, blood orange, tangerine rind, vivid rose petal, musk, cinnamon, sage, and cassis seduces the olfactors in kaleidoscopic rotation. I hesitate to court sacrilege or ridicule with Germanic allusions but it is impossible not to imagine a great Pinot scented with Gewurztraminer and Scheurebe. On the palate, a pure, clean meatiness emerges, like butchering a meadow-fed lamb, bitter-sweet flowers flying forth in an inner-mouth profusion. Soy and black truffle lend a dark, savory note to the proceedings, leading the long finishing procession over a path strewn with rose petals. Fear not: despite its silken texture, there are abundant tannins woven into this amazing tapestry as well, and I am sure those lucky enough to own some can retain it as collateral, then leave it to their children, safe in the knowledge it has not decayed. Reverential drinking after a dozen or more years would, however, be my preference.

Once the grapes in these fabled vineyards had reached a potential alcohol of 13%, reports Aubert de Villaine, he was ready to pick, because conditions had seldom been so conducive to perfect ripeness (including that of the stems). It was all done in a week, commencing with La Tache and Romanee Conti, and finishing on September 23 with Romanee-St.-Vivant (and Montrachet, on which I shall report at a future date). De Villaine intended to bottle in March or April by gravity in six-barrel lots, as has become general practice here over the past decade.

1850,Domaine de la Vougeraie,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2005 La Tache epitomizes the unique mysteries of Pinot (not to mention the character of a great site), with its aromas of game, musk, iris, star anise, vanilla, allspice, and naturally also an abundance of sweet, ripe, implosively tiny-berried fruit. Imagine a black Riesling. On the palate, a vivid freshness of fruit, pungency of spice and flowers, and melting away of what in point of analytical fact are abundant tannins, all engender an almost white wine dynamic of fruit-mineral call-and-response and clear, incisive penetration of flavors to every recess of the mouth. This is a T.R. sort of wine – you just don’t feel the stick.

1851,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"Just as this year’s Echezeaux challenges the quality of the Grands-Echezeaux, another surprise of the vintage is a spectacular showing for the 2005 Romanee-St.-Vivant. A startlingly dark, mouth-watering amalgam of purple plum paste, blackberry preserves, bitter chocolate, toasted walnut, soy, and raw beef intrigues the nose. On the palate, this cleaves to the dark side, with viscous, mouth-coating concentration of lightly-cooked black fruits, charred meat, mysterious forest floor complexity, and bitter-sweet florality, but simultaneously delivers a vibratory finish like that of the energetic Grands-Echezeaux. With its palpable extract, profound personality, and refined but abundant tannins, this is surely wine to set aside for at least a decade.

1852,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2005 Grands-Echezeaux displays an utterly different, less charming personality than its “little” sibling. Fresh black raspberry and black cherry hover between sorbet-like and faintly-caramelized manifestations. The palate is obviously dense, with considerable grip and ultra-fine tannins, incipient silkiness, but not the creaminess of the Echezeaux. Fresh berry, faintly tart fruit skin, and nut oils inform an uncannily kinetic finish that makes one’s mouth quiver.

1853,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2005 Richebourg suggests lightly cooked cherry, lilies, and vanilla-chocolate pot de creme, coming onto the palate with a gentle wave of creamy fruit, almost shockingly open-knit and youthfully generous. Low-toned richness of salted beef broth and a hint of wet stone add hints of gravitas, but despite ample (refined) tannins, there is nothing to restrain a veritable gushing of ripe, juicy, sweet finishing fruit. This might close up for a time, but these early indications suggest one ought to revisit it in 3-5 years and expect it to offer much earlier enjoyment than the Grands-Echezeaux or Romanee-St.-Vivant.

1854,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2005 Echezeaux delivers ravishingly sweet, high-toned aromas of black raspberry, maraschino, marzipan, marmalade and iodine. It saturates the palate with sweet, ripe fruit and inner-mouth perfume, while introducing layers of fresh meat and shrimp-shell minerality. The texture is amazingly creamy and polished, and the long, refined finish adds an alluring hint of mocha. Superb saturation of ultra-ripe fruit but with freshness; remarkable concentration yet elegance, lift, indeed near weightlessness: this is 2005 at its best. The temptation to drink this in its early years will, I suspect, be irresistible ... let’s hope so anyway. It would be a shame for this beauty to be locked away as a collectible, even if it is capable of long-aging.

Rot is simply a sorting problem, and for that we are very well equipped. The sugar levels were very nice, but the grapes did not have the phenolic ripeness of 1999 or 2001. Ultimately, 2000 is the absolute opposite of 1999 at the Domaine since the wines are feminine and delicate. They are wines for connoisseurs, like a cross between 1992 and 1995. In fact, I’d say they are like 1992 but with more volume and fruit.” None of the Domaine’s 2000s are recommended as they were found to be lean, rustic, hard, and backward. In addition, two of the wines had vegetal characteristics and another two may have been tainted with rot.

1878,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru,"In 1999, the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti did something that it has never done before, producing a Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru. This wine was made from a second harvest that took place a few days after the initial harvest in La Tache. The wine is medium to dark ruby-colored and has a rose, violet, and red cherry-scented nose. Medium-bodied, lush, and expansive, it is fresh, filled with crunchy red and black berries, and has an impressively long, sweet, tannin-filled finish. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2010. Bravo!

1879,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Notes of Botrytis Cinerea (also known as noble rot) are evident in the hedonistically appealing, bright gold-colored 1998 Montrachet's nose. Its honeyed spice and vanilla aromas are followed by a decadently sexy personality. This round, hyper-rich wine is crammed with overripe fruits, touches of caramel, and French toast soaked in syrup. It is magnificently flavorful and pleasing yet does not have the capacity to gain in complexity with cellaring. Drink this spicy fruit bomb over the next 5-6 years.

1880,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Having retasted DRC's 1997 Montrachet in March, 2000, it was apparent that my earlier assessment was both conservative in judgement and anticipated maturity dates. It reveals a straw/goldish color and loads of tropical fruit, mineral, anise, and buttered aromas. This massive, medium-to-full-bodied, and dense wine displays layers of spice, creamy super-ripe pears, creme brulee, and hints of butterscotch in its opulent flavor profile. Velvety-textured and broad, it is forward yet better balanced than originally perceived. Drink it between 2002 and 2012.

On the palate, it marvelously combines the powerful, ripe fruit characteristic of the vintage with magnificent delineation and elegance.  This soy sauce, licorice, flower, as well as blackberry flavored wine is dense and concentrated, yet lace-like and gloriously precise.  It stands, as is expected given its rarity, price, and reputation, as one of the stars of the vintage.  Projected maturity: 2001-2012+.

This superb wine offers a mouthful of silky-textured cherries, blueberries, plums, boysenberries, earth, minerals, and spiced oak. This masterpiece is full-bodied, dense (yet extremely elegant and defined), thickly-textured, and immensely concentrated. Moreover, I sensed this wine was holding a significant amount in reserve!

It is intensely profound, and super-ripe yet harmonious. Its extraordinarily long finish (it tails off with a sweet kirsch kiss) flabbergasted me. I could not help but think of the finishes of two wines I love - Chateau Rayas and Chateau Lafleur. It appears to be holding an enormous amount in reserve, and may ultimately merit higher ratings.

Simply put, this is a mind-boggling, virtually perfect wine. It displays breath-taking aromas of liquid minerals, creamed hazelnuts, candied chestnuts (marrons glaces), white flowers, anise, and buttered toast that seem to gain in expressiveness and intensity with time. On its utterly extraordinary palate layer upon layer of stones, straw, minerals, grilled bread, and sweet white flowers can be found. Oily, full-bodied, magnificently concentrated, and extracted, this is as complex a wine as I have ever had the honor to pour over my lips and palate. Perfectly balanced and structured for the long haul, this wine also possesses one of the longest and purist finishes I have ever encountered. A winemaking tour de force!

1894,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1994 Montrachet, from 25 hectoliter/hectare yields, has a deep mineral spice on the nose with touches of star anise and orange blossoms. In the mouth, it displays an awesome silky texture and good length, with touches of nuts and spices. This full-bodied wine has the components to be a great Montrachet, but it lacks the necessary drive to carry the fruit through to its summit. My impression is that this wine will age gracefully for 10+ years. The most expensive dry white wine made in the world, the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti's Montrachet always faces high, if not unrealistic expectations. The gracious Aubert de Villaine, one of the owners of the domaine, was kind enough to allow me to taste the 1994 and 1995 Montrachet's side by side.

1895,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"There is something restrained and monolithic about the DRC's 1985 Montrachet.  Obviously made from extremely low yields given its thickness and richness, this full-bodied wine reveals a lack of complexity.  Admittedly, this is being super-critical, but at $600 a bottle, shouldn't one be just a bit moved by the tasting experience?  The wine is unquestionably outstanding, and it may be a long distance runner that needs more time to develop.  As the 1985 white Burgundy vintage has matured, it is interesting to hear some producers say that the wines are ""too clean"" and ""too healthy.""  Nevertheless, this young, light to medium straw-colored Montrachet appears to require another decade of aging before a more realistic assessment can be made on where this wine is going.  It is still young, but I am not fully convinced that age will bring out all the complexity one would expect.  (Over the holidays, a Niellon 1985 Batard-Montrachet was profound, and clearly a mid-90-point effort.)

1896,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Most 1982 white Burgundies have long been in decline, thus this was a very strong showing for the extremely unctuous, honeyed, high alcohol 1982 Montrachet from Romanee-Conti.  Light golden in color, it still possessed gorgeously thick and succulent layers of buttery, popcorn-like fruit.  Extremely potent, this is a powerful, slightly fragile style of Montrachet that should drink well for another 10-15 years.

1897,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanee-Conti is extremely backward, tightly knit, and closed, with hard tannin, an excellent to outstanding mouthfeel, and a nearly impenetrable personality.  Although this is usually a fragrant, intensely-perfumed wine, the closed, tight 1993 exhibits few aromatics, medium body, and huge tannin.  It needs 8-10 years of cellaring.  While it will last 25-30 years, it is tough to judge just how good this wine will be.  The score reflects the vineyard and historic reputation as much as what I was able to taste in the bottle.
The DRC's 1993s possess the vintage's toughness, tannic structure, austerity, and aging potential.  They will not be flattering to drink in their youth, and most will require 6-10 years of cellaring.

The color is a disturbingly light to medium ruby.  The wine's aromatics exhibit oak, smoke, and vanilla, but little fruit.  No amount of coaxing or breathing enhances the wine's bouquet, which appears to crack up with exposure to air.

The most controversial vintage over the last several decades, the 1983 reveals a dark ruby/garnet color with noticeable lightening at the edge.  The intoxicatingly perfumed bouquet offers up intense aromas of earth, mushrooms, sweet, overripe black-raspberry fruit, prunes, smoke, and Asian spices.  The complex aromatics are followed by a powerful, tannic, highly concentrated wine with immense body, some astringency, and a huge, alcoholic, rich, glycerin-dominated finish.

Those millionaires lucky enough to have access to this rarity, frequently the most concentrated Chardonnay made in the world, should be pleased with the 1991 and 1990.  The 1991 Le Montrachet is a fat, unctuously-styled wine made from yields of only 32 hectoliters per hectare.  Although rich, it does not have the depth and power of vintages such as 1990, 1989, and 1986.  Soft and precocious because of low acidity, it should be drunk over the next decade.

NOTE:  I recently had the good fortune to taste all the DRC Le Montrachet's from 1979 through 1989.  I thought the 1986, followed by 1983, 1979, and 1989, to be show-stoppers.  The 1989 has the potential to be another 1986.  The 1983 is phenomenally powerful and intense.  I also enjoyed the 1982 and 1985, although the latter wine is backward, with high acidity and a monolithic personality.  It will be interesting to see how much complexity develops.

1916,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1990 Le Montrachet exhibits considerable opulence, as well as a tell-tale nose of coconut, buttered apples, and smoky, toasty new oak.  Magnificently deep, expansive, and rich, with moderate acidity, it should prove to be a sensational DRC Le Montrachet.  It is capable of lasting 15-20 years.

The DRC was unhappy with their 1992 and will not produce any Montrachet.  Those millionaires lucky enough to have access to this rarity, frequently the most concentrated Chardonnay made in the world, should be pleased with the 1991 and 1990.  

NOTE:  I recently had the good fortune to taste all the DRC Le Montrachet's from 1979 through 1989.  I thought the 1986, followed by 1983, 1979, and 1989, to be show-stoppers.  The 1989 has the potential to be another 1986.  The 1983 is phenomenally powerful and intense.  I also enjoyed the 1982 and 1985, although the latter wine is backward, with high acidity and a monolithic personality.  It will be interesting to see how much complexity develops.

This wine continues to rank as one of the most memorable white wines I have ever tasted.  The only criticism may be its heavy-weight style.  The light golden color is followed by a nose that zooms from the glass, offering a phenomenal fragrance of honey, smoked nuts, lavishly rich, buttery fruit, and toasty oak.  The wine's viscosity, unctuousness, and extract level are mind-boggling.  It represents the essence of Chardonnay, extremely full-bodied and concentrated, yet remarkably well-balanced in spite of its massive size.

Given the fact that the DRC bottled their wines barrel by barrel until the mid-eighties, tasting notes of older bottles can be particularly misleading because of the obvious bottle variation.  This bottling, from an outstanding red burgundy vintage, offers a barnyard, cow manure-sort of aroma intermingled with sweet fruit in the background.  In the mouth, the wine exhibits full body and significant tannin, as well as extremely high acidity.  The result is a wine with plenty of depth, but the high acidity and hard tannins give it a lean, austere impression that is atypical for a DRC wine.",,RP 85

A decadent, stunning perfume of smoked meats, herbs, oriental spices and sweet jammy fruit exhibited no signs of fatigue or oxidation.

Long-time readers know that I am often much more critical of older wines than many other writers.  To merit high ratings, an older wine must still be fully alive with its personality intact.  With that in mind, I have to say that the 1929 DRC Richebourg is one of the most extraordinary wines I have ever tasted.  A medium garnet color reveals orange and rust at the edge.  The wine remains intact, with a compelling fragrance.  A huge nose of smoked duck, herbs, sweet fruits, licorice, and truffles soars from the glass.  This wine, which has refused to let go of any of its sweet jammy fruit, reveals an unctuous, opulent texture, and a chewy, alcoholic, fleshy finish.  The word from Burgundy's old timers was that the 1929s were gorgeous young, but would not keep.  At age sixty-three, this is as riveting a red wine as I have ever drunk.  I should mention that this bottle had been re-corked several years ago at the domaine.",,RP 85
1922,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1990 Romanee-Conti should ultimately be the most compelling and complex of the DRC wines.  Normally it possesses a lighter color than either La Tache or Richebourg, but in 1990 it boasts a surprisingly saturated color that is the equal of La Tache and Richebourg.  The nose offers up sweet, clove, cinnamon, and blackberry aromas intermingled with toasty, smoky new oak.  Lavishly rich and full-bodied, with abundant tannins, this profound, surprisingly large-scaled, tannic wine boasts more muscle than usual.  Let's hope that the billionaires that buy it have as much taste as money.  Anticipated maturity: 2000-2025 . 

The DRC 1990s, all of which were bottled in April/May, are among the deepest colored wines from this domaine that I have tasted in the last decade.  Moreover, they are firmly structured, with significant tannins from both the vintage and from the aging in 100% new oak barrels.  For the fortunate few who have had the discretionary income to afford the other great vintages of the DRC from the eighties, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1988, and 1989, the question is - are the 1990s superior?  I am not sure they are any better than the 1980s, 1985, and 1988s, but they undoubtedly represent a classic, concentrated, long-lived style of wine.  Moreover, all of these wines should have a more graceful evolution and broader window of drinkability than the tannic 1988s, as well as potentially greater longevity than the succulent and opulent 1985s.

The only thing I have ever seen from the new world that approaches a wine such as this in nectar-like richness were the 1978 and 1980 Chalone, but that winery has now resorted to making much lighter, more commercially-oriented products.  There is nothing commercial about this 1989 Montrachet.  If you have $500 to spend, here is a bottle that will offer an awesome nose of honeyed, buttery, apple fruit, intertwined with aromas of smoked nuts and toasty new oak.  In the mouth, it is almost greasy because of its extraordinary viscosity, thickness, and richness.  The finish is explosive, and while the alcohol must be over 14.5%, it cannot be detected because of the wine's phenomenal concentration.

Perhaps because one so rarely encounters this old-style, tannic type of burgundy, it is tempting to dismiss it as too hard and tough.
