0,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 Screaming Eagle soars out of the glass with vibrant notions of ripe blackberries, black cherries and fresh red and black currants plus wafts of licorice, candied violets, cedar chest and clove oil with a beguiling touch of sea spray. Medium-bodied with jaw-dropping elegance, the palate is finely textured and yet built like a brick house with a super taut backbone and exquisitely knit acidity. The intense black and red fruit flavors are accented by layers of mineral and floral notions, finishing with incredible length and depth. Undeniably stunning.",,RP 100
1,Screaming Eagle,The Flight,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 The Flight drifts sensuously out of the glass with the most gorgeous perfume of red roses, kirsch, black raspberries and fresh blackcurrants followed by hints of iron ore, tilled soil, lavender and star anise plus a touch of powdered cinnamon. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a fantastically chiseled structure of ripe, grainy tannins and bold freshness supporting the black fruit and floral layers, finishing with bags of minerals.",,RP 100
2,Screaming Eagle,Sauvignon Blanc,"The 2017 Sauvignon Blanc is 100% Sauvignon Blanc, coming from a small section of estate vines closer to the Napa river. It is entirely fermented in French oak, but only about 5% is new. The grapes are pressed straight to barrels and kept on their gross lees. The wine is fermented using native yeasts. This vintage, the nose is not at all shy—it comes bounding out of the glass with exuberant scents of ripe peaches, passion fruit and musk perfume plus wafts of honeycomb, elderflower, ripe gooseberries and lemongrass with a waft of Bosc pears. The palate is super intense and yet ethereally weighted, light-bodied and oh-so-fine, elegant and refreshing, featuring a whole array of  chalk and sea spray sparks, creating a shimmer to all the many citrus and stone fruit layers, finishing with great length and energy. There is a truly interesting phenolic texture to the palate that reminds me of some Chardonnays, particularly Burgundian examples. Winemaker Nick Gislason commented that the gross lees contain a lot of phenolic content, which is where the wine picks up that textural component. Love it!",,RP 100
3,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 2016 Screaming Eagle is, as usual, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon with a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple colored, it leaps from the glass with bright, exuberant blackberries, kirsch and warm blackcurrants scents plus touches of lavender, roses, tilled black loam, wild sage and dark chocolate with wafts of yeast extract, underbrush and crushed rocks. Medium to full-bodied, firm and fine grained, with amazing freshness, it is layered with crunchy black and red fruits, sparked by floral and mineral notions and finishing with epic length and depth.",,RP 100
4,Screaming Eagle,The Flight,"Composed roughly of two-thirds Merlot with 5% Cabernet Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, the medium to deep colored 2016 The Flight opens with bold, expressive notions of wild blueberries, warm plums and boysenberries with touches of black raspberries, spice cake, violets, dark chocolate and potpourri with a hint of menthol. Full-bodied, rich, spicy and jam-packed with energy, it has beautifully plush tannins texturing the multilayered blue and black fruits, delivering a very long, perfumed finish.",,RP 100
5,Screaming Eagle,Sauvignon Blanc,"The 2016 Sauvignon Blanc comes from two acres that were harvested in two passes this year. It has a very subtle nose of honeysuckle, peach blossoms and lemongrass giving way to exponentially growing scents of lime cordial, pineapple pastry and jasmine with wafts of fresh ginger and coriander seed. Medium to full-bodied with a seductively satiny texture and layer upon layer of citrus and tropical flavors, it delivers a gorgeous backbone of freshness and a very long, perfumed, finish. A style built for ageing, I can see this developing over 5-10 years into a richer, honeyed toast and preserved peaches style, and therefore, it may warrant a higher score in years to come.",,RP 100
6,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Medium to deep garnet colored, the 2007 Screaming Eagle opens with a dazzlingly beautiful fragrance of red roses, violets and lavender over a core of red currant jelly, kirsch, cassis and black raspberry layers plus blueberry preserves and stewed tea accents and a waft of cigar box. Medium to full-bodied, the tannins are firm yet wonderfully plush with a great intensity of perfumed red and blue fruits that are at once intense and ethereal, finishing on a lingering mineral note. This 2007 truly shows the personality of Screaming Eagle at its best. It is approachable now, still possessing plenty of primary fruit with those tertiary layers beginning to unfurl and therefore it cannot fail to impress even at this youthful stage. However, give it another 5-7 years to really get the full dividends of careful cellaring.",,RP 100
7,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Composed of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the very deep purple-black colored 2015 Screaming Eagle leaps from the glass with notes of freshly crushed black currants, black cherries and blackberries with suggestions of cigar box, black raspberries, red currants, chocolates, pencil lead and cast-iron pan plus a touch of potpourri. Medium to full-bodied with a rock-solid backbone of ripe, grainy tannins and oodles of freshness, it features the most incredible black and red fruit layers and finishes with incredible vibrancy and depth.",,RP 100
8,Screaming Eagle,The Flight,"Very deep purple-black, the 2015 The Flight (a blend of 61% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon) opens with electric notes of black and blue fruit sparks—wild blueberries, fresh blackberries and crushed black plums—with nuances of lavender, violets, pencil shavings, tilled soil, yeast extract and a waft of cinnamon stick. Medium to full-bodied, it hits the palate with tons of energy and freshness supported by firm, finely grained tannins, finishing with tons of fragrant earth layers.",,RP 100
9,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"Very deep purple-black, the 2014 Second Flight (composed of 57% Merlot and 43% Cabernet Sauvignon with no Cabernet Franc) is a little closed at this youthful stage, offering glimpses of blueberry compote, blackberry pie and cassis notions with touches of garrigue, bay leaves, black truffles, rose hips and underbrush plus a hint of wood smoke. Medium-bodied, the palate delivers wonderful freshness, with very firm, very finely grained tannins and layers of vibrant black fruits, finishing on a profound minerally note. With this vintage, we can see something of a stylistic departure, offering an expression of Merlot that is bright, refreshing, elegant and perfumed, and it is perhaps more similar to Screaming Eagle in terms of style than it has ever been. Beautiful!",,RP 100
10,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"Very deep garnet-purple colored, the 2013 Second Flight simply sings of spiced blueberries, black forest cake and preserved plums with suggestions of star anise, baker’s chocolate, fertile loam and dried Provence herbs with a hint of lavender. Big, concentrated, full-bodied and packed to the gills with black fruits, exotic spice and floral layers, it has a firm frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, finishing with epic length and loads of layers. Still very taut, it needs at least another 2-3 years in bottle. Interestingly, this full-on hedonistic vintage has one of the largest Merlot contributions ever for this wine: 65% Merlot with 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Cabernet Franc.",,RP 100
11,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"Composed of 43% Merlot, 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Cabernet Franc and with a very deep garnet-purple color, the 2012 Second Flight has an enticingly savory nose with notes of smoked meats, yeast extract, tapenade and truffles over a core of crème de cassis and plum preserves plus a touch of Indian spices. Full-bodied, rich and concentrated in the mouth, it has firm, velvety tannins and plenty of background freshness supporting the generous fruit, finishing long and spicy.",,RP 100
12,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"Deep garnet colored, the 2011 Second Flight (a blend of 54% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc) offers up a gorgeous perfume of wilted roses and violets over a core of blackberry tart, raspberry preserves and kirsch with subtle baking spices and garrigue notions. Medium to full-bodied with a solid frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, it has wonderfully perfumed layers and an exotic spice-laced finish. It has a surprising amount of weight and concentration for this cool, rainy vintage. Winemaker Nick Gislason informed me that the last pick was on November 1 this year—which is extremely late! But this later harvest clearly paid off when you consider how ripe the tannins are on this beauty.",,RP 100
13,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"Composed of 26% Merlot, 61% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Cabernet Franc, this is the first vintage made by Nick Gislason. Deep garnet in color, the 2010 Second Flight delivers slowly evolving notions of baked plums, crème de cassis and mocha with hints of unsmoked cigars, cedar chest and beef dripping plus a waft of sandalwood. Full-bodied and packed with rich, savory-laced black fruit preserves, the palate features velvety tannins and seamless freshness, finishing very long. Drinking beautifully now but should keep for 15+ years.",,RP 100
14,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 2014 Screaming Eagle is an 880-case blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc. The telltale sign of this iconic wine is its extraordinary purity of crème de cassis fruit, which is displayed abundantly in the 2014. It doesn’t quite have the structure and mass of the 2013, but this sexy, up-front, opaque ruby/purple-colored wine is seamlessly constructed, full-bodied, and has a long finish with silky tannins. This seems to float across that palate with that great fruit purity that is a characteristic of Screaming Eagle. Drink it over the next 25+ years.",,RP 100
15,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 2013 Screaming Eagle flagship wine is a blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc. As one might expect, the purity of the cassis, which is always a hallmark of this estate and wine, is well-displayed in this beauty. Dense purple in color, it offers up some floral notes intermixed with damp earth, blackcurrant jam, blackberry and hints of licorice and incense. This reminds me somewhat of the 2010 Screaming Eagle. Full-bodied, rich, but perfectly balanced, it’s another terrific example of this iconic estate. It should drink well for 30 or more years.",,RP 100
16,Screaming Eagle,Sauvignon Blanc,"My first look at Screaming Eagle’s super-expensive, rare 2013 Sauvignon Blanc left me somewhat desirous of more character and intensity, so I’m perplexed about the pricing. The wine is certainly crisp and dry, with notes of grapefruit as well as a touch of delicate peach and honeysuckle, but there’s nothing terribly special about it, and I can think of a dozen or so Sauvignon Blancs made in nearby vineyards that are richer, more complex, and just better wines at much lower price points. That said, it’s a very good effort, but the pricing is absurd.",,RP 100
17,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The perfect 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Screaming Eagle is composed of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. Made in the classic, iconic Screaming Eagle style that the original proprietress, Jean Philipps, first showcased in the early 1990s, before the winery was sold to Stan Kroenke, the inky/purple-colored, seamless 2012 possesses an extraordinary set of aromatics consisting of pure blackcurrant liqueur, licorice, acacia flowers, graphite and a subtle hint of new oak. Full-bodied, opulent and voluptuous, this profound wine is as prodigious as I thought it would be last year when tasted from barrel. It should age effortlessly for 20 or more years.",,RP 100
18,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Aged 20 months in 72% new French oak, this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc comes from a great vineyard on the valley floor in Oakville, just south of Rudd Estate and Plumpjack. The wine’s dense ruby/purple color is followed by a beautiful, Pauillac-like (think Pontet Canet or Mouton), ethereal perfume of creme de cassis, or as Michael Broadbent used to say, “celestial black currants,” full body, a velvety texture, fine tannins, a multidimensional mouthfeel, and a terrific finish. While there were no real surprises tasting this wine, I was somewhat intrigued by just how youthful the 2004 Screaming Eagle is showing. I had expected it to reveal slightly more evolution. I thought the 13% Merlot in the blend would push the evolution more quickly. The finish lasts for a full minute. As it has been in just about every vintage, the 2004 is a profound wine. It is for others to decide if it is overpriced, but this is undeniably a great wine that competes on the world stage with the best that exist.

19,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Made from a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, the 2011 Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon is a sexy, upfront, precociously styled wine exhibiting a dense ruby/purple color as well as lots of licorice, camphor, black currant jam, new oak and spice box characteristics. Dense, rich and impressive, the early drinking charm of the 2011 vintage gives it immediate appeal. It should keep for 10-15 years.  

Under the ownership of Stan Kroenke, this vineyard has been replanted and a new cellar has been constructed. The production of Screaming Eagle has remained between 700-1,000 cases, and a second wine, the Second Flight, includes 520-800 cases. The introduction of a second wine is an attempt to keep Screaming Eagle at its mythical level of quality. This vineyard, situated on the valley floor at the Oakville Crossroads across the road from the Rudd Estate, encompasses 60 acres, but only a small percentage is used for these two cuvees.  Based on the three vintages I tasted, it appears the Second Flight wines include much less Cabernet Sauvignon and more Merlot than the flagship Screaming Eagle.

Opulent and full-bodied with a multidimensional personality, gorgeous purity and a stunning, flawless texture, this spectacular wine is among the wines of the vintage.

This beautiful, dense, full-bodied 2009 is exceptionally elegant, pure and seamless. Drink it over the next 20-25 years.

It is meant to be drunk early on, but it should easily keep 10-15 years because of its balance.

23,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"This 2003 was showing spectacularly well, and based on my recollection, I think I may have liked it even more than the 2002, which is the reverse of how I felt a decade ago. One of the biggest (14.6% alcohol) wines made by Screaming Eagle during this period, it boasts an opaque ruby/purple color as well as classic, pure, creme de cassis, cedarwood and hints of Asian soy sauce and forest floor notes. The multidimensional aromatics are followed by a full-bodied, silky-textured, opulent, rich, atypically big wine that is impeccably well-balanced. It is just starting to come into its own. Four to five more years in the cellar will prove magical, and this 2003 is one of the candidates for the wine of the vintage. It should last another 20+ years.

24,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The estate’s 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon bursts from the glass with considerable richness and pure depth. The spring frosts lowered yields noticeably resulting in a wine that is a bit darker and heavier than is the norm. The rest of the vintage was on the warmer side, which gave the wine much of its ripeness and body. Mocha, espresso, licorice and sweet spices all wrap around the palate. Next to the other wines in this tasting, the 2008 is a bit burly. The mind-bending finesse of the best vintages is missing. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2028.  

I have had a number of fabulous tastings at Screaming Eagle, but this was one of the most memorable. The biggest news at Screaming Eagle is the release of a second wine, a project that has been in the works for a number of years. Owner Stan Kroenke and his team wanted to make sure their new wine was up to the estate’s standards, and have only released the first vintages over the last few months. I tasted all four vintages of Screaming Eagle’s second label, Second Flight, next to Screaming Eagle itself, which allowed for a fascinating set of comparisons of both wines across a number of vintages. Like its big brother, Second Flight is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine, but here the Merlot plays a much more significant role. Regardless, what comes through most is the signature of these sites as seen through the lenses of the respective vintages. Readers might also enjoy taking a look at a recent video I shot with Winemaker Nic Gislason during the 2012 harvest that we recently posted on our site.

25,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"The 2008 Second Flight emerges from the glass with black cherries, plums, mocha, espresso and chocolate. This is an especially round, rich vintage for Second Flight. All the elements are in the right place, but overall, 2008 does not appear to be one of the estate’s very finest years. Of course, that is in relative terms. The 2008 is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon and 47% Merlot. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2028.

26,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"The essence of this generous, voluptuous vintage comes through loud and clear in the 2007 Second Flight. A jewel of a wine, the 2007 is endowed with gorgeous depth and tons of personality. Raspberry jam, freshly cut flowers and licorice all flow through to a deep, enveloping finish that is pure 2007. This is another great showing from Screaming Eagle. In 2007 the blend is 59% Cabernet Sauvignon and 41% Merlot. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022.

27,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon is stunning. A wine that is only now beginning to shed its tannin, the 2006 stands out for its vibrancy and energy. All of the classic Screaming Eagle notes are in the glass, but with a little more edge and cut than in most vintages. Sweet red berries, crushed rocks, flowers and spice box are alive in the glass. Over time, hints of sage, mint rosemary and pencil shavings add complexity. The 2006 is a decidedly cool-weather wine with less opulence than either the 2007 or 2009, but it is absolutely singing today. Another few years will only help the wine come together even more fully, but it is impossible to miss the 2006’s utterly breathtaking beauty. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2026.

28,Screaming Eagle,Second Flight,"The 2006 Second Flight is a beautiful classy wine. Here the significant presence of Merlot (33%) helps to round out the Cabernet Sauvignon that is so distinctive in Screaming Eagle. Overall, this is a fairly generous expression of the year with plenty of the estate’s signatures. Over time, a compelling melange of savory herbs, spices and minerals comes alive in the glass. This is a super-impressive first vintage for Second Flight. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

29,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"Beautiful floral notes intermixed with creme de cassis, licorice and charcoal jump from the glass of this dense purple-colored 2002. Opulent, broad, full-bodied and more mature than I expected given how this wine showed in its youth, this deep, rich Cabernet Sauvignon is exceptional. However, in this vintage it has to take a back seat to a number of other cuvees. The final blend was 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc.

30,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The last time I had this wine, it seemed much more developed, youthful and approachable. This particular bottle, which was pulled from my cellar, was super-powerful, dense and concentrated, as well as structured and backward. Aeration helped somewhat, but this looks like a very long-lived wine, and my initial suggestion of an anticipated maturity date (2010-2025) should be changed to 2015-2035.  Only 450 cases were made of this blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc from former proprietor Jean Phillips’ vineyards just south of the Oakville crossroads. The spectacular dense blue/purple color remains opaque. The wine displays the hallmark creme de cassis, floral and licorice notes that are so pure, vivid and intense, and which have always been part of this vineyard’s classic trademark. With great purity, a full-bodied mouthfeel and even more thickness, power and density than I remember, this wine has put on weight, developed more structure, and looks like a candidate for 30 more years of aging potential. This is a brilliant wine, much in keeping with the legendary status of this producer.

31,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon, which I loved last year, has gotten even better, something I saw across the board with the bottled 2005s (a superb year for Bordeaux varietals). This blend of 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Cabernet Franc was aged in 67% new French oak for 21 months. It possesses a gorgeous, Pauillac-like bouquet of cedar, creme de cassis, licorice, smoke, and earth as well as sweet tannins, full body, fabulous layers of fruit, a noble sweetness, and outstanding length. This 2005 can be drunk now or cellared for 25+ years.  

As I wrote last year, original proprietor, Jean Phillips, has moved on, and the new sheriff in town is Charles Banks, who also owns the up and coming superstar, Santa Ynez winery, Jonata. A lot is going on at Screaming Eagle as much of the 54-acre vineyard is being replanted, and a new wine cellar is under construction. Production for the following three vintages runs from a low of 400 cases of the 2005, to approximately 800-900 for the 2007, which is their projected target for future vintages. It will be interesting to see if the $750 a bottle price holds up given the global economic crisis. Certainly, there is no doubting the quality. Beginning with the proprietor, Screaming Eagle has an amazing winemaking team in place, including day to day winemaker Andy Erickson, who is backed up by the globe-trotting Bordelais consultant, Michel Rolland

It boasts an opaque purple color along with a gorgeously pure nose of creme de cassis, charcoal, and floral characteristics. The wine is opulent, dense, and rich, with exceptional purity, a viscous texture, and impressive underlying tannin that frames its large but elegant personality. Not surprisingly, this is a candidate for the wine of the vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2020.

It boasts a saturated ruby/purple color in addition to an expressive bouquet of cassis, minerals, and smoke. This multi-textured, round wine exhibits sweet, well-integrated tannin, a great mid-palate and finish, as well as spectacular purity and palate presence. Consume it now and over the next 15-20 years.  

There are 500 cases of this wine. As most readers know, this wine has become the ultimate collector's Cabernet Sauvignon, routinely fetching $800 to as much as $2000 a bottle at wine auctions. Of course, this makes no sense to me or Screaming Eagle's owner, the amiable Jean Phillips, who sells the wine for $125 a bottle. Unquestionably an exquisite wine, it offers remarkably rich creme de cassis aromas and flavors in an unmanipulated, compelling fashion. The winemaking is assisted by well-known consultant Heidi Barrett. From the red, iron-rich soils of the Oakville District, the wine is aged in 65% new French oak for 18-20 months.

34,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"It doesn't get any better than 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon, a perfect wine.  Representing the essence of cassis liqueur intermixed with blackberries, minerals, licorice, and toast, this full-bodied, multi-dimensional classic is fabulous, with extraordinary purity, symmetry, and a finish that lasts for nearly a minute.  It has the overall equilibrium to evolve for nearly two decades, but it will be hard to resist upon release.  Anticipated maturity: now-2020.  Tel.  (707) 944-0749; Fax (707) 944-9271",,RP 100
35,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The newly-released 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon reveals lots of structure, an opaque purple color, and the hallmark blackberry and cassis liqueur-like notes.  Silky-textured, fabulously-concentrated, and gorgeously-balanced, it has every component part - acidity, alcohol, tannin, and extract - flawlessly presented.  Anticipated maturity: 2002-2020.

36,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 1995 Cabernet Sauvignon is as close to a perfect wine as I could hope to taste. This opaque purple-colored wine exhibits a sensational purity of black currant fruit, intermixed with a notion of raspberries, violets, and well-disguised sweet vanillin. Full-bodied, with remarkable intensity, exquisite symmetry, and a mid-palate and finish to die for, this is a compelling, astonishingly seductive Cabernet Sauvignon that can be drunk now, or cellared for 20-25 years. I may have done this wine a disservice by not giving it the big 3-digit score.

As I have tried so hard to articulate in past reviews, what makes these wines so stunning is the black currant/cassis fruit. Screaming Eagle may be the most extravagantly pure and rich expression of cassis one can find ... short of drinking cassis liqueur. There is an unbelievable purity to these wines, as well as phenomenal concentration and richness, yet in no sense are they heavy, ponderous, or out of balance. Tel.

37,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon is performing even better this year than it was last. I still believe the 1995 has a slight edge, but that may be more noticeable 8-10 years from now than at present. The opaque purple-colored 1994's forward, gorgeously-scented nose offers up a smorgasbord of black fruits, along with a subtle dosage of toasty oak and minerals. Full-bodied, with a seamless, lush texture, this is a profoundly generous wine with everything going for it. The finish lasts for 35 seconds. As gorgeous as it is, this wine can be drunk young, or cellared for 20-25 years. What makes Screaming Eagle such an extraordinary wine is its remarkably sweet, lavishly rich, opulently-textured, super-extracted black currant and black cherry fruitiness. Moreover, they are admirably pure, layered, velvety, and accessible. As delicious as these wines are young, they should age for 20 or more years, because of their extraordinary equilibrium.

As with so many of these wines, the only way to latch onto a bottle or two is to get on the winery's mailing list.

38,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"The 1993 Cabernet Sauvignon is a remarkable wine, not dissimilar from the 1992. The 1993 reveals an opaque purple color, as well as a rich, jammy, pure nose of blackcurrant/cassis fruit intertwined with scents of minerals and high quality, spicy oak. The wine offers a cascade of lavishly rich, opulently textured, super-extracted fruit that is beautifully buttressed by oak and sweet tannin. Remarkably long, pure, and rich, this is a compelling Cabernet Sauvignon with no hard edges. Perfectly balanced, marvelously concentrated, and exciting, look for this wine to drink well young, but keep for 25 years.
As exciting as these wines are, as a critic, my emotions are mixed because of the extremely limited quantities available. My advice - get on the winery's mailing list as quantities will be more abundant starting in 1996.
This microscopic winery located near the Oakville Crossroads, just below Dalla Valle, created quite a stir among the handful of Cabernet lovers who were able to latch onto a bottle when proprietor Jean Phillips released her debut wine - the 1992. The wine is sold exclusively via a mailing list. On the few occasions I have been fortunate enough to taste it, the 1992 Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon has been inching toward a three-digit score. It is unquestionably one of the greatest Cabernet Sauvignons I have tasted. From a quantitative perspective, the news on future availability is depressing. Because of phylloxera, there are only 135 cases of the 1993 Cabernet Sauvignon (a worthy candidate for wine of the vintage), 175 cases of the 1994, and a whopping 225 cases of the 1995. However, with new plantings coming into production, the outlook will improve; 500 cases of the 1996 will be made. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, and 3% Cabernet Franc, this wine is made by winemaker/consultant Heidi Barrett. Before his death, Gustav Dalla Valle also provided considerable input.

39,Screaming Eagle,Screaming Eagle,"This small operation is located just below the Dalla Valle vineyard near the Oakville Cross.  Screaming Eagle's Cabernet Sauvignons are going to create quite a stir among lovers of that varietal - if they are able to latch onto a bottle or two.  The estate is owned by Tony Bowden and Jean Phillips, one of Napa Valley's leading real estate agents.  With the help of Heidi Barrett and Gustav Dalla Valle,  this operation's debut vintage is the extraordinary 1992 Cabernet Sauvignon, one of the greatest young Cabernets I have ever tasted.  The wine is bottled unfined and unfiltered, and aged in 60% new oak.  It is only sold via a mailing list, so readers who want to taste one of the most exciting young wines being produced should get on the list.  The 175 cases of the 1992 are followed by only 130 cases of the 1993, and a tiny quantity of 1994, as the last two vintages were even smaller in crop size.  At present, the 1992 can be bought at the following Napa Valley locations: the restaurants Don Giovanni and Brava, and at the St. Helena Wine Center and Oakville Grocery.  Don't dilly-dally around on this one.
The 1992 Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon is exceptionally impressive.  The wine's opaque purple color is followed by a sensational nose of jammy blackcurrants and subtle toasty oak.  As stunning as the aromatics are, the wine reveals even greater richness and intensity on the palate, offering up layers of stunningly proportioned, ripe, intense fruit, full body, great purity, and an inner-core of sweet, creamy, highly extracted blackcurrant/cassis fruit.  The tannin is nearly concealed behind the massive extract and richness.  All the component parts are brilliantly focused and in balance.  The finish is awesome!  This is a spectacular debut release that should age effortlessly for 20 years.

40,Domaine Duroche,Screaming Eagle,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 Screaming Eagle soars out of the glass with vibrant notions of ripe blackberries, black cherries and fresh red and black currants plus wafts of licorice, candied violets, cedar chest and clove oil with a beguiling touch of sea spray. Medium-bodied with jaw-dropping elegance, the palate is finely textured and yet built like a brick house with a super taut backbone and exquisitely knit acidity. The intense black and red fruit flavors are accented by layers of mineral and floral notions, finishing with incredible length and depth. Undeniably stunning.",,RP 100
41,Domaine Duroche,The Flight,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 The Flight drifts sensuously out of the glass with the most gorgeous perfume of red roses, kirsch, black raspberries and fresh blackcurrants followed by hints of iron ore, tilled soil, lavender and star anise plus a touch of powdered cinnamon. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a fantastically chiseled structure of ripe, grainy tannins and bold freshness supporting the black fruit and floral layers, finishing with bags of minerals.",,RP 100
42,Domaine Duroche,Sauvignon Blanc,"The 2017 Sauvignon Blanc is 100% Sauvignon Blanc, coming from a small section of estate vines closer to the Napa river. It is entirely fermented in French oak, but only about 5% is new. The grapes are pressed straight to barrels and kept on their gross lees. The wine is fermented using native yeasts. This vintage, the nose is not at all shy—it comes bounding out of the glass with exuberant scents of ripe peaches, passion fruit and musk perfume plus wafts of honeycomb, elderflower, ripe gooseberries and lemongrass with a waft of Bosc pears. The palate is super intense and yet ethereally weighted, light-bodied and oh-so-fine, elegant and refreshing, featuring a whole array of  chalk and sea spray sparks, creating a shimmer to all the many citrus and stone fruit layers, finishing with great length and energy. There is a truly interesting phenolic texture to the palate that reminds me of some Chardonnays, particularly Burgundian examples. Winemaker Nick Gislason commented that the gross lees contain a lot of phenolic content, which is where the wine picks up that textural component. Love it!",,RP 100
43,Domaine Duroche,Screaming Eagle,"The 2016 Screaming Eagle is, as usual, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon with a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple colored, it leaps from the glass with bright, exuberant blackberries, kirsch and warm blackcurrants scents plus touches of lavender, roses, tilled black loam, wild sage and dark chocolate with wafts of yeast extract, underbrush and crushed rocks. Medium to full-bodied, firm and fine grained, with amazing freshness, it is layered with crunchy black and red fruits, sparked by floral and mineral notions and finishing with epic length and depth.",,RP 100
44,Domaine Duroche,The Flight,"Composed roughly of two-thirds Merlot with 5% Cabernet Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, the medium to deep colored 2016 The Flight opens with bold, expressive notions of wild blueberries, warm plums and boysenberries with touches of black raspberries, spice cake, violets, dark chocolate and potpourri with a hint of menthol. Full-bodied, rich, spicy and jam-packed with energy, it has beautifully plush tannins texturing the multilayered blue and black fruits, delivering a very long, perfumed finish.",,RP 100
45,Domaine Duroche,Sauvignon Blanc,"The 2016 Sauvignon Blanc comes from two acres that were harvested in two passes this year. It has a very subtle nose of honeysuckle, peach blossoms and lemongrass giving way to exponentially growing scents of lime cordial, pineapple pastry and jasmine with wafts of fresh ginger and coriander seed. Medium to full-bodied with a seductively satiny texture and layer upon layer of citrus and tropical flavors, it delivers a gorgeous backbone of freshness and a very long, perfumed, finish. A style built for ageing, I can see this developing over 5-10 years into a richer, honeyed toast and preserved peaches style, and therefore, it may warrant a higher score in years to come.",,RP 100
46,Domaine Duroche,Screaming Eagle,"Medium to deep garnet colored, the 2007 Screaming Eagle opens with a dazzlingly beautiful fragrance of red roses, violets and lavender over a core of red currant jelly, kirsch, cassis and black raspberry layers plus blueberry preserves and stewed tea accents and a waft of cigar box. Medium to full-bodied, the tannins are firm yet wonderfully plush with a great intensity of perfumed red and blue fruits that are at once intense and ethereal, finishing on a lingering mineral note. This 2007 truly shows the personality of Screaming Eagle at its best. It is approachable now, still possessing plenty of primary fruit with those tertiary layers beginning to unfurl and therefore it cannot fail to impress even at this youthful stage. However, give it another 5-7 years to really get the full dividends of careful cellaring.",,RP 100
47,Domaine Duroche,Screaming Eagle,"Composed of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the very deep purple-black colored 2015 Screaming Eagle leaps from the glass with notes of freshly crushed black currants, black cherries and blackberries with suggestions of cigar box, black raspberries, red currants, chocolates, pencil lead and cast-iron pan plus a touch of potpourri. Medium to full-bodied with a rock-solid backbone of ripe, grainy tannins and oodles of freshness, it features the most incredible black and red fruit layers and finishes with incredible vibrancy and depth.",,RP 100
48,Domaine Duroche,The Flight,"Very deep purple-black, the 2015 The Flight (a blend of 61% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon) opens with electric notes of black and blue fruit sparks—wild blueberries, fresh blackberries and crushed black plums—with nuances of lavender, violets, pencil shavings, tilled soil, yeast extract and a waft of cinnamon stick. Medium to full-bodied, it hits the palate with tons of energy and freshness supported by firm, finely grained tannins, finishing with tons of fragrant earth layers.",,RP 100
49,Domaine Duroche,Second Flight,"Very deep purple-black, the 2014 Second Flight (composed of 57% Merlot and 43% Cabernet Sauvignon with no Cabernet Franc) is a little closed at this youthful stage, offering glimpses of blueberry compote, blackberry pie and cassis notions with touches of garrigue, bay leaves, black truffles, rose hips and underbrush plus a hint of wood smoke. Medium-bodied, the palate delivers wonderful freshness, with very firm, very finely grained tannins and layers of vibrant black fruits, finishing on a profound minerally note. With this vintage, we can see something of a stylistic departure, offering an expression of Merlot that is bright, refreshing, elegant and perfumed, and it is perhaps more similar to Screaming Eagle in terms of style than it has ever been. Beautiful!",,RP 100
50,Domaine Duroche,Second Flight,"Very deep garnet-purple colored, the 2013 Second Flight simply sings of spiced blueberries, black forest cake and preserved plums with suggestions of star anise, baker’s chocolate, fertile loam and dried Provence herbs with a hint of lavender. Big, concentrated, full-bodied and packed to the gills with black fruits, exotic spice and floral layers, it has a firm frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, finishing with epic length and loads of layers. Still very taut, it needs at least another 2-3 years in bottle. Interestingly, this full-on hedonistic vintage has one of the largest Merlot contributions ever for this wine: 65% Merlot with 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Cabernet Franc.",,RP 100
51,Domaine Duroche,Second Flight,"Composed of 43% Merlot, 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Cabernet Franc and with a very deep garnet-purple color, the 2012 Second Flight has an enticingly savory nose with notes of smoked meats, yeast extract, tapenade and truffles over a core of crème de cassis and plum preserves plus a touch of Indian spices. Full-bodied, rich and concentrated in the mouth, it has firm, velvety tannins and plenty of background freshness supporting the generous fruit, finishing long and spicy.",,RP 100
52,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Deep garnet colored, the 2011 Second Flight (a blend of 54% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc) offers up a gorgeous perfume of wilted roses and violets over a core of blackberry tart, raspberry preserves and kirsch with subtle baking spices and garrigue notions. Medium to full-bodied with a solid frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, it has wonderfully perfumed layers and an exotic spice-laced finish. It has a surprising amount of weight and concentration for this cool, rainy vintage. Winemaker Nick Gislason informed me that the last pick was on November 1 this year—which is extremely late! But this later harvest clearly paid off when you consider how ripe the tannins are on this beauty.",,RP 88
53,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Leroy's brilliant 2019 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis and blackberries mingled with loamy soil, black truffles and orange rind, framed by a deft application of creamy new oak. Full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, it's rich and muscular, with a concentrated core of fruit underpinned a generous endowment of ripe, powdery tannins and concluding with a long, mineral finish.",,RP 88
54,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2019 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is spectacular. Bursting from the glass with aromas of cassis, plums, orange rind and exotic spices, framed by a discreet application of creamy new oak, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and textural, with a velvety attack that segues into a deep, concentrated, layered mid-palate and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 88
55,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2019 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons soars from the glass with aromas of raspberries, cherries, blood orange, black truffle, burning embers and forest floor. Full-bodied, layered and velvety, it's deep and concentrated, with a textural attack that segues into an ample core of vibrant fruit and a long, expansive finish. Sensual and charming, to the extent that there's an ""underrated"" wine chez Leroy, this cuvée is it.",,RP 88
56,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2019 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is rich and unctuous, wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus oil, pear, waxy lemon rind, honeycomb and toasted sesame. Full-bodied, deep and textural, it's rich and enveloping, with a huge core of fleshy fruit underpinned by lively acids and chalky structuring extract.",,RP 88
57,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2019 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières bursts with aromas of raspberries, orange rind, rose petals, forest floor, exotic spices and incense. Full-bodied, layered and sumptuous, with an enveloping core of fruit complemented by sapid, even carnal nuances and framed by melting tannins and lively acids, its depth and plenitude transcend any exceptions for a communal appellation. Indeed, if only more producers Richebourg tasted as good!",,RP 88
58,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2019 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées wafts from the glass with a rich and carnal bouquet of dark berries, plums, exotic spices, smoked meats, rose petals and classy new oak. Full-bodied, ample and fleshy, it's sensual and gourmand, its structuring tannins entirely concealed in a layered, enveloping core of fruit.",,RP 88
59,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2019 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is less extroverted than the brilliant Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, but it's every bit as good. Unwinding in the glass with scents of raspberries, cherries, blood orange and rose petals, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, exhibiting almost crystalline purity of fruit and seamless integration. Concluding with a long, mineral finish, it's a legend in the making.",,RP 88
60,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Offering up aromas of plums, cassis, burning embers, warm spices, rose petals and discreet hints of toasty new oak, Leroy's 2019 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is medium to full-bodied, ample and enveloping, its powdery tannins and lively girdling acids entirely concealed in its layered, multidimensional core of fruit. This is a demonstrative, rather gourmand Santenots that will offer an unusually broad drinking window in this charming vintage.",,RP 88
61,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2019 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes is sumptuous and enveloping, soaring from the glass with aromas of raspberries, cherries and cassis mingled with hints of coniferous forest floor, sweet spices and black truffle. Medium to full-bodied, velvety and seamless, with melting tannins and a vibrant core of fruit, it concludes with a long, expansive finish.",,RP 88
62,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"As readers will remember, when yields are small, Lalou Bize-Leroy opts to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières, and that's the case for her 2019 Nuits-Saint-Georges. Opening in the glass with aromas of sweet red berries, plums, warm spices, loamy soil, black truffle and orange oil, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with a rich core of fruit, supple tannins and a seamless, giving profile.",,RP 88

64,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2019 Pommard Les Vignots began my tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy, and it certainly set a high standard for the wines that followed. Soaring from the glass with scents of raspberries, plums and blackberries mingled with loamy soil, exotic spices and hints of rose petal, it's medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated, with powdery tannins, lively acids and a seamless, sensual profile.",,RP 88
65,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts resents being awaken from its deep sleep, unwinding in the glass and shedding a touch of youthful reduction to reveal a deep bouquet of wild berries, smoked duck, exotic spices, orange rind, peonies and sweet soil tones. Deep, full-bodied and concentrated, it's serious and tightly wound, with striking intensity and length. As I predicted when I last reviewed it, it will require—and requite—patience.",,RP 88
66,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"After a prolonged slumber, the 1996 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is at last beginning to drink beautifully, wafting from the glass with a captivating bouquet of peonies, exotic spices, plummy fruit tones and ineffable carnal nuances. Full-bodied, velvety and layered, it's deep and concentrated, with its racy, vintage-typical spine of acidity cloaked in fruit. Long, penetrating and sapid, it's a real success that's evolving very gracefully. In fact, I suspect that with further bottle age, the gap between the 1996 and the 1993 and 1999 will narrow.",,RP 88
67,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Approaching maturity, Leroy's 1993 Chambertin Grand Cru is a magical wine, wafting from the glass with complex aromas of dark berry fruit, peonies and wilted rose petals, mingled with hints of musk, sweet soil tones and orange rind. Full-bodied, deep and layered, it's still tightly wound, with a racy spine of acidity and fine, powdery tannins framing its core of intensely concentrated fruit. Concluding with a long, perfumed finish, it comes across as a somewhat more brooding, austere stylistic cousin to the stunning 2001 Chambertin—another year when Leroy crafted some of the wines of the vintage.",,RP 88
68,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Richer and rounder than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, Leroy's 2018 Richebourg Grand Cru bursts with aromas of wild berries, exotic spices, hoisin sauce, orange rind and rose petals. Full-bodied, multidimensional and enveloping, it's deep and layered, with velvety tannins and a sumptuous core of fruit. Long and perfumed, it's a head-turningly exotic Richebourg that's built for the ages. It was cropped at a mere 14 hectoliters per hectare.",,RP 88
69,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"""Here's the 1955 at last,"" exclaimed Lalou Bize-Leroy—alluding to the legendary 1955 Maison Leroy Chambertin, the wine she cites as the model for what she aspires to achieve at Domaine Leroy—as we tasted the 2018 Chambertin Grand Cru, and it's hard not to share her enthusiasm. Mingling deep aromas of sweet berries and plums with hints of licorice, peonies, incense and spices, complemented by savory, carnal bass notes, this is a full-bodied, deep and multidimensional wine that's seamless and complete, with a layered core framed by powdery tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, sapid finish. This elegantly muscular and impeccably balanced Chambertin is a wine built for eternity.",,RP 88

Full-bodied and deep, it's layered and concentrated, with a seamless, multidimensional profile, bright animating acids and ripe, powdery tannins. Long and resonant, this is an incipiently dramatic but youthfully tightly wound Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will reward extended bottle age with remarkable aromatic range and textural sumptuousness. Cropped at 11.5 hectoliters per hectare, only 1,160 bottles were produced.",,RP 88
72,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2018 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is spectacular, offering up a deep and carnal bouquet of wild berries, smoked duck and plums mingled with hints of rose hip, warm spices and rich soil tones.

74,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Cropped at a paltry 15 hectoliters per hectare, the 2018 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is a worthy rival to the Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts this year.

75,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2018 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a particular success, offering up aromas of plums, dark berries, smoked meats, hoisin and spices, followed by a full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping palate that's deep and textural, its huge reserves of tannin largely concealed by its generous core of fruit. While that structure imposes itself on the finish, the maturity of the vintage has tempered some of this site's proclivity to youthful reserve—at least for now.",,RP 88
76,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Notes of red berries, wild plums, woodsmoke, sweet soil tones and rose hip introduce Leroy's 2018 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru, a full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine that's velvety and vibrant, with a bright spine of acidity and ripe, powdery tannins.

Like the Clos de Vougeot, this is another of the portfolio's habitually more reserved wines that is—comparatively speaking—unusually demonstrative this year.",,RP 88
79,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of honeyed pears, white flowers, hazelnuts, wet stones, mandarin oil and apricot introduce Leroy's 2018 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine built around lively acids and chalky structuring dry extract.

80,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2000 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a magical bottle that's just beginning to drink very well. Soaring from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of peonies, spices, orange rind, plums, raspberries and smoked tea, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a layered core, lively acids and a long, saline finish. This wine, re-released by the domaine this year, will show brilliantly for more than a decade to come.",,RP 94
81,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 1999 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots shows extraordinarily well, unfurling in the glass with dramatic aromas of wild berries, cinnamon, exotic spices, orange rind and smoked duck. Full-bodied, multidimensional and muscular, it's hugely concentrated, its deep core of fruit framed by an abundance of powdery tannin and racy balancing acids. Long and penetrating, this is a memorable bottle.",,RP 94
82,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 1990 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is deeper, firmer and more muscular than the 2000 that I drank alongside it, but nor could it match its younger sibling for aromatic range, finesse or charm. For the better part of an hour, it showed brilliantly, delivering complex aromas of spices, wild berries, orange rind, plums, smoked meats and creamy oak, but later in the evening, the rather roasted quality that often distinguishes the 1990 red Burgundy vintage became more and more prominent. It's a medium to full-bodied, nicely balanced wine with fine, chalky structuring tannins and tangy acids, but in the final analysis, it couldn't equal the performance of the 2000.",,RP 94
83,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Soaring from the glass with exquisite aromas of rose petals, violets, cassis, raspberries and exotic nuances of clove and cinnamon, Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is full-bodied, velvety and mutlitmiensional, with incredible energy and concentration, concluding with a long and resonant finish. This is a brilliant wine that entirely confirms the fine impression it made when I last tasted it in spring 2018.",,RP 94
84,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Aromas of rich berry fruit, grilled game bird, spices and rose petals introduce Leroy's 2015 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a full-bodied, broad and enveloping wine with a rich core of fruit, ripe acids and powdery tannins.  Deep and concentrated, this Vosne-Romanée is more overtly sun-kissed than the Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières drunk several weeks later, yet the balance is impeccable for the long haul.",,RP 94
85,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones and grilled meats introduce the 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges, a deep and full-bodied wine that's envelopingly textural, its generous core of ripe, expressive fruit largely concealing the wine's powdery structuring tannins. Sapid and earthy, this is classic Nuits that is still not really ready for prime-time drinking.",,RP 94
86,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is still quite tight-knit and reserved, opening in the glass with aromas of cassis and wild plums, mingled with notions of smoked meats, incense, rich soil tones and peonies. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, built around an ample chassis of rich and powdery tannins and underpinned by lively acids. This is a muscular young Clos Vougeot that's long and resonant, but which is at least a decade away from its peak, even if it's sufficiently refined to be approached earlier.",,RP 94
87,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2013 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is a beautiful young wine, offering up aromas of red plums, cassis, smoked duck, exotic spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy but youthfully reserved, with fine-grained tannins, racy acids and a deep, tightly coiled core. While this is sufficiently structurally refined to be approachable now, the real fireworks will come with another decade of bottle age.",,RP 94
88,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is a stunning young wine, unfurling in the decanter and glass to reveal aromas of lemon oil, candle wax, dried white flowers, woodsmoke and a classy framing of noble reduction. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with the chewy, chalky phenolic structure of a red wine, racy acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. This superb Corton-Charlemagne has not merely years  but decades ahead of it.",,RP 94
89,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a tightly wound young wine, unfurling in the glass with scents of wild berries, smoked meats, exotic spices, orange rind and plums. Medium to full-bodied, deep and coiled, it's elegantly muscular, with huge reserves of concentration, lively acids and powdery tannins. Even if it's already very impressive today, this really needs a decade's patience.",,RP 94
90,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières is beginning to drink beautifully, soaring from the glass with an inviting bouquet of rose petals, blackberries, smoked duck, incense and exotic spices. Full-bodied, velvety and spumous, it's layered and textural, underpinned by ripe, powdery tannins and succulent acids.",,RP 94
91,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Wafting from the glass with scents of raspberries, dark chocolate, rose petals, candied peel, incense and grilled squab, the 2008 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is full-bodied, satiny textured and vibrant, its beautifully ripe tannin and tangy acids framing a deep, concentrated core of fruit, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. Anyone who has the chance to taste this wine shouldn't hesitate.",,RP 94
92,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru really blossomed in the decanter, shaking off a touch of reduction to reveal a stunning bouquet of citrus oil—lime, lemon—mingled with oyster shell, white flowers, green pear, nutmeg and wheat toast. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and tight-knit, with a rock-solid core, incisive acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. As usual, this is structured more like a red wine than a white. What's more, it's one of the white wines of the vintage in 2007.",,RP 94
93,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"An elegant rendition of this site, the 2006 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu exhibits pretty aromas of rose petals, cherries and candied peel. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, silky and precise, with a structurally delicate, tender quality so typical of that vintage—but which only foregrounds the wine's beautiful purity of fruit.",,RP 94
94,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Domaine Leroy's 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a brillant young wine, though it's still the better part of a decade away from even early maturity. Unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of black cherries, wild berries, smoked meats, espresso roast, blood orange and exotic spices, framed by a deft touch of new oak, it's full-bodied, deep and layered, with an immensely concentrated core of fruit, elegantly muscular structuring tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, carnal finish.",,RP 94
95,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Lalou Bize-Leroy's 2003 Richebourg Grand Cru is drinking exquisitely well, mingling aromas of plums and sweet red berries with notes of raw cocoa, exotic spices, candied peel, burning embers and subtle hints of smoked meats. Full-bodied, rich and expansive, it's a lavish, dramatic wine, defined by a deep and voluminous core of sumptuous fruit that's framed by velvety tannins and ripe but lively acids, concluding with a long and superbly integrated finish. This a striking, dramatic Richebourg that demonstrates the deftness with which Leroy realized all the potential of this extreme vintage.",,RP 94
96,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"This was the best bottle that I've encountered of Leroy's 1999 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru, unfurling in the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of dark berry fruit, cassis, smoked meats, rose petals, candied peel and sweet spices. Full-bodied, velvety and immensely concentrated, it's seamless and multidimensional, built around an elegantly muscular chassis of velvety tannin and a lively spine of acidity, concluding with a sapid and expansive finish.",,RP 94
97,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the wines of the vintage is the 2017 Musigny Grand Cru, a stunning young wine that reveals a bouquet of immense incipient complexity, mingling notes of raspberries and red fruits with suggestions of blood orange, peonies and rose hips. On the palate, this young Musigny is full-bodied, pure and precise, with an enveloping attack, immense depth at the core and exquisite structural elegance. The finish is long, mineral and beautifully defined. This is the most dynamic of all these young reds from Domaine Leroy, and it will reward considerable patience.",,RP 94
98,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is the least youthfully reductive young white I have ever tasted from Domaine Leroy. Opening in the glass with scents of crisp green pear, lemon oil, white flowers, toasted sesame and struck match, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and incisive, with huge reserves of chalky dry extract that are more reminiscent of a red wine than a white, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. ""This parcel ought to be planted to Pinot Noir,"" observes Madame Bize-Leroy, but I suspect that in such an eventuality the structure of the ensuing red cuvée wouldn't be all that different. Despite that structure and all the wine's energy and tension, this is a comparatively open, expressive vintage for the Domaine's Corton-Charlemagne.",,RP 94
99,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The profound 2017 Chambertin Grand Cru wafts from the glass with a deep and carnal bouquet that mingles rich aromas of blackberries and cassis with notions of summer truffles, smoked meats, espresso roast and baking chocolate. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with the most mid-palate volume of any wine in the cellar—its flesh and texture largely concealing an impressively ample chassis of rich, powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid. This is a decidedly serious Chambertin that will likely gain ground on its 2016 and 2015 siblings with bottle age.",,RP 94
100,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2017 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru reveals a beautiful bouquet of dark wild berries, exotic spices, wilted rose petals and forest floor, discreetly framed by a touch of new oak. It's full-bodied, deep and exquisitely silky, with a concentrated core and supple tannins that caress the palate before giving way to a long, penetrating and pungently perfumed finish. This is a quintessentially elegant, ethereal Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",,RP 94
101,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is showing especially well this year, opening up in the glass with aromas of wild berries, coniferous forest floor, cassis and dark chocolate, framed by a deft application of classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and incisive, with an intense core of fruit, beautifully refined structuring tannins and a long, mineral finish. Finer-boned and more reserved than the Clos de la Roche, this will be worth a special effort to seek out.",,RP 94
102,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Madame Bize-Leroy describes the 2017 Richebourg Grand Cru as ""civilized"", which I interpret to mean that this inherently supple, elegant vintage has tamed some of the climat's tendency to muscular power—an analysis with which I concur. Unwinding in the glass with complex aromas of cassis, dark berries, black truffles, rich soil tones and hints of rose petal and peony, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, with impressive concentration and rich but refined structuring tannins. The finish is long, sapid and perfumed. While I'm often inclined to give the domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant the edge over the Richebourg, the latter's elegance this year makes it more than usually difficult to pick favorites.",,RP 94
103,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"This cuvée is always one of the more powerful, muscular wines in the cellar, and the 2017 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is no exception. Exhibiting complex aromas of smoked meats, dark berries, rich soil tones, cassis, warm spices and black truffles, the wine is full-bodied, deep and structured, with considerable reserves of concentration and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long and mineral finish.",,RP 94
104,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is also spectacular this year, soaring from the glass with a striking bouquet of raspberries, cherries, rose hips, peonies and cinnamon. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and velvety, its envelopingly textural attack segueing into a deep and concentrated core, concluding with a long, precise and elegantly chalky finish.",,RP 94
105,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"One of the highlights of the portfolio this year is the 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts, a serious wine that unwinds in the glass with aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones, pencil lead and complex carnal nuances. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and multidimensional, with formidable depth at the core, an ample chassis of fine structuring tannins and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 94
106,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Notes of cassis, dark wild berries, sweet soil tones, black truffles and incense introduce the 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru, a full-bodied, multidimensional wine that's concentrated, deep and structured, retaining its habitual introverted profile even in this generally open-knit vintage. The finish is long and precise. This is a Clos Vougeot that will merit more than a decade's patience to realize all its potential.",,RP 94
107,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is one of the more brooding, powerful wines in the cellar this year, opening in the glass with notes of cassis, dark berries, smoked duck, spices and coniferous forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and muscular, with powdery structuring tannins, lively acids and a long, carnal finish.",,RP 94
108,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"Notes of cherries, cassis, smoked meats, rich soil tones and black truffles introduce the 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes, a textural and expansive wine that's medium to full-bodied wine, with an ample core of fruit, lively acids and a long, saline finish. Tasted after the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes, the more carnal Combottes represents a total change of register.",,RP 94
109,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a terrific success, offering up aromas of orange rind, red berries, spices and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and concentrated, with supremely velvety tannins, an ample core of fruit and a beautifully defined finish. Charming and succulent, this is a comparatively open, immediate rendition of Leroy's Corton-Renardes.",,RP 94
110,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Mingling deep fruit tones of raspberries and wild berries with exotic suggestions of Asian spices, rose hips and tea-smoked duck, Leroy's 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with powdery tannins, succulent acids and a deep, layered mid-palate. This, too, has turned out very well, though this year I'm inclined to prefer the Beaux Monts.",,RP 94
111,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is showing especially well this year, bursting with notes of raspberries, cherries, woodsmoke, grilled squab and rose petals. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with succulent acids, powdery tannins and an ample core of sapid fruit, concluding with a long and precise finish.",,RP 94
112,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Bursting with scents of rose petals, raspberries, cassis, spices and sweet soil tones, the 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes once again lives up to its name this year, its rounded and enveloping attack segueing into a medium to full-bodied palate that's supple and layered, its fine structuring tannins entirely cloaked in succulent, sapid fruit.",,RP 94
113,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is superb, and—as is often the case—I would argue that this is the finest of Domaine Leroy's communal bottlings this year. Opening in the glass with exquisite aromas of rose hips, raspberries, warm spices and sweet red fruits, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with racy acids and a long, mineral-driven finish.",,RP 94
114,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Aromas of cassis and plums mingle with notions of pencil lead, woodsmoke and rich soil tones, introducing the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu, a medium to full-bodied, velvety and succulent wine, with good depth at the core and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long finish. This is a comparatively giving, expressive rendition of Santenots, a cuvée that can often be a little introverted in its youth—indeed, I sometimes think it as the Clos Vougeot of the Côte de Beaune chez Leroy—though it still possesses plenty of upside.",,RP 94
115,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Exquisite aromas of wild berry fruit, smoked duck, exotic spices, peonies and loamy soil preface the 2017 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine with supple and powdery tannins, succulent balancing acids and a long, perfumed finish.",,RP 94
116,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berry fruit, spices and sweet soil tones that are discretely framed by a deft touch of new oak, Leroy's 2017 Pommard Les Vignots is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with powdery tannins, lively acids and good concentration at the core, concluding with a long and delicately carnal finish. This high-altitude, south-facing site always produces an ethereal, precise wine that's worlds away from Pommard's stereotype.",,RP 94
117,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Once again, Bize-Leroy opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges. The wine is showing well, opening up to reveal notes of cassis, grilled squab, rose hips and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, layered and attractively concentrated, energetic palate structured around fine and powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid.",,RP 94
118,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chambertin Grand Cru is a monument for the ages. Wafting from the glass with aromas of dark berries, orange rind, grilled meats, licorice and peony, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and immensely concentrated, with huge volume and amplitude, deep and multi-dimensional at the core, yet all the while remaining precise, vibrant and ineffably complete. Both the inevitable power and the essential elegance of Chambertin are fully realized in this timeless bottle. Whether this or the 2015 rendition is superior will be the subject for a debate that could last the better part of a century, yet the 2016's obvious stylistic affinity is with the 2010 vintage.",,RP 94
119,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"One of the high points of the vintage, the 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru captivates the olfactory senses with its striking bouquet of rose petals, citrus rind, cassis, raspberries, dark chocolate and sweet Asian spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, utterly complete and multidimensional, with satiny structuring tannins, immense concentration without the weight and a long, electric and perfumed finish. This is a magisterial achievement and a benchmark against which other wines may be measured.",,RP 94
120,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru is one of the more reticent wines in the cellar, reluctantly unfurling in the glass to reveal a profound bouquet of wild berries, rose petal, blood orange and ineffable savory nuances. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, incredibly deep and multidimensional, with extraordinary density without the weight and incredibly fine-grained tannins—but while this Musigny displays no structural asperity, so much is patently held in reserve that it's hard to read today. With bottle age, it's easy to imagine that this might end up being the finest of the Domaine Leroy's otherworldly 2016s, but over a decade's patience will be required.",,RP 94
121,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The extraordinary 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru soars from the glass with an irresistible bouquet of sweet dark fruits, baking chocolate, rose petals and exotic spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with incredible depth and volume at the core. Velvety and textural on the attack, the wine's powdery tannins are cloaked in a gourmand core of fruit, yet the lavish, expansive finish is beautifully controlled and precise for all its drama. Only in a range as exalted as this could Leroy's 2016 Richebourg receive so parsimonious a score.",,RP 94
122,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is brilliant, and one of the high points both of the portfolio and this great Côte de Nuits vintage. The wine unfurls in the glass with a captivating but youthfully reserved bouquet of rose petals, violets, blood orange, cherries and cassis, with only hints of the savory forest floor and spice to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and immensely concentrated, with an animating line of acidity that is classic Latricières, framed by exceptionally fine, powdery tannins, its finish long and unerringly precise.",,RP 94
123,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is one of the most exciting wines in the portfolio this year, unfurling in the glass with a beautifully defined bouquet of pomegranate, rose petal, raspberries, red plums and sweet spices, with only hints at the savory nuances to come. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and searingly intense, with a deep, layered mid-palate that's both more multidimensional and more structured than the Chambolle Fremières—a feat that had scarcely seemed possible. The finish is long, fine-grained and intensely chalky. In this frost-ravaged vintage, Bize-Leroy has produced a wine that tastes like the distilled essence of Chambolle Charmes.",,RP 94
124,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is just as stunning as the Brûlées, but more reserved and serious, unfurling in the glass with a less extravagant bouquet of cassis, plums, dark chocolate, grilled squab, subtle spices and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with striking amplitude and dimension, displaying a deep, searingly concentrated core that's framed by fine, powdery tannins. And if the Beaux Monts' finish isn't as expansive as the Brûlées', it's even longer and more penetrating. What's clear is that although the domaine's two Vosne premier crus touch, the wines themselves could hardly be more distinct.",,RP 94
125,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is striking, bursting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, grilled game, dark chocolate, cinnamon and violets. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and searingly concentrated, with a bottomless core of fruit, rich but supple structuring tannins, and a long, muscular finish. Above all, however, this wine is thrillingly vibrant, endowed with energy that evokes the 2010 rendition. It will need time, certainly, and it remains one of the more structural wines in the portfolio; but, if anything, it's less tight-knit than the 2015.",,RP 94
126,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru offers up a rich, brooding bouquet of cassis, wild berries, dark chocolate, incense and pencil shavings that are still quite youthfully reserved. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and layered, with immense concentration at the core, a rich chassis of structuring tannins and a long, powerful finish. Beautifully complete, this Clos Vougeot is predictably backward and tight-knit, and I suspect it will require more patience than any other wine in the cellar this year.",,RP 94
127,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a wine that speaks to the senses more than the intellect, soaring from the glass with aromas of ripe cassis, cherries and blackberries that mingle with lifted top-notes of rose petal and exotic spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and gourmand, cascading over the tongue with wave after wave of succulent, satiny fruit that entirely cloaks its satiny tannins, before concluding with a lavish, expansive but unerringly precise finish. I confess to a decided weakness for this Vosne-Romanée premier cru, a wine that's among the most viscerally thrilling in the Leroy portfolio.",,RP 94
128,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of citrus oil, beeswax, smoky pear, toasted nuts and an exotic top-note of candied angelica introduce the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, searingly concentrated wine that's structured around chewy dry extract more reminiscent of red wine, than white wine. Deep, concentrated and tight-knit, this is a stunning Corton-Charlemagne but it will require extended bottle age to attain its true plenitude of expression.",,RP 94
129,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"More reserved than the Vignerondes, the 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots unfurls in the glass with a brooding bouquet of wild berries, rich soil tones, Asian spices, dark chocolate and grilled game. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and broad, with considerable reserves of concentration and extract, framed by a large-scaled chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the long, stony finish.",,RP 94
130,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a particular success, unwinding with a captivating bouquet of rose petal, raspberries, orange rind and rich spices that are beautifully defined and multifaceted. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and fleshy, with satiny tannins that lend it a more than usually seductive aspect, though still underpinned by the bright line of acidity that always lend this wine is structure, concluding with a long and pure finish.",,RP 95
131,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is deep and brooding, unwinding in the glass with notes of wild blueberries, pencil lead, burning embers, cassis and grilled meat. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a broad-shouldered and firm but fine-grained chassis of structuring tannin fleshed out with deep reserves of fruit and savory nuance. The finish is long and sapid. As usual, this is one of the less immediate wines in the range and will need some time.",,RP 95
132,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is glorious, soaring from the glass in a blaze of red cherries, plums, rose petals and spices. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with incredible concentration without weight, rich but satiny structuring tannin and a long, vibrant finish.",,RP 95
133,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes bursts from the glass with expressive aromas of rose petals, berries and plums, complemented by savory hints of grilled meats. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and open-knit, with supple, fine-grained structuring tannins, a succulent core of fruit, and a long, expansive finish. This is an elegant and giving Combottes that's very true to type.",,RP 95
134,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"This year, Bize-Leroy once again opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the wine is incredible, unfurling in the glass with aromas of dark berries, pencil lead, dried flowers, rose hip and rich soil tones. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, immensely concentrated and intense, with a deep, multidimensional core, vibrant acids and a long, resonant finish.",,RP 95
135,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"There are two barrels of the other-worldly 2016 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a wine that wafts from the glass with a stunning bouquet of raspberries, plums, smoked duck, spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, velvety and layered, with stunning concentration, powdery tannins and a long, pungently perfumed finish. It's a village wine that surpasses plenty of lesser producers' grands crus.",,RP 95
136,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Bursting from the glass with an arresting bouquet of rose petals, raspberries, dried flowers and dark chocolate, the 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is medium to full-bodied, satiny and immensely concentrated, its fine tannins are entirely hidden in a deep core of fruit, its finish long, pure and unmistakably mineral. It's quintessentially Chambolle, but this singular vintage is unusually intense, even by Leroy's standards.",,RP 95
137,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes offers up aromas of wild berries, spices, dried flowers and sweet soil tones, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional palate, its delicately chalky tannins cloaked in a fleshy core of fruit that lives up to the climat's name, concluding with a long and perfumed finish.",,RP 95
138,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"Aromas of spicy wild berries, grilled meat and forest floor introduce the superb 2016 Pommard Les Vignots, a medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated wine with a deep, tight-knit core, powerful structuring tannins and a lovely line of animating acidity. More reserved than the gourmand 2015 rendition, this will be less approachable out of the gates and is more obviously defined by its high-altitude site.",,RP 95
139,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2010 Chambertin Grand Cru is spectacular, bursting from the glass with a youthful bouquet of rich red and black fruits, burning embers, rose petal and licorice, subtly framed by a discreet application of new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with satiny tannins, a concentrated core of fruit and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Of all Leroy's 2010s, this demands the most additional cellaring, and I suspect it will also prove to be the longest lived. This monumental wine is a reminder that Chambertin is not the greatest of the commune's grands crus by virtue of its power but rather thanks to its ineffable completeness and elegance.",,RP 95
140,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2010 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is spectacular, unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of wild red berries, potpourri, smoked duck and exotic spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with utterly suave structuring tannins and a superb line of acidity that lends the wine immense length and focus—in contrast to the broader, more expansive and gourmand Richebourg served alongside it. This is a real highlight of the 2010 portfolio and I suspect it is holding a great deal in reserve to be revealed over the coming decade and beyond.",,RP 95
141,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Notes of lemon oil, nutmeg and sesame mingle with lime zest and white truffle in a complex mélange, introducing the 2010 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firmly structured, with immense concentration, tension and substance. Like the whites from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it, this Corton-Charlemagne exhibits a phenolic frame that wouldn't be out of place in a red wine, and it requires the best part of another decade of cellaring.",,RP 95
142,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Notes of smoked duck, rich black fruits and Asian spices introduce the 2010 Richebourg Grand Cru, an ample, full-bodied wine with a gourmand core of fruit that largely conceals its satiny tannins, underpinned by tangy balancing acids. The finish is long and sapid. The Richebourg is more dramatic and expansive than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, but it isn't quite as focused and elegant.",,RP 95
143,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2010 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is already comparatively expressive today, wafting from the glass with aromas of red berries, cassis, incense and musk, with bass notes of sweet grilled meat emerging with time in the glass. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and bright, built around a beautiful line of racy acidity and framed by fine-grained, delicately chalky tannins. It's very intense and long.",,RP 95
144,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is very special, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of raw cocoa, Asian spices, ripe plums, rose petal and potpourri. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and perfumed, with a gourmand, layered mid-palate, melting tannins and a long, beautifully delineated finish. In recent vintages, I've tended to prefer the Domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant to its Richebourg, but in 1999 it's the latter that has the edge.",,RP 95
145,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 1999 Chambertin Grand Cru is a rich, dramatic wine, bursting with aromas of sweet cassis, rich soil, cedary new oak and incense. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and textural, with a firm chassis of structuring tannins and a long, stony finish. This Chambertin isn't as seamless or weightlessly intense as more recent vintages from Domaine Leroy, but it's a very exciting wine.",,RP 95
146,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"A rich, dramatic wine, the 1999 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru bursts with aromas of caramelized citrus, pear, verbena flowers and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and powerful, with chewy extract and structure, displaying immense concentration and stony depth. It's still shockingly youthful, so I may be underestimating it, but I didn't find it quite as complete or profound as the two 1999s from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it.",,RP 95
147,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 1999 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru was the one wine in the range that seemed a little fatigued, offering up aromas of dried red berries, candied peel, sweet spices and camphor, with a light framing of new oak still in evidence. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, firm and chalky, without the multidimensional completeness and seamless integration that the domaine so routinely attains.",,RP 95
148,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is one of the most magical wines to be found in Burgundy in this vintage, soaring from the glass with a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, featuring notes of rose petal, blood orange, potpourri and bright berry fruit, with only hints of the savory complexity to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is deep, full-bodied and extraordinarily multifaceted, with immense concentration, incredible energy and a long, resonating finish. Both more elegant and more reserved than the gloriously dramatic Richebourg that followed it, this is a profound Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",,RP 95
149,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Chambertin Grand Cru soars from the glass with a profound bouquet of cassis, cherry, raspberry, rose hip, grilled meat, spice and cedar. On the palate, the full extent of this wine's stunning amplitude and depth—and the reserves of energy that lie behind them—defy description. That a wine of such scale and concentration should be so seamless and complete is hard to fathom. The ecstatic commentary scribbled in my notebook concludes with the phrase ""essence of wine.""",,RP 95
150,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"The utterly profound 2015 Musigny Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy, the crowning achievement to an extraordinary portfolio and a wine that brought tears to my eyes, wafts from the glass with a deep bouquet of black raspberry, cherry, rose petal and spice. On the palate, the wine is bottomless and multidimensional, with satiny tannins and fruit of crystalline purity, so utterly harmonious and structurally complete as to border on the ineffable—and certainly to exhaust any tired superlatives. The finish is incredibly penetrating and persistent.",,RP 95
151,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is an extraordinary wine that captures all the lavishness and power of this great grand cru, soaring from the glass with a deep bouquet of ripe black fruits, exotic spice, licorice and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is huge and multidimensional, with extraordinary concentration and mid-palate depth, vibrant and full of energy despite its imposing scale. Such is the intensity of its finish that neither swallowing nor expectoration have any immediate impact: it's as if the wine's still there. While this will never have the complexity or elegance of the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, it represents the essence of Richebourg.",,RP 95
152,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is one of the highlights in Domaine Leroy's formidable portfolio, soaring from the glass with an extroverted but almost ineffably complex bouquet of ripe blackberry, peony, game bird and wood smoke. On the palate, the wine is extraordinarily velvety and grand, with a lavish attack, a layered and multidimensional mid-palate and a long, saline finish—scintillatingly energetic despite the ripe, dramatic profile so typical of this climat. If there were ever any doubts about whether Aux Brûlées is one of Vosne-Romanée's finest premier crus, this bottle will dispel them. For now, the wine hasn't shut down, and I expect it to offer a very broad drinking window.",,RP 95
153,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is spectacular, wafting from the glass with notes of rose petal, black cherry, cassis, rich spices and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is silky, elegant and multidimensional—a world away from the assertive structure of its near-neighbor Clos de la Roche—with silky tannins, superb concentration and a vibrant, saline finish. For all its intensity of flavor, this Latricières is a delicate, transparent wine that fully realizes this grand cru's potential.",,RP 95
154,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a wine for the ages, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of incense, smoky black fruits, red cherry and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firm at the core, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins, excellent concentration and a firm, structural finish. Of all the Domaine Leroy 2015s, this—along with the Clos de la Roche—will demand the most extended cellaring.",,RP 95
155,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Like the Clos de Vougeot, the 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is built for the ages, opening in the glass with a bouquet of red-black berries, cherries, wood smoke, pencil shavings and incipient suggestions of soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and firm, with an ample and assertive chassis of chalky tannins, formidable power and concentration, with a long, grippy finish. This is cut from very different cloth than the Musigny that preceded it in our tasting, but it is taut rather than hard: the only missing ingredient is time.",,RP 95
156,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is spellbindingly wonderful, wafting from the glass with notes of cherry, raspberry, red plum, peony, lapsang tea and sweet spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and effortlessly complete, with incredible perfume, superb concentration and incredible length on the saline, penetrating finish. Of all Leroy's premier crus, this wine is the hardest to describe, since it's defined above all by its grace and harmony.",,RP 95
157,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots from Lalou Bize-Leroy is an extraordinary rendition of this great vineyard, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of sweet spices, dark fruit—plum, cherry—and rose petal that's both more exotic and less savory than this year's Vignerondes. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with grand cru depth and dimension, its authoritative chassis of fine-grained tannin only asserting itself on the firm, saline finish. In contrast to the giving Vignerondes, this Boudots is decidedly more brooding and structurally reserved, and it will need a decade in the cellar and benefit from longer.",,RP 95
158,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes offers up a deep-pitched bouquet of wild berries, spice, orange peel and grilled meat. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and multidimensional, with a fine-grained chassis of tannin that's more assertive than the structuring elements of the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes or the Vosne Aux Brulées and which nods to the authority of Clos de la Roche in its profile. The finish is long, ripe and sapid.",,RP 95
159,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy offers up a pretty nose of red cherry, raspberry, lapsang tea and rose hip, with none of the more feral aromas that sometimes seem to earn this climat its soubriquet. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and concentrated, built around a chalky chassis of tannin and a bright, vertical line of acidity. This will need some time in the cellar, but it should emerge as a beautifully elegant example of Corton.",,RP 95
160,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy opens in the glass with a bright bouquet of apple, lemon oil, wheat toast and smoke, framed by light reduction. On the palate, the wine is incredibly concentrated and intense, with a formidable structure and chalky extract that would be more familiar in a red wine and has a long, intense, almost searing finish. This was cropped at a mere 15 hectoliters per hectare, but while Chardonnay at yields like this can become overbearing, this Corton-Charlemagne—even in this sunny vintage—avoids any excess of weight or any trace of corpulence. It's built for the long haul.",,RP 95
161,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons bursts from the glass with a deep bouquet of plums, red berries, grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is broad and velvety, its tannins entirely hidden in a sapid core of fruit, its underpinning acids bright and vibrant and its finish long. This Savigny's structural finesse is as striking as its marriage of bright fruit with kaleidoscopic savory nuance.",,RP 95
162,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu from Domaine Leroy is one of the more brooding, reserved wines in the portfolio this year, opening in the glass with notes of plums, inky dark berries and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and powerful, with immense concentration and a velvety but firm chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the chalky, authoritative finish. This will take time to realize all its potential, but at maturity this score is likely to look conservative.",,RP 95
163,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes from Domaine Leroy is a wonderful wine, offering up an expressive bouquet of cassis, game bird, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is more structurally giving than the Boudots from further north along the slope, with silky tannins, a deep core of concentrated fruit and an incredibly long, saline finish. This was cropped at a mere 13.95 hectoliters per hectare, but—as with all the Domaine Leroy wines—that translates into intensity but never heaviness.",,RP 95
164,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2015 Pommard Les Vignots is fabulous, soaring from the glass with a complex bouquet of peony, sweet plum, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a deep core of crunchy fruit, racy acids and a wonderful sense of completeness. In Leroy's hands, this cool lieu-dit high on the slope above the village of Pommard has really excelled in this vintage.",,RP 95
165,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"The 2008 Nuits-Saint-Georges Villages from Domaine Leroy is beginning to drink very well, bursting from the glass with a complex bouquet of cinnamon, blood orange, peony, cassis, blackberry and raw cocoa. On the palate, the wine is sappy, expansive and medium-full, with an ample mid-palate, fine-grained tannins and a penetrating, saline finish—weightless but intense. In this vintage Bize-Leroy opted to combine the Nuits lieux-dits that she usually bottles separately: Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières.",,RP 95
166,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 1999 Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Allots from Leroy was still very powerful on the nose with ""thickset"" red berry fruit, a hint of blue fruit and a struck match scent that did not quite fit in. The palate is again powerful and dense, in my opinion my reflective of the 1999 growing season rather than the terroir, a village cru straining to flex its muscles and be treated as a premier cru. You admire that ambition, and yet it never quite achieves the nuance and complexity on the finish that would convince you of that. It is undeniably a delicious Aux Allots but one that did not trigger an intellectual or emotional response. Tasted January 2017.",,RP 95
167,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1988 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy was, of course, the debut vintage released under Lalou Bize-Leroy's name. Now at 28 years of age, it is probably beginning its descent from its peak in the 1990s although it continues to give drinking pleasure. Deep in color for the vintage, it offers pleasant cranberry, undergrowth, crushed violet petal and clove aromas that feel a little ""dimmed"" by the passing years. The palate is a little chunky compared to more recent vintages that I have tasted, quite tart in the mouth and conveying an almost Bordeaux-like structure on the finish that now feels a little short. Any bottles should be consumed in the near future because it is in gentle decline, albeit from a high peak. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 95
168,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"It has been almost 15 years since I last tasted the 1989 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts. This was an impressive showing for a 27-year-old wine that comes from one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's earliest vintages of her domaine. It has a beautiful pixelated bouquet with strawberry preserve, sous-bois, morels and autumn leaves. This is sleek and sensual. The palate is medium-bodied with pitch-perfect acidity, still surprisingly youthful, long and quite plush in the mouth with plenty of vigour on the refined finish. It appears to be maturing at a glacial pace. This is a supremely well-crafted wine from what was a hit and miss Burgundy vintage. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 95
169,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2002 Richebourg Grand Cru must surely be Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest wine of the vintage. It has more class than the 2002 Latricières-Chambertin--pure wild strawberry and black truffle on the nose that gathers momentum with each ticking hand of the clock as if to say: ""You want more?"" Of course you do. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin. There is great depth here as one expects from a Richebourg, not a powerful grand cru because this vintage was all about the nuance and delicacy, but it fans out wondrously on the finish with crushed strawberry and hints of cured meats. Very long, very elegant, very Leroy. This is an absolute treat. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
170,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2002 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts displayed a tensile, energetic bouquet that appeared to possess more focus than a 1989 Beaux Monts from Lalou that I had tasted a few days earlier. The aromatics are heavenly--mulberry, maraschino cherry, tobacco and a hint of seaweed, all beautifully defined and still surprisingly youthful. The palate is sensual, refined and backward. There is real vibrancy to this Beaux Monts, notes of raspberry coulis, red cherries and a touch of cola. It gently fans out on the finish, caressing in texture, refined and pure. I wonder whether this will actually improve with further bottle age? I suspect it has reached its plateau, but will continue giving drinking pleasure for many years.",,RP 95
171,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2002 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is a very fine contribution to the vintage courtesy of Lalou Bize-Leroy. It has a tensile bouquet with edgy black cherry, dark chocolate and undergrowth notes, holding something back at first but then getting into its stride with a few minutes in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly brittle tannin (something that I occasionally find in this grand cru.) Yes, it is a touch foursquare, ""correct"" compared the more sensual 2002 Vosne Beaux Monts, but the energy and focus win you over. Drink now, but don't be afraid to cellar this for another 15 to 20 years. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
172,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2002 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes has a lucid color. The nose sprints from the blocks with lively bing cherry, mulberry and black truffle scents, perhaps a little more loose-knit than I expected yet still exuding charm. The palate is very well balanced, quite evolved compared to Lalou Bize-Leroy's other 2002s with a gravel-tinged, slightly ferrous nose . While it does not possess the complexity of its peers, this is simply a delicious, warm-hearted Chambolle-Musigny to drink now and over the next 5-10 years. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
173,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1997 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Leroy is a decent white Burgundy, but its intrinsic quality did not size up to its reputation on this occasion. The nose is slightly reduced, but felt a little straightforward with citrus lemon and flinty aromas. It was just missing a little ""fatness"" you seek from this grand cru. The palate is balanced with a keen line of acidity, though it never soars, remaining a little broody and sultry. It opens with time in the glass, but I noticed a touch of warmth on the back of the throat and so I would drink this in the near future. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
174,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru is more backward than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment (the opposite to Hudelot-Noëllat the previous day when it was the other way round). Here, there is a very subtle marine/seaweed influence that tinctures that dark berry fruit. The palate is defined by its very fine tannin, the focus and tension interwoven through every atom of this Richebourg; the finish is surfeit with nervosité and tension so that is slips down the throat (guilty!) with so much ease. Wonderful -- one of the wines of the vintage.",,RP 95
175,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée St Vivant Grand Cru has a pure bouquet as you would expect, an equal mixture of red and black fruit, but infused with cold stone, wet limestone scents. This is beautifully focused. The palate is very well balanced with superb density, almost Richebourg-like in style, here veering towards dark red fruit -- cranberry, wild strawberry and a touch of brown spice towards the supremely focused and long finish. Sophisticated and precise, this is a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will rivet you to your seat.",,RP 95
176,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"Unlike last year, there are three barrels of the 2014 Musigny Grand Cru this year instead of two, not that it is going to make it any easier to find and somehow, I'm not expecting a massive reduction in price. It has a very complex bouquet with dark red fruit, limestone, a hint of hickory and wild hedgerow, quite mercurial in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, silkier than the Clos de Vougeot, harmonious with a killer thread of spice that bursts out towards the finish. Very complex and sophisticated, this Musigny deserves several years in bottle before even thinking about it.",,RP 95
177,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has just a faint reduction on the nose, but behind that lies very intense dark cherry, cranberry jus and mineral scents that seem to gain intensity with every swirl of the glass. The palate is stunning: filigree tannin, almost overwhelming intensity with great power and detail on the silky-smooth finish. This could turn out to be one of the domaine's finest 2014s given this showing, certainly one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest premier crus.",,RP 95
178,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a focused, slightly more introspective bouquet at the moment: dark red fruit, a little briary and cold stone scents. The palate is where it is all happening...filigree tannin, tensile and full of nervosité, unapologetically linear and focused, a Gevrey that demands to be taken seriously with an intense, slightly saline, wonderfully detailed finish that lingers long in the mouth. Superb.",,RP 95
179,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Grand Cru has a backward nose, much more so than the Latricières at the moment, though one can tell that is very well defined and full of tension. The palate is structured right from the entry, arching tannins here, beautifully focused with perfect acidity, gently flowing towards a very poised and tender finish that has so much tension. This is a regal Chambertin.",,RP 95
180,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Boudots 1er Cru has an open, complex nose, here a melange of red and black fruit infused with cold stone, almost flinty scents that impart great focus into this premier cru. The palate is extremely focused, symmetrical, with superb salinity and tension on the finish that lingers for a long time in the mouth. Deep and serious, this is a quite enthralling Nuits-Saint-Georges.",,RP (93-95)
181,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was showing a little more reduction than the other Grand Crus this year, the shopfront closed. The palate is more expressive with supple tannin, a touch of white pepper on the entry, very cohesive but linear for a Clos de la Roche that keeps a tight control on the finish. But the aftertaste is extraordinarily long, leaving the mouth tingling a minute after the wine has departed. One comes away with the impression that this is keeping something up its sleeve after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
182,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes was showing just a little reduction, but behind lies voluminous mulberry and blackcurrant fruit, here edging more towards the dark side of the fruit spectrum. The palate is quite dense, full in the mouth with a gentle grip, some salinity towards the finish, although it is yet to discover is ""flow"" on the finish that at the moment just feels a little static. That will develop once it is in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
183,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny les Fremières 1er Cru has a conservative nose, one that does not want to come out to play at first, although it gradually unfurls in the glass. The palate is very smooth and silky, almost like a Vosne-Romanée, furnished with fine tannin and a keen acidic thread interwoven through what feels like a dense finish. It is linear at the moment, but it will fan out once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
184,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Renardes Grand Cru already has an intriguing bouquet that is forming in barrel, a little more open at the moment with dark berry fruit, a touch of Earl Grey and bay leaf. It is nicely defined, somehow effortless. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, nice and saline in the mouth, very harmonious and silky smooth, so much so that you might think this was Côtes de Nuits. Lovely.",,RP (93-95)
185,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Latricières Chambertin Grand Cru was more open and transparent than the other grand crus this year, with black fruit more than red, a touch of earthiness and a hint of wild mushroom. The palate is quite saline on the entry, typically rather foursquare and correct, the acidity extremely well judged with a controlled -- you could almost say -- conservative finish.",,RP (93-95)
186,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Aux Allots has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath lie some fine, clean and pure black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. There is plenty of energy and animation here, an almost sorbet-like freshness, slightly candied towards the bright and lucid finish. Among Lalou Bize-Leroy's village cru, this might actually be my pick.",,RP (93-95)
187,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is packed full of dark red berry fruit on the nose, just a hint of bay leaf and Earl Grey tea in the background. It is very precise. The palate is fresh and crisp, founded upon edgy tannin, very tensile and brooding especially on the finish that clams up a little, finished in tight-lipped and taciturn fashion.",,RP (93-95)
188,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Aux Genaivrières was a wine that was showing some reduction on the nose, but some rigorous exchange from glass to glass reveals some gorgeous, ebullient raspberry coulis and blueberry scents. The palate is structured and ""solid"" in the mouth, quite dense for a village cru, with plenty of substance on the mulberry and strawberry finish. Give it longer than necessary once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
189,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Vignerondes 1er Cru was a little reduced on the nose, but the palate is very promising with bright red cherry and strawberry fruit, as well as a keen line of acidity. This is a more feminine 2014 with a finessed, beautifully poised finish. Maybe earlier drinking than its peers, yet there is palpable energy here that should see it age for 10 or more years.",,RP (93-95)
190,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru had the unenviable task of following the spellbinding Richebourg and I feel that it does not quite deliver the same degree of complexity and profundity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, just a touch of meatiness on the more savory finish that is long and tender. Fine, if not quite at the level of Lalou's other grand crus this year.",,RP (93-95)
191,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu has a perfumed and quite floral bouquet with pressed rose petal infusing the red berry fruit. It is tight at the moment and will need several years once in bottle. The palate is well balanced, some hardness on the mid-palate, masculine and rigid at the moment, and yet to develop the roundness of this vineyard. But clearly very focused and perhaps a Volnay for the long term.",,RP (93-95)
192,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"When broaching the 2014 Savigny lès Beaune les Narbantons, Lalou quipped that it was her ""Petit Corton."" It has a complex nose of red berry fruit, dried orange peel and even a distant scent of fresh fig. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, plenty of freshness and vitality here, a little hardness toward the finish and a light spicy aftertaste. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
193,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Lavieres has bright raspberry and cranberry fruit on the nose, more stoniness coming through compared to the Aux Allots. The palate is very refined, supple in the mouth, fleshing out nicely towards the finish with hints of brown spice and tart red cherries lining the appealing finish. Just lovely.",,RP (93-95)
194,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Au Bas de Combe, of which there are just two barrels this year, had a  reduced nose when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is lined with darker red fruit than the Lavières, nicely structured, perhaps more masculine, more rustic in style but with plenty of substance. Give it 2-3 years at least after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
195,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2014 Pommard les Vignots has a very elegant bouquet, very pure and self-contained with bright red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and acidity, red cherry and a touch of spice on the structured, slightly brittle finish. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
196,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Romanée-Saint-Vivant 1996 from Domaine Leroy was actually a last minute substitute donated by a generous guest following a string of corked wines. It is an absolutely stunning wine that transfixed everyone before we knew its identity (and here, I must confess that I suggested it was Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.) It's actually better than that. It has a heavenly bouquet  of black cherries, cold limestone and wilted flower petals that you could just sit back and inhale all day. The palate is exquisitely balanced with filigree tannin, extremely pure and refined with astonishing tension and precision from start to finish. It's the vinous equivalent of watching ""Swan Lake.""",,RP (93-95)
197,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a more floral bouquet compared to the Romanee Saint Vivant, at least at the moment. It is very complex: black fruit rather than red, with hints of wilted violet petals and damp moss aromas developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with enormous structure and dimension. It is extremely complex, to the point where I found it difficult to find the right words! It just has a sense of authority and an incredible length that gently grips the mouth and stays there for two minutes after this ineffable wine has departed. Magnificent.",,RP (93-95)
198,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"It seems banal to state that the 2013 Musigny Grand Cru has a very “Musigny” like nose, but that is to say it articulates the terroir extremely well on the nose with black plum and boysenberry fruit, minerals, hints of truffle just in the background. The palate is very refined and pure, lithe, with filigree tannins and persuasive blackberry and bilberry fruit toward the finish inflected with hints of juniper and thyme. This is a Musigny that forces you to pause and reflect.",,RP (93-95)
199,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru has a more expressive bouquet vis-a-vis when I tasted the 2012 last year. Here, one finds touches of maraschino cherries, wild strawberry and undergrowth all beautifully defined, vivacious and ebullient. The palate is supremely focused and symmetrical, the tannin lacy and the texture so silky you might well mistake it for, say, a Romanee Saint Vivant. This is one of the finest Latricieres-Chambertins that I have tasted from Leroy.",,RP (93-95)
200,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant has enthralling transparency and clarity on the nose with perfumed black cherry, bilberry and cold stone scents, perhaps almost like Richebourg in style! The palate is medium-bodied with saturated, silky smooth tannins, luscious red cherry and pomegranate fruit with great purity on the long and tender finish. This is very tempting and sensual. Put a padlock and key on this for several years.",,RP (93-95)
201,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"After the outstanding Latricieres-Chambertin ’13, the 2013 Chambertin appeared sultrier and introspective, difficult to read at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, perhaps more backbone than the Latricieres but at the same time, its seriousness is quite arresting after the flamboyance of its “sister” Grand Cru. It is a Chambertin that does not quite want to get to know you at this absurdly premature juncture and it will require 8-10 years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
202,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de la Roche has an airy and transparent nose that prioritizes the mineral-nature of the vineyard over the fruit at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, lithe in the mouth rather than fleshy, with very good weight, linear, but very harmonious and tender. This is a more understated Clos de la Roche in 2013, nevertheless a beautiful wine that I suspect might drink earlier than the other Grand Crus and yet will last just as long. ",,RP (93-95)
203,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has great clarity on the nose, here veering more toward red fruit than the les Brulées, with subtle wet limestone and granitic scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied, very “gourmand” in the mouth, the kind of wine you don’t know whether to drink or eat (not in terms of texture but the flavors). There is a lovely meaty note that surfaces on the long finish. Tres bon vin!",,RP (93-95)
204,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a very complex bouquet with scents of wet limestone and sea spray infusing the red and black fruit. This is almost pixilated. The palate is quite masculine and linear at the moment, very well defined, impressive structure and presence with a very persistent finish that stays in the mouth a minute after the wine has departed. Divine.",,RP (93-95)
205,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Brulées has a very intense bouquet, a little more floral than I was anticipating, with wilted violets scents chaperoning the black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate is linear and poised, with tensile tannin: strict at first, but that latent concentration fans out gloriously on the tender finish that belies the structure. Sublime.",,RP (93-95)
206,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Hail damage means that there is only a single barrel of the 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu possesses a very elegant wild strawberry and mineral-scented bouquet that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, strawberry pastille and subtle cassis notes towards the suave finish.",,RP (93-95)
207,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Au Bas de Combe veers toward more red fruit than black, compared to the NSG Les Lavieres. The palate is very poised and surfeit with minerality. I detected a little more brightness and verve compared to the Les Lavieres with a prickle of white pepper toward the composed finish.",,RP (93-95)
208,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes seemed more closed, broodier on the nose, compared to the other 2013s from Lalou at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied, fleshy and tender in the mouth, the red fruit moving to black toward the finish furnished with white pepper, rosemary and spice. Quite a mercurial Chambolle, I would afford this at least five or six years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
209,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"There is something slightly more ""confit"" on the nose of the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Les Lavieres compared to the Aux Allot. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine minerality and precision, structured and aloof on the end but extremely well focused. Give this 2 or 3 years after bottling.",,RP (93-95)
210,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Fremieres has a pastille-like purity on the nose adorned with perfumed strawberry and Morello scents, hints of rose petal just behind. The palate is medium-bodied, quite masculine and reserved at first, tertiary/forest floor notes towards the elegant, “classic” Chambolle finish.",,RP (93-95)
211,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges les Vignerondes has a rounded and even at this early stage, generous bouquet with dark plum and mulberry scents, wild hedgerow and a touch of mushroom. The palate is soft on the entry, plenty of ""rondeur"" here with a sensual, caressing dark plum and wild strawberry finish that lingers long in the mouth. This will be very tempting in its youth.",,RP (93-95)
212,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée les Genevrieres has a broody, introspective, sea spray-tinged bouquet that opens beautifully in the glass, but there is something saturnine here, aromatics indifferent to getting to know you. The palate is medium-bodied with a ""confit"" entry, gently grippy tannin structure and an effortless mineral-rich finish, if not quite the length of a top vintage.",,RP (93-95)
213,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is more subdued on the nose compared to Lalou's other '13s, at least on the morning that I tasted it from barrel. It just feels a little conservative. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly angular tannins yet plenty of freshness with a likeable red cherry and cassis-tinged finish that feels silky in the mouth, albeit without the persistence of a great vintage.",,RP (93-95)
214,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"There are just two barrels of the 2013 Savigny-les-Beaunes les Narbantons this year, instead of the usual six. It has a very expressive bouquet with light rose petal and forest-floor notes infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins: crisp acidity and an enthralling brightness toward the finish. This is the kind of Savigny you would slug back with abandon (if you had not seen the producer’s name.)",,RP (93-95)
215,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Aux Allots has a taut, reserved and quite tertiary bouquet that takes time to unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannins, a little savory in the mouth with a harmonious, spicy finish. This constitutes one of Lalou's more approachable earlier-drinking 2013s.",,RP (93-95)
216,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"There was just a little hail damage that affected the 2013 Pommard les Vignots this year. It has a light blackcurrant and briary-scented bouquet that needs a little more vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannins. It feels quite masculine in the mouth, perhaps more austere than the 2012 although the smudge of iodine is welcome.",,RP (93-95)
217,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"No, not the cheapest wine on the planet, but probably worth it. This 1998 Vosne Romanee les Beaux-Monts has a fabulous bouquet with wonderful delineation, hints of bay leaf and rose-petals infusing the mulberry and wild strawberry fruit, developing a fabulous ferrous note with aeration. The palate is fresh and wonderfully poised, the acidity perfectly judged, utterly harmonious with a cashmere texture from start to finish. There is a slight hickory note developing and enhancing the finish that is amazingly detailed, concluding what must be one of the most divine 1998 Côte de Nuits wines at the moment.",,RP (93-95)
218,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the otherworldly 2012 Musigny Grand Cru this year. Despite just a hint of reduction, the intensity on this grand cru is palpable and it unfurls in the moments it has in the glass, revealing dark plum and truffle scents that infuse the black and red fruit. The palate is defies all expectations: perfect acidity, utterly refined tannins, silky texture, a sense of harmony and completeness that it seems to stop the world. To put it candidly, this is a contender for one of the greatest wines that I have ever tasted from barrel…and I have tasted quite a few. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

219,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru was showing more reduction than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant at time of tasting and so I allowed longer for the wine just to try and shake off a little free sulfur. There is wonderful mineralite here – supreme delineation but it is tightly wound, more laconic than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant. The palate is symmetrical, refined and yet intense with life-affirming mineralite on the haunting finish. There is perhaps just a little more persistency than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant, a touch more masculinity also. Wonderful.

220,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru has an entrancing, extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve and wild strawberry intermingling with minerals, cold stone. The palate is so refined and effortless: filigree tannins, perfect acidity allied with a sense of effortlessness contrary to the effort that went into its creation. So silky and weightless on the cashmere finish, this is a wine that you will tell your children about if you are ever blessed to drink a bottle.

221,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"To be honest, the 2012 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has an unenviable job following the transcendental Musigny, but it is still a gorgeous wine, offering incense and blackcurrants infused with minerals on the nose. The palate is structured with a slightly chalky texture, adorned with a lovely sour lemon note that counterbalanced with broody black fruit that builds in the mouth to a very focused, linear finish. Sheer class.

222,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chambertin Grand Cru already boasts a sophisticated bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit, broody at first but opening with a few swirls of the glass. There are hints of maraschino cherry emerging, light touches of mulberry and pomegranate. The palate is medium-bodied with a sterner character than the Latricieres. This is an aristocratic Chambertin in the making, serious and obdurate, underpinned by firm tannins that support the intense, broody black fruit. It has wonderful persistency in the mouth, allied with freshness and race. As epic as Arcade Fire’s “Reflektor”!

223,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"There is just a single barrel of the 2012 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes that was perched at the end of the row in Lalou’s cellar. It is adorned with a very intense bouquet with dark plum, wild strawberry and forest floor scents, the mineralite emerging with time. The palate has exquisite delineation – it seems to just glide across the mouth, with energetic sorbet-fresh red fruit laced with blood orange and spice, the finish offering hints of cumin and black pepper. This is very complex, intellectual Combottes for long-term aging.

Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

226,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the 2012 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru. It has a fragrant, floral bouquet that like so many of Lalou’s 2012s is exquisitely defined and intense, yet never over-powering. The palate is understated, nonchalant even, with perfect acidity and abundant sappy black fruit beautifully interwoven with the oak, segueing into quite a weighty, yet elegant finish. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations.

227,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"There are three pieces of the 2012 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru this year, the solitary white wine from the domaine. It needed two or three minutes to shake off some sulfur. Underneath one can find intense phenolic aromas, pithy pear, nectarine and honeysuckle aromas that are just a little muffled at the moment. The palate is fresh and refined on the entry with apricot and white peach notes, hints of shaved ginger and a light, beautifully balanced finish that seems as fresh as a daisy. Lovely.

228,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots needed a little more coaxing than les Vignerondes, but unfurls to reveal dried petals scents suffusing the red and black fruit profile. The palate is cut from the same cloth as les Vignerondes, but displays a little more matiere and even more precision towards the piercing finish, decorated with hints of wild mushroom towards the long and tender aftertaste. Gorgeous.

229,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru is more open on the nose compared to Lalou’s other grand crus with plenty of rich, generous blackberry and mulberry fruit with hints of wild mushroom just lurking underneath. The palate is lively and precise on the entry. The acidity is very keen here; lending nervosite and freshness, informing the tense citrus-fresh finish that is more like a Vosne-Romanee! This is entrancing and in my opinion it is better than the 2011.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine, succulent tannins offset by a silver thread of acidity. This contains wonderful focus and precision with enthralling nervosite and focus on the shimmering finish.

It has a broody raspberry and wild strawberry-scented bouquet infused with touches of undergrowth and forest floor. The palate is where it is all happening at this prenatal stage: “killer” tannins, nigh on perfect acidity and a sense of purity that is already quite enthralling. It will need several years once in bottle, but this has enormous potential.

Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

239,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanee-St-Vivant Grand Cru is blessed with a quintessential, floral bouquet that has beguiling complexity. Just allowing it to open over two or three minutes reveals hidden facets: limestone cave, dried herbs, jasmine tea and bay leaf that are all exquisitely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine grip on the entry. There is plenty of concentration here, but it is brilliantly channeled and the finish fans out gloriously on the spice-tinged, animated finish. This is a sensational wine. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

240,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Chambertin Grand Cru demonstrates more complexity and nuance than the Latricieres. The minerality here is immediately evident and the oak seamlessly integrated. The palate is very well-defined with fine tannins, some unresolved oak here to be subsumed, but very focused and intense toward the finish. There is a sense of confidence and brio here that was missing in the Latricieres. What a fabulous wine.

241,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Lavieres has a nose born of the sky more than the earth: airy, lifted and feminine. Touches of cold limestone emerge with time that are entrancing. The palate is vibrant and vital on the entry with a silver thread of acidity, a gradual build in the mouth with shimmering dark cherry and bergamot, then a gentle grip on the tense and teasing Vosne-like finish. Superb.

242,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"The rara avis that is the 2011 Musigny Grand Cru has a haunting bouquet that, once again, deserves time to unfurl with blackberry, pomegranate, mineral, cedar and oyster shell notes that are exquisitely defined. The palate is underpinned by filigree tannins. It feels so lithe in the mouth, spicy right from the start that sets the mouth tingling and then a crescendo toward the dark plum and bergamot-tinged finish. This is very complex and simply seamless in the mouth.

243,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Brulee has another striking bouquet, quintessential Vosne-like breeding and sophistication with very pure, mineral-rich red and black fruit marrying beautifully together. It gains intensity in just two or three minutes. The palate is vibrant and quite spicy, almost exotic in terms of richness on the entry, perhaps one of Lalou’s more extravagant 2011s with a scintillating, silky smooth finish that fans across the mouth with hints of raspberry and pomegranate. There is enormous length and intensity present here – a superb Pinot Noir brimming over with vivacity and charm. The parcel of vines within Les Beaux Monts is basically a continuation of Aux Brulees.

The palate is structured with firm tannins, foursquare at first but fanning out wonderfully on the second half. There is a gentle grip here with layers of pure black fruit laced with minerals and an extraordinarily long aftertaste.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins, a denser framework than the RSV with a powerful, almost burly finish, though perhaps the Romanee-Sain-Vivant has a little more finesse and tension.

The 2011 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru has a bewitching floral bouquet, perhaps not quite as complex as the Clos de la Roche but beautifully defined, perhaps haunting being the most appropriate word. The palate leans more toward a red fruit profile with succulent ripe tannins; gentle grip and a multi-layered, white pepper-tinged finish that revivifies the senses, leaving it tingling long after the wine has departed.

The palate is medium-bodied with a heavenly satin-like entry. The acidity is perfectly pitched, this Nuits building in the mouth toward a complete, harmonious, almost Romanee-Saint-Vivant like finish that caresses the mouth and exudes wonderful mineralite. This transcends the vintage.

Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

248,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2011 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes is one of my favorite Premier Crus of the appellations (although Lalou rebuked by suggestion that it can occasionally be a Grand Cru quality!) It has an understated, refined, focused bouquet that builds with aeration: blackberry, a touch of bay leaf, minerals and a distant trace of Provencal herbs. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe tannins and a silky smooth texture; layers of black and red fruit suffused with minerals and just a touch of spice-box toward the long, intense finish. C’mon ... this would embarrass a few Grand Crus Lalou?but maybe from other growers. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain.

249,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2011 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has a sedate, refined bouquet or raspberry preserve, wild strawberry and a touch of wild hedgerow – airy and lifted. The palate is silky smooth on the entry. It is very harmonious and feminine with a succulent, sweet red currant and strawberry finish with just a tincture of vanilla. This is gorgeous and very seductive.

250,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"There is just one barrel of the 2011 Nuits-St-Georges Aux Bas de Combe that has the most straight-laced bouquet of the three Nuits-St-Georges 2011s: a little rounded on the nose with hints of mulberry infusing the black fruit. The palate is the most structured, the tannins forming a fine chassis for the pure black cherry, dark plum and spicy fruit, a clever dash of white pepper sprinkled over the finish when nobody was looking. Superb.

251,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2011 Nuits St.Georges Les Allots has a striking bouquet, more immediate than the Pommard with lifted mineralite, beautifully defined and focused. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, waves of black currant and raspberry fruit underlined by superb tension and poise. Everything is reined in toward the finish that is very composed with a long aftertaste and spicy coda. Excllent.

252,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2011 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots-les-Milieu comes from a parcel that Lalou’s family had been buying since 1949. It has an extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve, wild strawberry, cold stone and cheeky touch of marmalade. The palate is structured on the entry: a little more masculine than her other crus with a tightly wound finish. A little more closed than say, Dominique Lafon’s 2011, encountered the previous day, and probably deserving two or three years in bottle.

253,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges 1er Cru Aux Vignerondes has a pretty bouquet that is initially taciturn, opening with blackberry, cola, a touch of broom and wilted rose petals. The palate is rounded and lithe in the mouth, the oak a little more pronounced at the moment although that will be subsumed with the passing of time. There is a gradual build toward a complete, caressing black cherry and black olive finish, a spicy note on the aftertaste so that you do not forget it in a hurry.

The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy, almost corpulent entry. It has very fine volume in the mouth, fanning out on the broad dark plum and mulberry infused finish. This is one of the most approachable of Lalou’s 2011s and can just be summed up in the word, delicious.

The palate is full in the mouth: a Chambolle with fine volume, just a touch of graininess with hints of cooked meat infused the red fruit profile that lends it a savory feel. There is lovely length here. The finish is understated, leaving just a touch of soy lingering at the back of the mouth.

256,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Latricieees-Chambertin Grand Cru showed a little reduction on the nose, although rigorous swirling remedied that. It offers a broody bouquet with dark fruit: blackberry and Dorset plum, but it will offer more in the future. The palate is medium-bodied with an attractive chewy entry, a nice grip and a long succulent finish. This is a fine 2011 but for me, not quite at the ethereal level of Lalou Bize-Leroy’s other Grand Crus. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

257,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2011 Pommard Les Vignots was bottled December 2012. It has a complex, slightly earthy bouquet with subtle marine influences, defined and focused with hints of black olive emerging with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with fine focus, imbued with an Oriental edge (hoisin) which is folded into a fine silky finish. Drink now-2020.

258,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee Les Genaivrieres, which lies in close proximity to Lalou’s maison in Vosne, shows a touch of reduction on the nose with primal red rather than black fruit. It comes across as a little conservative after the wonderful Nuits 2011s. The palate is silky smooth on the entry, very refined with supple, lithe tannins. There are plenty of pure dark cherry and raspberry preserve notes to enjoy with a sedate, comfy finish that has a lovely caressing texture.

259,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"This is the third time that I have tasted the Corton-Charlemagne from Lalou-Bize Leroy. Here, the nose is a little more reticent than the last bottle in early 2012, but it opens immediately to reveal that rich, almost honeyed aroma, though here I notice a slight kerosene-like tincture. The palate is medium-bodied, powerful and very well-balanced with that core of spicy, honeyed fruit and a touch of glycerin on the weight finish. It is a sensual Corton-Charlemagne, but as I have commented before, it does not express the terroir with the clarity of others Leroy wines that I have tasted. Tasted May 2013.",,RP (94-96)
260,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the clear highlights of the vintage, the 2010 Musigny is simply magnificent. It possesses stunning depth and richness in all directions, with seemingly endless nuances that open up in the glass. A spherical, totally stratospheric wine, the Musigny is deeply resonant yet weightless. It is a standout in this flight of grand crus from Lalou Bize-Leroy. This is the purest essence of Musigny. Anticipated maturity: 2025-2045.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable. There is no more ardent exponent of the most fundamental of all Burgundian values – the concept of terroir – than Lalou Bize-Leroy.

Today the Brulees is much more open than it was a few months ago, but its potential is the same, which is to say, the wine is simply magnificent. In 2010, the Brulees is pure seduction. Rich, dense, yet light on its feet, the Brulees is marvelously complex, but in the end, it is the sheer texture of the wine that delights the intellectual and hedonistic senses most of all. The seductive, ethereal finish leaves a lasting impression. Tasted next to Beaux Monts, which this parcel is adjacent to, the Brulees is intensely floral and precise, with more of a dark red fruit profile.

Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable. There is no more ardent exponent of the most fundamental of all Burgundian values – the concept of terroir – than Lalou Bize-Leroy.

272,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Pure grace is what comes to mind as I taste the 2010 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres. Sweet red berries, hard candy, flowers, mint and spices waft from the glass. The wine gains volume and amplitude on the mid-palate, while never abandoning its sense of pure weightless elegance. Silky tannins frame an exquisite, utterly impeccable finish. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.

Waves of sumptuous dark fruit saturate the palate in this decidedly ripe, flashy Burgundy. Today, the Santenots is a bit oaky, while the style is on the edge of being over the top, neither of which was evident from barrel. The 2010 will appeal most to readers who like big, dramatic Burgundies. It is the only 2010 here (and at D’Auvenay) that came in at the lower end of my barrel scores.

This is a knock out set of wines from Lalou Bize-Leroy. Cold weather during the flowering reduced her already minuscule yields even further. As in many domaines, the most dramatic proof of the low yields was in the skimpy number of barrels to be seen in the cellars. There are a number of totally transcendental wines in this lineup. As always the wines were made with 100% stems and aged in 100% new barrels. The 2010s are notable for so many reasons, most importantly of all, though, they provide a window to the essential qualities of many of Burgundy’s top sights as seen through the lens of one of the region’s most brilliant and inspired vigneronnes.

Time spent with the wine is immensely rewarding, as the Chambertin is constantly changing in the glass, challenging the taster to keep up with its sheer pedigree. This is all nuance and class. I also tasted the 2010 from barrel, and it was beyond profound. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.

293,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2009 Volnay Santenots du Milieu comes across as quite dark and inward. Iron, tar, minerals, earthiness and dark fruit are some of the notes that emerge from this powerful Burgundy. The Santenots du Milieu shows remarkable inner tension and energy, with insistent mineral and floral notes that give lift to the finish. This is another strong effort, but not as exciting as Lalou Bize’s 2009s from the C?te de Nuits. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2029.  

This was my first opportunity to taste the 2009s from Domaine Leroy in bottle. Lalou Bize-Leroy was among the first, if not the first, to bottle her 2009s, so she naturally wanted to give the wines some time to recover before showing them. The wines are stunning. Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top?

295,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2009 Pommard Vignots is remarkably centered and poised from start to finish. It shows terrific minerality to balance its inner sweetness. The wine literally explodes on the mid-palate and finish with compelling red fruit, rose petals and tar. The flavors continue to build through to the multi-dimensional, textured finish.

Dark plums, cherries and spices are some of the notes that take shape in the glass. this is a decidedly delicate style for Nuits and today it doesn’t appear the Vignerondes has quite the stuffing to handle the 100% new oak. It is still a beautiful wine, though, and most growers (or consumers!) would be thrilled to have a wine like this in their cellars. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.

Crushed flowers, spices and sweet red berries sit on a core of silky tannins. This is an especially refined, textured Burgundy of immensely early appeal, even if it lacks the sheer excitement of the finest 2009s here.

299,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The classic scents of rose petal and licorice, allied to game, cassis, and dark cherry along with ethereal, penetrating distilled herbs and berries make for a heady aromatic display in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Chambertin, then exhibit themselves on a palate that combines richness and vivacity, textural allure with firm underlying structure, and above all density with uncanny levity. The incursion of salted red meat juices lends another layer of complexity while tugging relentlessly at your salivary glands, whereas fruit pit piquancy and chalky minerality in no way deflect the purity of this Chambertin’s inexorable fountain of fruit. This is one of those instances were a wine is so arresting it takes control of you. I felt enervated and afterward exhausted. For the few lucky enough to acquire three bottles of this, perhaps one per decade would be the proper measure. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates.

300,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The remarkably maritime mingling of salt spray, alkali, kelp, iodine, and crustacean present in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Romanee-St.-Vivant could, I think, only have come from this amazing site. Bright red raspberry and pungent ginger and black pepper, add to the invigorating and enticingly savory salinity on a buoyant palate at once subtly creamy and bright. Ocean meets forest as brooding, decadent notes of underbrush and other woodsy organic remains emerge; while musky narcissus and bitter-sweet gentian add enchanting inner-mouth perfume. All the while, there is a keenly kinetic interaction of all these elements. The finishing sense of shrimp and lobster shell reduction allied to persistently bright, downright refreshing red fruits is as uncanny as it is irresistibly coercive of the next sip. And if this wine doesn’t leave you salivating helplessly, I suspect you have glandular medical issues. My Leroy vintage tasting had reached a point where I was caught between the anticipation of those inevitably great wines that lay ahead, and a desire to simply cancel the rest of my work day and spend it sipping and contemplating this Romanee-St.-Vivant. But I still had inter alia eight Leroy grand crus to go – which signals something interesting. Madame Bize-Leroy served this ahead of all her grand crus save the Corton, perhaps because this is ultimately more delicate. It’s also less dark in color than its siblings. This should offer profound and dazzling complexity for 25 or 30 years provided you can uphold your end of the deal.

301,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"If I was expecting density and formidable tanninity from Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Clos Vougeot – and I guess that, relatively speaking, I was – it surprised me with its remarkable sense of buoyancy and transparency. The extract and the tannic underpinnings are there, but felt in the background – or like the ground you walk on and whose support you don’t think about. Through a deep pool of grenadine, cherry and red meat juices are glimpsed heliotrope and narcissus perfume; rose hip, black tea and licorice; salt and crushed stone. An invigoratingly tart kick of berry skin and rhubarb adds to the kinetic intensity of an exhilarating finish. In 25 years I suspect this will still have sap and energy in reserve. It is a Clos Vougeot like no other I can recall.

302,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, jasmine, peat, charred red meat, and fresh dark berries scent and saturate the firm but expansive palate of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Latricieres Chambertin. Much of the same “blood of the stones” sense of mineral saturation emerges here as on the corresponding 2007, but this wine’s dark family of flavors is allied to almost blazing brightness of fresh fruit acidity in a manner that – along with its underlying firmness – calls to mind 2005. What’s more, for all of this wine’s full-court-press of flavor, dark depth, and bedrock-firm structure, it reveals an uncanny sense of sheer levity that presages future elegance. My palate just can’t shake loose its array of flavors. I’m guessing that 25 years from now this great wine and its 2005 counterpart will still seem like remarkable twins separated at birth. (Please don’t imagine them in a ring together, though, duking it out to determine a winner.)

303,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Hints of game and animal fur as well as musky perfume of peony and narcissus all contribute funk to the aromatic complexity of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Aux Brulees, whose sweet side is represented by ripe black fruits, garlanded in heliotrope and fading lily. A marine alliance of alkalinity and mouthwateringly salinity joins peat, chalk, black tea, and forest underbrush and detritus on a silken, strikingly buoyant palate that really takes one on a tour of the dark, decadent mansion of Vosne-Romanee. This finishes darkly, deeply, envelopingly – and yet, the vivacious impingement of fresh berries, piquancy of tea and fruit pit, and invigorating pungency of mineral salts offer quickening 2008 typicity as well as a striking sense of counterpoint. This fits the Burgundian saying about Pinot offering a glass of night before you go into your own long night, and I hope to meet this sinisterly profound Vosne once more before The Reaper calls me. This wine harbors 20-25 years of vigor. (About myself, I’m a little less sure.)

304,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2008 Musigny is firm in texture and initially relatively reticent in aroma. Roasted red meat richness and decadently game-like elements put me a bit in mind of what I had expected from the corresponding Vougeot, but a blooming profusion of musky floral perfume bespeaks Musigny. There is a subtle oiliness of texture coating the tannins here and a tiny-berry concentration of diverse red fruits is shadowed by their ethereal distilled counterparts as well as by Chartreuse-like high-toned herbal evocations. This Musigny’s sheer sappy concentration, formidable structure, and carnal depth preclude its being charming or seductive in the unforgettable manner of its 2007 predecessor. But that doesn’t mean the finish here isn’t spellbinding or that the wine won’t bewitch you. Here, I suspect, is another candidate for a quarter-century’s enthralling evolution.

305,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons is one in a long line of amazing demonstrations that this site can deliver profound complexity and pleasure, but I doubt that there has been – and certainly I haven’t tasted – a more impressive instance, or indeed any more impressive young Savigny. Site-typical carnal elements in the nose are especially clean rather than gamy, and allied to suggestions of red fruit distillates, ocean spray, and forest floor. An infectiously mouthwatering savor of tiny red fruits (lingonberry, red currant, fraise du bois); red filet-mignon juices; rich beef marrow; mineral salts; leather; and brown spices floods and invigorates the texturally seamless, incipiently satiny palate in a show of palpable density and gripping persistence that somehow also leaves room for tenderness. Tea like smokiness and tannin that suffuse this Savigny similarly do not preclude a vintage-typical sense of vivacity. A vibratory, kaleidoscopic finish caps this thrilling effort that ought to be worth following for a quarter century.

The invigorating, saliva-inducing salinity here mounts along with the fruit intensity on a trumpet-like finish. It’s easy at this address to become inured to complexity, but I think it’s fair to say that this Richebourg does not quite reach the level in that department of the very finest Leroy 2008s. Perhaps that will come. What is amazing for now is above all this wine’s clarion intensity and sheer palate persistence. It should be given at least 8-10 years in cellar with the confidence that it will thereafter perform brilliantly for at least an equal interval.

307,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"After the amazing performance of its 2007 predecessor, I was especially keen to see what the Leroy 2008 Clos De La Roche held in store, especially given the energetic proclivities of its vintage. Cedar, quarry dust, and aromas of clean raw red meat ally themselves with intensely ripe cherry and black raspberry, which acquire a liqueur-like richness on a palate whose texture is as seamless as is the uncanny welding of distilled and confitured fruits, chalk and subtly oaky elements it manages to achieve. Here’s an instance, though, where 2007 beats 2008 at its own high-energy game. Still, this hauntingly-long 2008 is remarkable in its way, and doubtless poised to reveal further complexity to accompany its amazing richness over the next two decades.

This manages to be palpably extract-rich yet buoyant, tannic yet polished and inextinguishably juicy.

310,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Dark cherry and cassis infused with juniper berry, chalk dust, and decomposing wood provocatively scent the Leroy 2008 Corton Renardes, the addition of cherry pit bitterness on its silken palate pulling it in an almost austere direction from which the essential primary fruit juiciness so typical for the best of this vintage pulls it back. Beneath the layer of satin one senses a fine-grained structure as formidable as are this wine’s sense of somehow tasteable chalky mother rock and the vino-electric power dammed up behind it. This is a model of rectitude and its finish of pure, unwavering penetration. It’s also more latent than actualized. To follow its evolution over the next 20 or more years would be thrilling.

This gripping, energetic Pinot is far from the subtlest or most refined of Leroy 2008s, but its impressive virtues should merit following for the better part of two decades.

313,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"There are hints of game and even a whiff of manure on the nose of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts in a manner for which other wines in this collection will already have prepared you, here accompanied by smoky black tea and peat, along with ripe black fruits that come to the palate piquantly as well as tartly invigorating. Neither the mysterious low tones and minerality nor the vivacity of the corresponding Brulees are present here, but there is an almost implosive, sap-like sense of tiny-berry concentration mingled with resin and meat stock reduction that you simply can’t get off of your palate. I suspect that we’re dealing here with a late-bloomer and would wait to revisit this for at least half a dozen years, figuring that it will be well worth following for at least 15-20.  

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards.

314,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Leroy’s 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes offers complex scents and flavors of smoky black tea, humus, and plum pit, along with ripe, fleshy, faintly tart-edged dark cherry and purple plum. Polished in texture and generously rich, this comes to a long but surprisingly sedate conclusion, both soothing and stimulating, although not exhilarating in the manner of the finest wines in this collection. Taken by itself, though, rather than in comparison, this is impressively refined and complex Pinot. Perhaps time will bring greater eloquence. I cannot imagine this rewarding fewer than a dozen years of repeat visits.

315,Domaine Duroche,Pommard Les Vignots,"The Leroy 2008 Pommard Les Vignots displays a vivacity throughout that is quite vintage-typical but in my experience rare at this address. Smoked meat and rich marrow lend a strikingly carnal cast. Cherry pit and marine minerality lead to a dynamic finishing interchange of invigorating bitterness and salinity against a refined, transparent, and downright refreshing layering of red berry and meat. This ought to be worth following for at least the next dozen years.

316,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Sweetly ripe cherry and raspberry in Leroy’s 2008 Volnay Santenots du Milieu, are overlain with sweet, smoky, machine oil-like pungency as well as decadently floral and faintly fecal notes that suggest brettanomyces, and will render this wine controversial. A bright burst of vintage-typical fresh red raspberry and cherry juiciness emerges at mid-palate, where an uncanny balance of incipient creaminess and brightness is also suggested, but there is a very slight tendency toward dryness in an otherwise pungently-persistent and sweetly-ripe finish. Having a chance to taste these wines but once, I shall only voice as a suspicion that this is one Leroy Pinot liable to stray from the straight and narrow.

317,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Musigny presents in many respects a more profound and concentrated variation on her superb Chambolle Charmes of the vintage. Its tear-jerking brightness of cherry and raspberry fruit and their distilled essences, decadent florality, and saliva-inducing maritime depth are extraordinary. The carnality here is akin to foie gras and the umami-rich crustacean aspect akin to sea urchin roe and lobster shell reduction. Hints of blond tobacco, peat, iris, fruit pit, and a hit of caramel add further, bittersweet nuance to an already multidimensional experience. Richly and tenderly-fruited and –textured, yet vivacious and penetrating, this should continue to perform astonishingly over the next two decades if not beyond. 

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

318,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, rose petal, and dark cherry in the site-typical nose of Leroy’s 2007 Chambertin lead to a sumptuous, silken, sweetly-fruited palate that for all of its richness displays lift and elegance, and for all of its sucrosity harbors irresistible saline and carnal savor, rendering a saliva-inducing, tongue-titillating finish. As with the corresponding Clos Vougeot, it’s almost hopeless to try to dissect this further with flailing descriptors. Suffice it to say that yes, it is regal and suggests that a benign monarch might make for the best form of red Burgundy, a hypothesis that I suspect will withstand two decades or more of testing.

319,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Kirsch, rose hip, and soy intensely scent the Leroy 2007 Clos De La Roche, which reveals brightness and finesse as well as a saline savor unusual for its appellation. To be sure, notes of leather and crushed stone as well as smoked and roasted meats contribute further and perhaps more site-typical complexity. But it’s the sheer finesse, buoyancy, and vibratory energy on display that most amaze, leaving your tongue and gums a quiver and your salivary glands pumping helplessly. There is also a faint hint of heat, but its effect is negligible given what’s going on around you when you swallow (or, in my case, spit). Look for 20 or more years of excitement.

Dark berries and dark, mossy, humus-rich forest floor; saline, crustacean-reduction, and oyster flesh mineral-animal savor; sweetly ripe raspberry, all follow from the nose across a sumptuously rich palate, and into a prodigious, saliva-inducing finish. A trace of warmth (rare in the present collection) doesn’t detract noticeably from what is an extraordinary performance. Follow it over the next 20 years.

321,Domaine Duroche,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Clos Vougeot issues from three parcels at different elevations of the clos, and the belief (in which she is hardly alone) that such a range of parcels better expresses the essence of this cru is lent credibility in the glass. Ripe plum, cherry and their pits; roasted meats; salt and crushed stone are all prominent in a Pinot of formidable aromatic and gustatory intensity; abundant but refined tannin; and a reverberative finish that rings changes on your palate. The depth of rich meatiness; succulence of dark fruits; and formidable minerality are difficult to break down into further descriptive details, but taking a sip of this is like turning your palate and imagination over to auto-pilot, and if you cellar some, I suspect it will still be capable of holding you hostage and challenging the prowess of its 2005 counterpart two decades from now.

The least evident aspect of the sappy concentrate that stains the taste buds on this occasion is sheer (mere?) sweetness of fruit, and this is a wine to explore over the next two decades with the aid of scuba gear and a geologist’s pick.

323,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2006 Latricieres Chambertin smells of peat, soy, game, and bloody meat juices, which figure on a palate of compressed intensity. Talk about “blood of the stones” – this seems to epitomize that phrase, although some of the iron-rich, corpuscular, animal variety is flowing through its veins as well. The presence of tart red berry concentrate seems almost incidental in the present context. A sort of sepulchral depth and stony fundament lend this severely palate-staining Pinot an aura of mystery. But it isn’t a charmer, and in its present state one imagines a vampire would find it more enticing than would a normal pinotphile. The sense of awed anticipation – of what this might become in 10-20 years – is its greatest attraction, in which respect, too, it is singular among 2007s.

324,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Its forward, succulent sweetness of red raspberry and purple plum fruit accompanied by blond tobacco and smoked meat set Leroy’s 2007 Richebourg apart from its Romanee-St.-Vivant sibling, whose utterly contrasting personality may convey more alluring mystery and complexity, but cannot compete with the sheer sappy concentration and particular energy and exuberance on display. There is a meaty savor, smoky tang, and brightness of berry fruit that truly stains the palate. I expect this is another Leroy wine that will defy its vintage by retaining stamina for two or more decades, and in the process will almost certainly reveal further facets.

This is one of those red Burgundies that prompts you to wonder how such flavors could come from grapes, but that at the same time seems uncannily at home mingling with saliva in human mouths. It also perfectly exemplifies the iron-first-in-velvet-glove metaphor with a chain mail-like sense of fine-grained resilience that in no way detracts from textural allure. Bize-Leroy compares this (like several in Savigny) under-rated site with Corton, and the analogy is especially apt in such an instance of grand cru aspirations fulfilled.

She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

328,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The Leroy 2007 Vosne-Romanee Aux Genaivrieres is scented with red raspberry, rose hip, citrus oils, and discreet perfume of narcissus and faded lily. Refined and subtly creamy in texture, yet bright, and subtly decadent in its floral and forest floor intimations; this brings to bear a mouth-watering saline savor in a buoyant, billowing finish. Look for at least 12-15 years of pleasure from these fruits of Domaine Leroy’s “home” vineyard.

Plush and creamy yet buoyant and fresh-fruited, it opens up on the palate a subtle expanse of velvety, mossy forest floor as well as deep stock-like meatiness, finishing with long, intertwined mineral, carnal, floral, ripe black fruit, and arboreal strands.

330,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Haunting aromas of violet, morellos, kirsch and sea spray mark Leroy’s 2007 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes, leading to a palate impression of refreshment and striking transparency to saline, chalky, crustacean, kelp-like, and meat stock elements. This is as tenderly-fruited, finesseful, buoyant, and downright refreshing a Pinot as I can imagine issuing from Nuits-St.-Georges, even if it lacks the sort of profound richness that more often characterizes the best wines from this domaine. I suspect it will remain well worth re-visiting for a dozen or more years, but (on the counterfactual assumption that I could both locate and afford some of this) I would not want to miss out on experiencing its youthful charms as well.

Expansive and overtly ripely fruited, yet firm, and more restrained in the finish than its aromas and initial palate impression led me to expect, here is a Vosne whose deep layers can almost certainly be mined only over a period of 10-15 years.

Tender in fruit and silken in texture, this holds an irresistible immediate appeal, yet in addition to its sense of carnality it exhibits chalk, salt, iodine, and peat in its long, savory, saliva-inducing finish.

Satiny in texture and richly-ripe, at the same time this maintains a keen edge and offers a lovely sense of sheer refreshment.

Notes of chalk accent a for 2007 unusually refreshing finish. Here is another wine of this collection one need have no compunction about enjoying in its youth, although I suspect it would continue to reward an owner for at least 6-8 years.

Expansively rich and sweetly-fruited, the sheer abundance of this wine’s tannins reveals itself only on a delayed basis, and even then with a persistent sense of envelopment by ripe dark berry concentrates. I miss the sense of mystery or elegance that accrues to the best 2007 Leroy wines, but it, is of course, early days for a Pinot I suspect will merit following for more than a decade and which might well in the process reveal further nuance.

Less refined in texture or refreshing (despite a tart fruit skin edge) than most Pinots in the present collection, it finishes with decisive chalkiness and persistent ripe fruit, but it isn’t clear to me that its faintly gum-numbing sense of tannic firmness will translate into longevity. Here’s one Leroy 2007 I would approach the same way as so many others of its vintage, namely to cellar for at most a few years, watchfully and recognizing that the wine might of course make a fool of me.

337,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Lavieres marries bright cherry fruit with game, black tea, and leather both in the nose and on the palate, where its juicy primary fruit is laced with cherry pit bitterness as well as animal allusions. Smoky, faintly bitter black tea is emphasized along with leather in a finish satisfyingly persistent if not refined or polished. This might well become more focused and shed its slight rusticity with time in bottle. In any case, I foresee no problem with following it over at least the next 5-7 years.

The opaque sense of richness here is at odds with the norm among Leroy 2007s and is literally reflected in the glass by the wine’s turbidity. For now, the finishing fruit has to work hard to overcome gum- and lip-numbing tannin of a sort that I do not think is merely being temporarily accentuated and that I am not convinced – Leroy’s obvious belief to the contrary notwithstanding – conduces to long-term cellaring. That said, I would, of course, be delighted if she and this wine – neither of which I challenge lightly – made me look foolish a dozen years hence.

339,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"Initially a bit reduced, the Leroy 2006 Musigny responded to a shaking, blossoming into a wealth of floral perfumes, ripe fresh red fruits, citrus oils, and marine breeze. Strikingly vivacious and buoyant on the palate as well as silken in texture, this at the same time reveals a deeply meaty and stony undertone. The finish dynamically weaves its berry-intense, carnal, mineral, and floral strands into a long, colorful braid. And in the empty glass you realize that the spell of reduction is now completely broken and an eruption of floral perfume and of spirituous as well as fresh red fruit essences ensues. This is another great 2006 representative of its site in the making, as well as another demonstration of how beautifully suited the vintage is to expressing this site's virtues and vice-versa. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest. Despite their winsomeness, they have long life expectancies. Since, however, I have very little experience of their predecessors as they have matured, I have confined my prognostication to a few isolated and very general comments in the tasting notes that follow. Note that I have included as well under the heading ""Leroy"" the wines of Madame Bize-Leroy's Domaine d'Auvenay – its cellars located outside Saint-Romain – which now encompass two appellations in red, since inevitably when information is being sought about these wines, and even often when they are described, it is under the name ""Leroy.""

Suggestions of quince and honey along with lily perfume give the aromas an exotically, almost white wine dimension. On the palate this is liquid floral perfume and silk along with the essence of red fruits and hints of nut oils. But the dark, decadent suggestions of humus, peat, game, and otherwise ineffable mineral notes one anticipates from the best exemplars of the site are hauntingly present as well. This epitomizes the refinement and buoyancy of which its vintage is capable, finishing with cycloramic scope and symphonic length.

341,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The Leroy 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes smells mouth-wateringly of fresh fraise du bois, kirsch, lilies, and a whiff of wood smoke. Tiny-berried concentration of red fruits; a tender, silken texture; and a sensation of lift and wafting delicacy put this in a category of its own, much as the 2005 rendition distinguished itself by being far and away the most refreshing and precisely-delineated in flavors of its collection. There is a shimmering interchange of fruit, flowers, and subtly saline mineral and carnal savor here that will keep you transfixed, your tongue trembling, and your salivary glands out of control. Here is a wine that epitomizes the classic conception of Chambolle as a wine of elegance and finesse, as well as epitomizing the potential of the 2006 vintage. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest.

342,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Haunting rose petal, anise, and ripe cherry in the nose of Bize-Leroy's 2006 Chambertin signal a classic of its appellation, and the texturally-caressing, mouth-coating impression that follows tells you that this will be singularly 2006 in its tenderness and youthful approachability. Like the corresponding Latricieres, you have to look hard to find this Chambertin's abundance of fine tannin, as the flavors seem almost to hover over the palate, and its long finish practically dissolves into sheer inner-mouth perfume. The suggestions of carnal and mineral nuance here are extremely subtle – though almost sure to grow with time – and it is the wine's remarkably ethereal yet intense presence of sweetness and perfume that render it already unforgettable.

Creamy, gently soothing, and generously broad and sweetly-fruited in a manner one doesn't anticipate from its site, this Pinot's mineral and animal dimensions only strongly reassert themselves in the long, strikingly buoyant finish, along with black tea, distilled essences of red berries, and peat. This is one of many wines of its collection almost certain to gain in nuance and allure with a few years in bottle, although it is frankly irresistible now.

344,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Given the many extraordinary examples of Corton in this vintage, I was inevitably full of anticipation in approaching the Leroy 2006 Corton Renardes, and it did not disappoint. Ripe purple plum and quarry dust scent the nose. On the palate, the rich fruit here seems to oscillate in counterpoint with mineral nuances for a vibratory expression of vinous energy and complexity, and while the texture is velvet-like there is both a sense of primary juiciness and of lift that make for elegance, refreshment, and youthful accessibility one wouldn't ordinarily encounter in great Corton. The underlying structure is present for long aging, to be sure, but is almost undetectably woven into the wine's fabric. As this opened to the air, animal notes added to the intriguing mineral dimensions, and finish really took flight.

345,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Smoky pungency mingles with dark berry concentrates and bitter-sweet floral essences on the nose of the Leroy 2006 Richebourg. This Pinot strides magisterially onto the palate, with obvious firmness and depth of tannic tread, but at the same time a plush wealth of sweet black fruits that overrides the tannins and makes for a surprisingly soothing impression. Crushed stone and roasted meats add authority to a long finish in which rather obvious tannins returned. Somehow, the character of the vintage seems to suit the Romanee-St.-Vivant better than it does this Richebourg. But it's early days, especially for a wine of such sweetness of fruit, muscularity, and sheer extract as this. Furthermore, it's hard for me to discount the possibility that the unexpected and slightly awkward reappearance of tannins in the finish here might be a function of temporary perturbation or Burgundian Pinot moodiness.

This is truly like liquid silk, yet refreshing at the same time; intensely fruited (seemingly supported by a couple of grams of residual sugar) yet with plenty of Chambolle-typical carnality and minerality. Those few wine lovers able to afford and acquire it ought not to delay in enjoying at least a portion of their treasure.

Smoky, saline, and pungently herbal notes mingle with the carnal and berry-rich elements in a long finish of mouth-watering savor and invigoratingly pungent smokiness.

Rich and velvety on the palate, this favors the soothing rather than invigorating or refreshing side of 2006, with a metaphorically dark, decadent complexity that puts me more in mind of Romanee St.-Vivant than it does of Richebourg, very near to which this wine grew. Fine tannins become more evident in the long, low-toned finish than they are on the mid-palate, but I could well imagine this maturing beautifully for 12-15 years without any awkward stretches.

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest. Despite their winsomeness, they have long life expectancies. Since, however, I have very little experience of their predecessors as they have matured, I have confined my prognostication to a few isolated and very general comments in the tasting notes that follow. Note that I have included as well under the heading ""Leroy"" the wines of Madame Bize-Leroy's Domaine d'Auvenay – its cellars located outside Saint-Romain – which now encompass two appellations in red, since inevitably when information is being sought about these wines, and even often when they are described, it is under the name ""Leroy.""

356,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The Leroy 2006 Vosne-Romanee Aux Genaivrieres smells darkly of blackberry, mossy forest floor, roasted meat, and decadent floral perfume. In terms of fruit freshness, though, this is bright, while also displaying a hint of tannic grit. Its lingering finish returns to the dark side, with intriguing intimations of future complexity, though only time, I think, will reveal how this wine's tannins are resolved.

357,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Smoked meat and fresh dark cherry in the nose of Leroy's 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes lead to a broad, sweetly-fruited palate enhanced by savory carnality and salinity. Compared with most of the wines here today, this lacks a bit of finishing refinement and lift, and there is a faint gum numbness after the fruit has faded. That said, we are still in the realm of concentration, sumptuousness, and healthy ripeness – indeed, near over-ripeness – that cannot help but impress.

358,Domaine Duroche,Musigny Grand Cru,"I had to draw a deep breath in anticipation of what would rise from my glass of Leroy 2005 Musigny, and in that moment Madame Leroy trenchantly observed that “it’s another world” down in there. Tea, ginger, tangerine rind, myriad sweet flowers, cherry distillate, truffles, and fraise des bois preserves are among the scents that pour forth. Bloody fresh meat and implacable chalk join the medley of fruit, floral and spice concentrates on a palate whose texture “polish,” “refinement,” or “velvet” are pitifully inadequate to describe. For all of its amazing richness, this displays more of a confident inner sweetness than a superficial sucrosity, and there is no lack of sheer energetic brightness of fruit and drive. Indeed, seatbelts would be advised before attempting to swallow this elixir, such is the phenomenal thrust of its finish.

359,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Chambertin (like her Musigny and Clos Vougeot, from three parcels) leads with a knockout punch of super-concentrated, liqueur-like black raspberry, cassis, and licorce, rose petal (no, make that the whole rose garden!), and deep, roasted meatiness. Monumentally dense, yet vibrant and energetic, this builds momentum on the palate as it adds black pepper, tactile cinnamon spice, and distilled fruit and herb concentration. I have seldom experienced such a literal (not to mention phenomenally long) finish: it simply wiped the floor with your humble critic. If I were ever to encounter this wine in the ring again, I pray that it won’t be for at least a decade (and that it spots me 98 points).

360,Domaine Duroche,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Leroy’s 2005 Romanee-St.-Vivant is improbably dark and deep in color even by her standards, and darkness and depth characterize its personality as well. Clove, cumin, cocoa powder, lily, and black pepper complement a nose of distinctly liqueur-like black fruits. In the mouth, this is liquid velvet. Chocolate-covered black cherries, plum preserves, and truffles are laced with creme de cassis and soy, underlain by a decidedly stony, chalky minerality and a fine but firm web of tannin. By now one realizes that 2005 is an exceptional vintage for this site in and of itself, but one would never confuse the D.R.C. or Potel renditions with this flamboyant, extravagantly-rich version from Leroy.

361,Domaine Duroche,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"A dizzying and seductive bouquet incorporating licorice, spice cake, cherry preserves, and humus announces the arrival of a 2005 Latricieres-Chambertin that takes the smooth, silken-creamy texture of so many of these Leroy 2005s to a new level. Interestingly, this is a bit less deep in color than the rest of today’s grand cru company, and is visibly unfiltered. Explosively intense yet clear as a bell in its finish of licorice and cherry, and with ferocious animal intensity and a veritable smelting of ore-like minerals (could these be Latriciere’s notorious iron asserting itself?), this marks the point at which true geeks will get out their stopwatches and start timing. It comes off as almost spare in the context of Leroy other 2005s, and it won’t be everyone’s cup of Pinot, but I would dearly love to revisit it in 8-10 years.

362,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The parcel that informs a 2005 Clos de la Roche touches Leroy’s Combottes. This wine smells of resin, tobacco, incense, roasted meats, wood smoke, wet stones, alongside stewed cherries and rhubarb. Roasted and stewy richness characterize the intimate meld of meat and fruit on the palate as well. For sheer density this is incredibly impressive, but it’s not at all lacking in the kinetic department, either. What is lacking is the perfume or pure clarity of fruit that the best of this collection display. Almost frighteningly gripping in the back (or on the way down, should you dare to swallow!) with an implosive display of meatiness and stony minerality, this will surely need years to reveal its full potential.

363,Domaine Duroche,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Their 2005 Richebourg leads with black raspberry liqueur, crystalized ginger, coconut, and candied violets. In the mouth, a meaty element, enhanced spiciness and a tart yet stewy rhubarb note emerge. To state that the overall impression is fat, full and creamy seems unnecessarily repetitive. But there is much more obvious tannin and new wood (even though it is the same 100%) in evidence than with the wines that proceeded it, and perhaps partly in consequence the formidably long finish is dominated by roasted meats with a sort of dry-rubbed spiciness, the suggestions of fruit more spiritous than fleshy. Still, the sheer intensity displayed is itself remarkable. This would be an amazing wine to revisit, but probably not inside a decade.

Yet for all of this sweetness in the nose, the wine comes to the palate refreshingly free of superficial sucrosity. Cherry pit bitterness and bright, ripe fruit acids, plus scintillating inner-mouth florality contribute to an impression of great precision and “cut” (the last word I would have used in describing any of the preceding Leroy 2005s) and the taster is carried away on a wafting wealth of finishing fruit, flowers, spice, marrow and chalk essence-of-Chambolle. (The texture is silken and refined to a remarkable but, in the Leroy context, by now routine degree.)

365,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2005 Corton Renardes smells of red cherry, charred wood, vanilla, and lily, but comes onto the palate particularly juicy as well as satisfyingly rich and expansive. This is silky in texture but bright and insistent in its sense of primary fresh fruit. A superbly long finish unites cherry liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla, chalk dust, and a savory meatiness, and the empty glass is sweetly perfumed with sensational intensity. I have never tasted a youthful Corton remotely so forward, perfumed, silken, or superficially sweet.

Polished and suave on the palate, with pure, sweet black cherry and raspberry fruit in both liqueur-like and fresh forms (as with so many of the wines in this collection), it also displays deep meat and mushroom stock and a singed, caramelized edge to the fruit. This epitomizes the concept “layered,” but on the other hand, it leaves no nooks or crannies for warts or quirky complexities to inhabit because it’s seamless.

Smoky, meaty aromas and a chalky density, smoky, salty meatiness along with black-fruited intensity on the palate are certainly in character for this appellation. This has girth and grip, a monumental structure and layering of meat, fruit, and mineral that lead one to anticipate formidable but glacial aging. There is not a lot of charm, no flattering high-toned perfume ... no, there is “just” a seamless meld of materials with massive yet superbly well-integrated tannic structure.

In the mouth, this exhibits real girth and grip, yet for all of the enveloping aspect of the fruit, there is plenty of bright freshness as well to carry into a finish with low-toned, up-welling of meat and minerals. This Nuits displays amazing richness, energy, and sheer intensity not to mention clarity of fruit.

Voluminous and luminous in the mouth, this exhibits a continuation of the Leroy alliance of liqueur-like and fresh fruit aspects, amazingly precocious and beguiling creaminess of texture, and deep meatiness, buried truffles, and soy-like savor. It may miss the mystery of a few of its predecessors, but like Leroy’s Santenots, this Beaux Monts is compellingly sweet, rich, seamless and pure. There is a sultry sense about it, but no real heat in the finish.

But while the liqueur-like expression of fruit persists throughout, a fresh, juicy invigorating fruit character comes to its aid to prevent the wine’s becoming cloying. This Pinot displays in spades the proclivity of some of the best 2005s to combine the maximum concentration and richness of fruit compatible with refreshing juiciness and elegance. The amazingly pure, luscious finish – tinged with vanilla and nutmeg notes from the barrel – goes on and on. I suppose there could (and may well with time) be more complexity here, but the purity of fruit, uncanny balance and sheer length are enough to wow me.

Lovely dark berries, black truffles, moss, subtle muskiness and animality mark its very ‘05 and very noir palate, like an expansive, magic forest of flavors. The wine finishes with remarkable refinement and delicacy of plum and cherry fruit and a continuation of myriad mysterious fungal, scrub and animal shadings. Flatteringly creamy, it, however, shows a more tender and less obviously rich, sweet personality than most of Leroy’s wines.

A distinctively wet stone cast inflects the black fruits on the very full, rounded palate, and this wine’s long, strong finish is dominated by yet more sweet black fruit, plus red licorice, with only a low-toned growl of wild animal. And indeed, at least today, the personality of this wine is itself dominated by its concentrated, seamless finish.

Rich and creamy in the mouth, it nevertheless registers a brightness of fruit and invigorating cast as it spreads its charm to all corners of the palate. Porcine, smoky meatiness is never far from the surface, though, nor is a wet stone, chalky mineral cast that segues into the wine’s fine underlying tannins. A finish of sweet black currant fruit accompanied by bitter-sweet herbal notes offers exemplary transparency to floral nuances and underlying minerals. As with the Genaivrieres, there is plenty of delicious mystery here over which to scratch one’s head.

With that usually goes plenty of structure, and the present example will disappoint no one in this regard, as there are abundant albeit fine tannins to chew on. Almost inevitably though, from stem to stern, this has the trademark Leroy sweetness and richness of in this case black cherry, and the plushness covering the tannins. It finishes with formidable cling of sweet fruit, tobacco, roasted meats, and wet stones.

410,Domaine Duroche,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"As is often the case, Leroy’s Clos de la Roche was a standout in the 2001 vintage.

Deep plummy red fruits, black raspberries, juniper berries, cinnamon, and a myriad of other spices can be discerned in its gorgeously deep, muscular personality.

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

Its blackberry aromas lead to a broad, medium-bodied character filled with plump dark fruits. It lacks the power, concentration, as well as punch of Leroy’s finest Santenots, and reveals some stemmy characteristics in the finish, yet this wine bastes the taster’s palate with impressive layers of blackberries.

417,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"“My 2000 Corton-Charlemagne needs to age at least 50 years ... we will all be eating dandelions by the roots when it is ready to drink,” announced Mme. Bize-Leroy as she poured it into my glass. Intense aromas of poached pears, toasty minerals, and butter can be found in its complex aromas. A wine of exceptional concentration (its dry extract levels must be impressive!), it is hugely rich, lush, and dense. Buttered popcorn, ripe pears, and cashews are found in its medium to full-bodied, profound personality. While some readers may opt to heed Mme. Bize-Leroy’s half-century of cellaring recommendation, I would suggest drinking it over the next 15 years.  

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes.

418,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Medium to dark ruby-colored, the 2000 Chambertin exhibits tar-laced spicy black fruit aromas. This magnificent wine combines the generosity of fruit found in the finest offerings of the vintage with a power, depth, structure, and concentration that is typically lacking in the 2000s. Its intense and muscular flavor profile coats the taster’s palate with waves of super-ripe plums and blackberries whose effects linger throughout its regal, sweet finish. Certainly one of the finest reds produced in 2000, it will be at its peak of maturity between 2005 and 2014.

570,Domaine Duroche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  Her Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees is so sweet, seductive, opulent, unctuous, thick, and rich, yet never heavy or overbearing that it boggles the mind.  The taster truly senses the presence of something unreal.  One of the more forward of the Leroy 1993s, this wine can be drunk now or cellared for 20+ years.  When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

How do you describe the prodigious Nuits St.-Georges Les Boudots?  It is an awesome red Burgundy that is unconscionably concentrated, with extraordinary delineation to its personality, and massive ripeness and richness that buries what must be considerable tannin.  Approachable now, this phenomenal wine should be at its apogee by the turn of the century and drink well for 20-25 years.

As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

577,Domaine Duroche,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes adds spice, cinnamon, and smoky notes to the lavish quantities of sweet, jammy, red and black fruits.  This huge, rich, slightly tannic 1993 is a wine-making marvel.
When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""

The only hard tannin to be found in a Leroy 1993 is in the Pommard Trois Vollots.

582,Domaine Duroche,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The best value in Domaine Leroy's portfolio comes from the Cote de Beaune.  An exceptionally great wine produced by Bize-Leroy in 1992 is the Volnay Les Santenots.  Having tasted it several times from cask and twice from bottle, I can unequivocally state that the 1992 Volnay Les Santenots is a blockbuster, super-rich, authoritatively flavored yet wonderfully harmonious, elegant example of Volnay.  The color is a saturated dark ruby and the nose offers up super-intense, jammy scents of sweet black-cherry fruit intertwined with oak and floral notes.  It is a wine of extraordinary intensity, power, richness, and overall grace and harmony.  This is a winemaking tour de force!  Moreover, this must be the ""bargain"" wine of her portfolio.  It should drink well between 1998-2015.

I have said it so many times that it may seem redundant, but if you missed it in my 1990 tome, Burgundy, Lalou Bize-Leroy stands virtually alone at the top of Burgundy's quality hierarchy. Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.  Although not as phenomenally concentrated and extracted as her 1991s and 1990s, the 1992s are more closely aligned to her sumptuous 1989s.

Supple, full-bodied, never heavy or tannic, this smooth-as-silk wine is so concentrated that some powerful tannin is nearly hidden by the wine's gorgeous richness.

590,Domaine Duroche,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Lalou Bize-Leroy is assuming a stronger position in the village of Chambolle-Musigny and she has turned out a very fine 1992 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres.  The wine boasts an elegant, floral, vanillin, and cherry-scented nose, medium-bodied, concentrated flavors, a supple, velvety texture, and an easy-going, graceful, complex finish.  It should drink well for 12-15 years.  I did not have an opportunity to taste out of bottle Lalou's Musigny and Chambertin, but several cask tastings (she does not fine or filter) revealed that the 1992 Musigny looked to be the best wine in her entire portfolio.  It possessed that extra dimension of finesse as well as sensational concentration and a velvety-textured, sweet, ripe palate.  The 1992 Chambertin was also terrific, but perhaps less complex and impressive when compared to the Musigny.  If I get the chance to taste either or both of these wines from bottle on this side of the Atlantic, I will update readers with my opinions.

I have said it so many times that it may seem redundant, but if you missed it in my 1990 tome, Burgundy, Lalou Bize-Leroy stands virtually alone at the top of Burgundy's quality hierarchy.  Because she is a perfectionist, and because she has had the courage to produce wines from low yields and bottle them naturally, without fining or filtration, she has been scorned by many Burgundy negociants, and even by the proprietors of other top domaines.  Not only are they jealous, they are frightened of Bize-Leroy because they fear increasing pressure for lower yields and bio-dynamic farming. Anyone who loves great Burgundy, must realize that her wines embarrass much of what is produced in Burgundy. 

For the fifth consecutive vintage since she launched her wines from the Domaine Leroy (formerly the Noellat estate), Lalou Bize-Leroy has made the highest percentage of Burgundy's greatest wines.

591,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The best value in Domaine Leroy's portfolio comes from the Cote de Beaune.  The 1992 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons reveals a dark, saturated ruby color, a tight but promising nose of spice, black-cherries, and earth, and medium to full-bodied, concentrated flavors.  It can be drunk now, but it promises to be better in 1-2 years and last for 15 or more.

It possesses fine depth as well as a meaty, smoky character, but the wine's vegetal aspect is off-putting.

Once again, the remarkable Lalou Bize-Leroy and her gifted winemaker, Andre Porcheret, have made the wines of the vintage.

These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.
Produced according to the rigid disciplines of organic farming biodynamics, Lalou Bize-Leroy's 1991s are extraordinary.

NOTES ON THE 1992s FROM BARREL:  In what was a relatively light vintage for the Cote de Nuits, superb 1992s were produced at Leroy.

Picking a favorite is akin to splitting hairs, as they are all super-rich, densely colored, broadly built, expansive, full-bodied Pinot Noirs with superb complexity and richness.  The most opulent, hedonistic, and decadent of this trio of premier crus is the 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Boudots.  Its huge, exotic nose of smoke, ripe cassis fruit, herbs, minerals, and roasted nuts is a turn-on.  Low in acid, this blockbuster, massively concentrated, voluptuously-textured wine is a knock-out.  Drink it over the next 15-18 years.

It offers a decadent nose of smoked duck, grilled meats, black fruits, spices, and truffle-like smells. Superb black-cherry fruit flavors are loaded with glycerin and extract.  This unctuously-textured, hedonistic wine is remarkably long, sweet, and velvety.  Tasting more like an unevolved barrel sample than a finished wine, it should be drunk between 1996-2012.

Produced according to the rigid disciplines of organic farming biodynamics, Lalou Bize-Leroy's 1991s are extraordinary.

NOTES ON THE 1992s FROM BARREL:  In what was a relatively light vintage for the Cote de Nuits, superb 1992s were produced at Leroy.  Sadly, because of difficult weather in 1993 and Bize-Leroy's refusal to utilize anti-rot fungicides, over 80% of the crop was destroyed.  Consequently, there will be little wine coming from Leroy in 1993.",,RP 89
604,Domaine Duroche,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Allots exhibits a deep ruby color, a sweet nose of ripe fruit, medium body, excellent structure, moderate tannin, and that inner richness and mid-palate so often missing in modern day red burgundy.  The overall impression is of a supple-textured, ripe, concentrated, impressive wine with at least 12-15 years of cellaring potential.

Once again, the remarkable Lalou Bize-Leroy and her gifted winemaker, Andre Porcheret, have made the wines of the vintage.  Of course, Ponsot's Chambertin, Clos St.-Denis, and Clos de la Roche offer worthy competition, but considering the numerous vineyards she possesses, and the remarkable success she has enjoyed with all of them, she gets the gold medal in 1991.  These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.

With its dark, dense, ruby color and rich nose of ripe black fruits, this medium to full-bodied, supple wine is better than most premier crus.  Low yields and impeccable winemaking have elevated its quality to an amazingly high level.  Smooth enough to be approached now, this wine should continue to age well for another 10-15 or more years.

606,Domaine Duroche,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1991 Corton-Charlemagne from Domaine Leroy needs at least 10 years of cellaring.  It is a candidate for 25-30 years of aging.  Huge and massive, with great density, it is totally unevolved, with a reticent bouquet.  The power, weight, and density are something to behold, but this is an infantile, backward wine that should be purchased only by consumers with cold cellars and plenty of patience.  If you had a child born in 1991 and want a Chardonnay grand cru for his or her 21st birthday, this would be a great choice.

Lalou Bize-Leroy produced some remarkable 1991 white burgundies.  Yields averaged only 9 hectoliters per hectare in her Chardonnay vineyards and alcohol levels averaged 13.5%.  These wines will be the longest-lived whites of the 1991 vintage.

608,Domaine Duroche,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Insiders have long known that one of the treasures of the Leroy portfolio is the Savigny Les Beaune-Les Narbantons.  Consistently the finest wine made in that appellation, it achieves grand cru quality because of its extraordinary richness and multidimensional character.  The 1990 is awesome.  The forceful bouquet, which is just beginning to form, soars from the glass, offering up aromas of minerals, toasty oak, and gobs of black fruit.  In the mouth, there is magnificent richness, medium to full-body, and a layered, multi-dimensional, chewy texture that goes on and on.  The moderate tannins are nearly obscured by the wine's sweet concentration of fruit.  Anticipated maturity: 1996-2010+.

I suppose there is a natural tendency to overlook Madame Leroy's wines from the Cote de Beaune.  She, along with Faiveley and Jadot, makes one of the more flavorful generic red burgundies.

Do not touch a bottle before the turn of the century.

The roasted nose of meat and smoky black fruit is flashy and extroverted.  In the mouth, this wine exhibits a broad-shouldered, expansive, succulent texture, with oodles of flavor and glycerin, as well as heady alcohol to go along with the spectacularly rich, unctuous finish.  Even though the tannins are noticeable, it is a thrilling wine to drink at present.  It should be at its best by 1995 and last for 15 or more years.

The huge nose of roasted meats, pure black-raspberries, and herbs soars from the glass.  Full-bodied, with layer upon layer of rich, unctuous Pinot fruit, this super-concentrated, voluptuously textured wine is so rich that the formidable tannin levels are nearly concealed.

The sweet nose of coffee, caramel, black-cherries, and earth is a turn-on.  In the mouth, this full-bodied, voluptuously textured, superbly concentrated wine with no hard edges exhibits lavish quantities of jammy fruit buttressed nicely by new oak, decent acidity, and moderate tannins.  Although precocious, it needs another 4-5 years to develop even further, and should last for 20-25  years.

622,Domaine Duroche,Chambertin Grand Cru,"If it were not for the Romanee St.-Vivant and Richebourg, I would be ecstatic over the fabulous 25 cases of Chambertin that Lalou Bize-Leroy made in 1988. However, for now it must take a back seat to the other two wines. It is a big, rich, earthy, cinnamon, almost raunchy-scented wine, but is sensationally concentrated and full bodied, with fabulous balance and precision to its flavors.

Only 125 cases of this spectacular Vosne-Romanee were made from a vineyard planted in 1902. It is clearly indicative of what old vines and low yields can extract from a parcel that is not as well placed as the Premiers Crus or Grands Crus of Vosne-Romanee. Astonishingly deep, rich, and concentrated with gorgeous amounts of red and black fruits, this wine should drink well for another 10-15 years. Do not pass it up because it is only a Villages wine.

Soaring from the glass with a deep and profound bouquet of raspberries, cherries and plum preserve mingled with notions of Asian spice, candied peel, musk and peonies, the wine is full-bodied, textural and enveloping, with an abundance of opulent fruit that's the vintage's calling card, underpinned by velvety tannins and ripe acids.

It's just as powerful as this year's La Tâche but even more elegantly framed by filigree structure, concluding with an intensely sapid and penetratingly fragrant finish.

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and velvety, with a deep, concentrated but tight-knit core, its firm chassis of fine-grained, structuring tannins cloaked in succulent fruit, underpinned by juicy acids. The finish is long and reverberative. This is a stunning La Tâche in the making, but it is also one of the more reticent wines in the range and will demand some bottle age.",,RP 98
648,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Broader-shouldered and ampler than the Romanée-St-Vivant, the 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru unfurls in the glass with a lavish bouquet of cassis, dark plums, candied peel, potpourri, Asian spices, peonies and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and expansive, with considerable depth and dimension at the core, and a gourmand, almost fleshy profile that marries beautifully with its cool, precise fruit tones and its velvety structuring tannins. This is a superb Richerbourg that to my palate surpasses the 2015 rendition.",,RP 98
649,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2016 Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru is super, bursting from the glass with a kaleidoscopic bouquet of potpourri, red berries, cassis, peony and rose petal. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and fine-boned, with tangy acids, superb concentration and an ample chassis of powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long, fragrant finish. This is a Romanée-St-Vivant that exemplifies the intensity without the weight that distinguishes the Domaine's best wines, and it equals the fabulous 2015 rendition.",,RP 98
650,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Corton Grand Cru,"Surpassing the 2015 rendition, the 2016 Corton Grand Cru is the finest wine that the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti has produced to date from the holdings of Prince Florent de Mérode. Wafting from the glass with notes of cassis, currant leaf, raspberries and menthol, discretely framed by new wood, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and intense, gaining in depth and dimension as it sits in the glass, with tangy underpinning acids and powdery tannins, culminating in a long finish. Aubert de Villaine recounted that the Domaine replanted a third of Corton-Bressandes while also grafting over the Mérodes' young vines to their own massal selections of Pinot Fin. While this is built for four decade's evolution in the cellar, the balance and concentration are such that it could be drunk with pleasure in its youth.",,RP 98
651,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2009 La Tâche Grand Cru is still a decade away from the plenitude of maturity, but it's already a head-turning wine, soaring from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of rose petal, Asian spices, grilled meats, rock salt, espresso roast, rich soil tones, plums and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and richly structured around fine-grained chalky tannins, with a deep and multidimensional core and succulent underlying acids, concluding with a long, fragrant finish. This is an utterly classic La Tâche that ranks among the vintage's high points.",,RP 98
652,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's 1994 La Tâche Grand Cru does not transcend the limitations of this challenging vintage, offering up a rather pedestrian bouquet of red-black fruit and licorice, becoming more and more dominated by its lavish application of high-quality new oak as it sits in the glass and never revealing any of the aromatic drama of which La Tâche is capable. On the palate, the wine is chunky and foursquare, with bright acids and a certain tannic asperity that suggests this is unlikely to change in any critical respect in the foreseeable future.",,RP 98
653,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru is still predictably youthful, unfurling in the glass with aromas of crisp Anjou pear, buttered citrus, tangerine oil and a prominent framing of very classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and concentrated, both satiny and textural without being remotely unctuous, and underpinned by succulent, even tangy acids. At this stage, where the wine really shows its pedigree is in its extraordinarily long, oak-inflected finish. Given the vintage, one might have expected more ripeness and drama, but the domaine is picking its Montrachet a bit earlier these days, and that has done it no harm at all in 2015. It would be interesting to taste this wine alongside Ramonet's example, which is both more textural and less overtly oaky, but my sense is that the two are on the same qualitative level in their very different styles.",,RP 98
654,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is one of the pinnacles of this great red Burgundy vintage, opening in the glass to reveal a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, notes of raspberry and red plum mingling with rose petal, peony, blood orange and spice. On the palate, the wine is silky, medium to full-bodied and stunningly complete, its supremely elegant tannins entirely cloaked in pristinely delicate red fruit. Despite its incredible concentration and persistence, this Romanée-Conti is utterly weightless, and its effortless harmony and unremitting finish preclude any argument about its benchmark quality. Cropped at 22 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 10.",,RP 98
655,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2015 La Tâche Grand Cru is a young classic, soaring from the glass with an exotic and stunningly complex bouquet of dark berries, plums, hoisin, smoked duck, dark chocolate, licorice and Chinese five spice, with just a touch of rose hip on the upper register. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and authoritative, with more mid-palate depth than the Richebourg, its attack more textural and layered. The tannins here are fine grained but firm—swathed in an ample core of plummy, almost savory fruit—and the finish is long and scintillating. Cropped at 25 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 7 and 8.",,RP 98
656,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru is very good indeed, offering up a pure and surprisingly expressive nose of strawberry, dried rose, plum preserve, roast squab, raw cocoa and incipient rich soil tones, framed by some nutty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and rich, sweet fruit playing in counterpoint with sapid, savory nuance. This Richebourg is denser at the core and less expansive than the corresponding Romanée-St-Vivant, and though the grain of its tannins is similar, their impact is more assertive and muscular. Cropped at 24 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 8 and 9.",,RP 98
657,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti 2015 Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru was showing superbly from bottle, bursting from the glass with a dramatic and expressive bouquet of rose petal, violet, raspberry and spicy red cherry that has already digested its framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, expansive and supple, its frame of fine-grained tannins cloaked in a deep core of vibrant fruit and only asserting themselves on the long, penetrating finish. This is a superb Romanée-St-Vivant that nips on the heels of the fabulous Richebourg this year. Cropped at 26 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 9, 10 and 11.",,RP 98
658,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2015 Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru is more brooding and reserved than the Échézeaux, opening in the glass with notes of raspberry, plum preserve, currant leaf, blood orange, hints of the forest floor to come and, again, a rich framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with notable structural amplitude and a long, authoritative and firmly tannic finish. This is always a wine that takes a long time to show all its cards, and the 2015 is no exception, but the raw materials indicate that patience will bear dividends. Cropped at 30 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 11 and 12.",,RP 98
659,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"After the more restrained Corton, the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's 2015 Échézeaux Grand Cru bursts from the glass with a flamboyant bouquet of mulberry, black cherry, wood smoke and a lavish framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and intense, with a classically firm chassis of tannin and a lovely core of sappy, succulent fruit. This was the last of DRC's vineyards to be harvested, but despite its overtly ripe aromas and flavors, it retains superb acidity and focus and should amply reward cellaring. Cropped at 26 hectoliters per hectare and harvested September 12 and 14.",,RP 98
660,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1990 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti continues to cruise along, blossoming in the glass with a lavish bouquet of black cherry, blackberry, sous bois, dark spice and a touch of game. On the palate, the wine is ample and full-bodied, with a chassis of fine, melted tannins—though just a few rough edges poke out on the finish (a function of arrested phenolic maturity?)—enrobed in juicy, vibrant fruit that lingers through the long and penetrating finish. Bottle number 7492.",,RP 98
661,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"From a cold Burgundian cellar, the 1972 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti put in a very creditable showing in this vintage, especially as the 1970s were not particularly distinguished years at the Domaine. Aromas of macerated red fruits, dried rose petal, raw cocoa and savory bass notes precede a medium-full wine with melted tannins, a glossy core of cool fruit, tangy acids and a sapid, saline finish. In this era, DRC bottled barrel-by-barrel, and I’m guessing this bottle hailed from one of the good ones.",,RP 98
662,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was cropped at seven hectoliters per hectare, and it handles the sway of the barrel in superior fashion to that of the Echezeaux, at least at the moment. There is crisp blackberry and bilberry fruit, fine mineralité and a whiff of wild heather and drizzly moorland. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grained tannin. It is underpinned by crisp acidity, and here I discerned more red fruit vis-à-vis the Echézeaux, blessed with a tender but sustained and poised finish. This is classy, and I suspect this year, a step up from the Echézeaux.",,RP 98
663,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Echezeaux Grand Cru was cropped at just six hectoliters per hectare because of the frost, which equates to just 12 barrels. I felt that the new oak came a little more strongly through the aromatics and rather obstructed the terroir expression at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with quite conspicuous oak: firm tannins that encase dark berry fruit, a touch of orange rind and then a tang of black pepper on the finish. I await to see if this will subsume the oak during the remainder of its barrel maturation, whether when tasted it was the closing winter months accentuating the wood or a factor of such a low quantity of production. Let’s see.",,RP 98
664,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2008 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was served by Aubert de Villaine at the annual Musique et Vin festival at Clos de Vougeot, never having been commercially released by the domaine. Slightly deeper in color than I expected, it sported a distinct reductive nose that I thought worked quite well: vibrant and focused, just the right amount of struck-match scent without becoming overbearing. The palate is well balanced with a fine line of acidity, again quite reductive in style but with attractive orange peel and walnut notes toward the finish. Just a delicious, if ridiculously unobtainable, wine! Tasted June 2017.",,RP 98
665,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"I have never been a fan of the domaine's 1989s, and the 1989 La Tâche Grand Cru is no exception. Now showing some bricking on the rim, it has a rather herbaceous and earthy nose, a little muddled compared to superior vintages such as 1991. There is a subtle ferrous note, later a slight vegetal scent. The palate is rustic with furry tannin, moderate acidity and weight but clearly missing the finesse and the sophistication that you normally find on a La Tâche. It sort of ""stumbles"" over the finish line. It's not a bad Burgundy for the vintage, but it is not a great La Tâche. Tasted June 2017.",,RP 98
666,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru was picked on 19 September, cropped at 32.6 hectoliters per hectare and bottled on 25 and 26 April 2016. I remember tasting this from barrel, thinking how taciturn it was, before coaxing out those subtle tertiary aromas. Here it remains bashful once more, however, it soon begins to open and deliver the ethereal, mineral-infused red fruit. It is almost conservative compared to the more multi-faceted 2014 La Tâche. This is precise and detailed, not inclined to deliver aromatic ""thrills"" at such an early juncture. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, perfectly judged acidity, perhaps fuller in the mouth than the 2013 Romanée-Conti, with volume and grip towards the finish. Paradoxically, it is also a discrete wine, quite linear and maybe without the sustained persistence that elevates the La Tâche. You could sum up this Romanée-Conti in three words: precision, precision, precision. A total of 657 cases were produced, which is much above the average of 450, but do not expect the normal economic rules of supply and demand to apply. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
667,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru was picked on 20 and 21 September at 29.75 hectoliters per hectare. This has a gorgeous, flamboyant, vivacious bouquet with blossoming red cherries, crushed strawberry, less undergrowth scents compared to the showing in barrel, replaced by pressed rose petal notes. There is wonderful delineation and exuberance here. The palate is medium-bodied with a lively, spicy, white pepper-tinged entry, just a faint hint of black truffle tincturing the dark berry fruit. There is superb backbone and density here, a Richebourg delivering on its promise from barrel, plus it comes armed with an extraordinarily long aftertaste that evokes marine-like images, something wild and estuarine. While not as flattering as the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment, just wait ten years. 1,160 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
668,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2014 La Tâche Grand Cru was picked on 17, 18 and 20 September at 32 hectoliters per hectare, bottled between 1 and 25 April 2016. It has a quite startling bouquet: dark berry fruit, bay leaf, hints of jasmine tea and autumn leaves. It delivers multi-faceted aromatics, a mercurial bouquet, brown spices emerging with continued aeration in the glass. It is a tad more forward than I expected. The palate is medium-bodied with great structure and fine grip. This is a slightly more masculine La Tâche and replicating its performance in barrel, the fruit spectrum shimmies from red to black (incidentally, exactly as I observed when I tasted it in barrel). There is a lovely lift on the finish that leaves you with a piquant kiss on the cheek. This is wonderful. 1,929 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
669,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was picked on 21, 22 and 23 September cropped at 31.6 hectoliters per hectare. Now this has a distinctly earthy bouquet, one that leads you into the dark woods. Yes, there is plenty of vivacious red berry fruit, here augmented with something autumnal, brown leaves on an October morning, moss and tree bark. Then with continued aeration, these shift away and are replaced by pure floral aromas. The palate is very precise on the entry with a touch of orange rind and mandarin complementing the crushed strawberry and raspberry fruit; there is a touch of spiciness towards the finish that exerts a gentle, yet insistent grip à la Richebourg. The persistence here is very impressive and it just seems to blossom in the glass until you have utterly succumbed to its charms. 1,756 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
670,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on 23 and 24 September at 32.5 hectoliters per hectare. Slightly deeper in color compared to the 2014 Echézeaux, it is undeniably a tangible step up in intensity and complexity, offering disarming raspberry, crushed strawberry, and crushed limestone that almost verges on flintiness. It has beguiling purity and focus. The palate is medium-bodied with a noticeably grippy entry. It has a strong saline seam, structured but not a dense Grands Echézeaux. It gently fans out on the finish with pretty, mineral-soaked red fruit, although the aftertaste is not as prolonged as some of the greatest vintages I have tasted from this esteemed vineyard. Nevertheless, it remains a supremely gifted wine that will bestow two, possibly three decades of drinking pleasure. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
671,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on 24, 25 and 26 September at 27.8 hectoliters per hectare. It offers an expressive bouquet, more vivacious than the 2012 Echézeaux, with scents of black plum, raspberry preserve and subtle limestone aromas. It unfolds with confidence in the glass. The palate is surprisingly structured on the entry, perhaps with ambitions towards its elder brother, the Grands Echézeaux. There is a gentle, slightly leafy quality to this Grand Cru, perhaps more masculine and reserved than other vintages tasted just after bottling. The aftertaste feels long with a cheeky pinch of black pepper. Probably one of the most approachable 2014s from the domaine, and just as likely to be drunk too young! 1,443 cases produced.",,RP 98
672,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Grand Cru was picked on 16 September at 25 hectoliters per hectare. It has a beguiling bouquet with wonderful lift and transparency: morello cherry, crushed strawberry, a touch of orange blossom, aromas that are beautifully defined. The palate is well balanced with a little chalkiness on the entry. It is brimming with quite feisty tart red fruit, a little spicier than previous vintages. The finish is elegant and refined, not as complex as I suspect the 2015 Corton will eventually become, yet there is wonderful harmony and mineralité in situ. One of the more ""airy"" Cortons from the domaine. 483 cases produced. Tasted February 2017.",,RP 98
673,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The last time that I drank the 1990 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was at the domaine in 2010. Five years on it remains a lovely Richebourg. Clear and quite deep in color, the bouquet remains ""ethereal"" with crushed strawberries and pomegranate fruit intermixed with iron, black truffle and a touch of pain d'épices. It is understated at first ,but after 30 minutes it had manifested the sense of grandeur you expect from a Richebourg. The palate is beautifully balanced with great depth and volume. There is that hint of black truffle coming through once more, as well as sour cherries, a hint of blueberry and an almost viscous, decadent finish that not so much caresses the sense but gives it a good ""seeing to."" This is probably the best bottle that I have tasted, and it should have another 20-30 years of pleasure to give. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
674,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I have never been convinced by the performance of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti in this year and the 1989 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru did nothing but reinforce that view. Stalky and rather disjointed on the nose, the stem addition here seems to jar against the fruit rather than complement it. Rasping? The palate is medium-bodied, rustic and with a gritty texture. Masculine and firm in the mouth, it falls a long way short of the wines produced nowadays and the chewy finish feels coarse and attenuated. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
675,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 1978 La Tâche Grand Cru is admittedly a wine that I have always wanted to taste, just the stratospheric price tag prohibiting me from doing so...until now, thanks to the generosity of my host rather than me winning the lottery. My expectations were understandably sky high given the reputation, but I was not disappointed because it lived up to everything I hoped for. Mature in color with wide bricking on the rim, the nose is utterly bewitching with fragrant scents of orange peel, iron piping, damp undergrowth, wild mushroom and a hint of dried blood. It felt intense yet beautifully defined. The palate felt fully mature after 38 years, the tannins completely melted. While there is not the weight of the 1978 Romanée-Conti, there is a sense of presence and grandeur imbued by this La Tâche. The balance is perfect, the symmetry beguiling, and it gently fans out on the pure, caressing finish. It offers everything you could wish from a mature Pinot Noir, a hauntingly beautiful wine that I shall remember for a very long time. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
676,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 1976 La Tâche Grand Cru is a vintage that I have only encountered once before. This bottle replicated the first. It has a lovely, quite spicy bouquet with scents of warm bricks and peat, fine delineation although not as much fruit as say, the 1978 that I had tasted a few weeks previously (yeah...lucky sod). The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and sensual in texture with a fine bead of acidity. Granted, it is not a complex La Tâche and the growing season bestowed a gaminess that comes through a little more obviously than the previous bottle. Yet for the vintage this has lasted very well and though it will not improve, it should hold in there for another 6-8 years before gently fading. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
677,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1971 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru is a wine that I have tasted a handful of times; this a vintage where the wines excelled (not until 1978 was that the case again). Here the bottle was similar in color to previous encounters with quite a broad degradation. The bouquet is fresh and lively with that brambly red fruit, orange peel and wild heather (yes - I wrote exactly the same descriptors as last time without any previous recall!). The palate conveys wonderful energy, a purring motor here, poised and transparent. It gently unfolds—such a nuanced Grands Echézeaux that paradoxically leaves a deep impression. Outstanding. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 98
678,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1971 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was poured from magnum. It had a powerful, almost burly bouquet as you would expect from this vineyard—perhaps autumnal, brown leaves and a cold Sunday afternoon, touches of Earl Grey infused the dark berry fruit (darker than the 1971 Grands Echézeaux tasted alongside incidentally). The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity, hints of dried orange peel infusing the black and red fruit, all with impressive energy considering that this is now the same age as yours truly. Perhaps I found more breeding on the aforementioned Grands Echézeaux, and yet this is still a gorgeous mature Burgundy that will continue to give immense pleasure over the next decade for those privileged with the experience. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
679,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"This bottle of 1961 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru came directly from the domaine's cellars. While the 1961 vintage is not as revered as the 1962s from the domaine, the handful that I have tasted have all been outstanding. This was no different. It has a haunting bouquet with breathtaking delineation and purity. It is like inhaling an intoxicating perfume and you had to just pause and reflect upon its almost ineffable complexity. The bouquet...enveloped you. The palate displayed exquisite balance. No, not a powerful Romanée-Conti but the epitome of elegance and refinement without shortchanging you on presence and intensity. There is even a slight rusticity detected on the finish, a little coarseness to the texture, no doubt emblematic of the time, although you perceive that as simply part of its character. It is a truly wondrous wine. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 98
680,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1996 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru continues to be an absolutely delightful wine from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and puts to rest memories of a sub-par bottle tasted blind several years ago. Now two decades old, it retains a healthy color with little sign of ageing. The bouquet is fresh and vital, angular at first yet seeming to gain harmony with each swirl of the glass. It is not intense, but prioritizes clarity and tension over power. Dark berry fruit emerge first, briary and Vervain tea, an underlying mineralité eventually coming forth. The palate is very well balanced, quite linear and certainly not flamboyant or flattering. It makes you, the taster, work to seek out its nuances, its energy and refinement. Hints of black cherry intermingle with a marine-like undertow that governs that finish. It does not posses huge depth and I think Aubert de Villaine makes a more sophisticated wine nowadays, but it remains a joy. Tasted September 2016.",,RP 98
681,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2013 La Tâche Grand Cru was picked from the afternoon of October 7 and over the next two days at 18 hectoliters per hectare. It has a heavenly nose with exquisite mineral-rich red cherry, wild strawberry, blood orange and subtle woodland, damp autumn leaf and moss aromas that are extraordinarily complex. It seems to gain vigor and intensity with each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, a slightly suppler La Tâche compared to recent years, a wine with an athleticism. There is nothing wasted or superfluous here, a honed La Tâche that is all about tensile structure matched by perfect acidity and an incredibly complex, kaleidoscopic finish that seems so mercurial in the glass, initially offering red fruit then changing its mind and revealing darker and more tertiary notes. In a word: awesome. Production is 1,023 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
682,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru was picked in the afternoon of October 8 at a yield of 17.5 hectoliters per hectare. I remember this was taciturn in barrel vis-à-vis the La Tâche, which is commonly the case, however here it sprints from the blocks thanks to a life-affirming bouquet of red plum, wild strawberry, cold wet limestone and black truffle that segues into something almost girolles-like, even smoky. Like the 2013 La Tâche, it is very mercurial in the glass and to that end, I stretched my sample out for 10-15 minutes. The palate is medium-bodied and very harmonious on the entry. Filigree tannin frame this wine, perfect acidity lending freshness and tension, here a gradual build towards a delineated, almost edgy finish. It brought to the forefront of my mind an actor about to utter the first line of a play. Give it several years in bottle before you start throwing bouquets onto the stage, for the performance will be worth the wait. Production is 312 cases. Tasted February 2016. ",,RP 98
683,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru was harvested on the afternoon of October 9 and then the following day at just 16.5 hectoliters per hectare, the second lowest after the Echézeaux. It is clearly the elder brother of the 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant with intense dark cherry, black plum, tayberry and crushed violet aromas (the latter, perhaps a nod to the Romanée-Saint-Vivant). As with all the domaine's wines this year, it is beautifully defined with beguiling transparency. The palate is medium-bodied, but there is serious weight and presence here. It is struck through with sorbet-like freshness, hints of blood orange tincturing the vibrant red fruit, seguing into a finish with great conviction and confidence, a Richebourg self-aware though not preening about its status. This is a Richebourg to cellar for several years and to enjoy over the next 20 to 25 years (or more). Production is 551 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
684,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was picked on the afternoon of October 10 and then the following day, cropped at 17.5 hectoliters per hectare. The bouquet is adorable, so pure and comely, with shimmering red cherries, raspberry and orange blossom, a suggestion of cold flint imparting an enigmatic element—a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that is clearly going to bide its time. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin, impressive weight and almost a surfeit of freshness. There is tension from start to finish that effortlessly disguises the weight, the penetration on the sustained finish. What a wonderful wine from the domaine. Production is 847 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
685,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on the afternoon of October 6 and then the following morning, the yield delivering 21.5 hectoliters per hectare, higher than the Echézeaux. It has a vivid bouquet of Morello cherry, strawberry, crushed stone and just a touch of wilted rose petal, all beautifully defined and seeming to gain intensity in the glass. The palate is extremely well balanced and the acidity is well judged. There are earthy tones present, a hint of autumn woodland, a subtle but very attractive leafiness embroidered into the fruit. This is a very typical Grands Echézeaux, perhaps a little introspective compared to the more outgoing Echézeaux, but there is considerable length. Production is 782 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
686,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru was picked on October 12 and the following day (in the afternoon, if you want specifics!). Cropped at 15.5 hectoliters per hectare, the lowest of all the domaine's 2013s, it has a fragrant Morello cherry, crushed strawberry-scented bouquet that is precise and nicely focused, if lacking the horsepower of a more benevolent growing season. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp red cherry and strawberry fruit on the entry. Fresh and poised, I am impressed by the weight shown on the mid-palate, so much so that you might be deceived into mistaking it for the Grands Echézeaux or even the Richebourg, albeit on a less scale. There is just a dash of spice towards the finish as it gently fans out and leaves you satisfied. ""A quite ambitious Echézeaux in the making,"" I remarked out of barrel. I would not alter that view now that this lovely Echézeaux is in bottle. Production is 715 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
687,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton Grand Cru was picked on October 3 at an average yield of 19.5 hectoliters per hectare. It has a light blueberry and crushed strawberry-scented bouquet that does not quite possess the intensity of the 2013 Echézeaux. There is a hint of fresh fig that emerges with time in the glass. The palate is clean and fresh. There is something almost ""airy"" about this Le Corton, with pitch perfect acidity and perhaps more transparency than I have observed in earlier vintages. It does not boast great density and fruit concentration on the finish, and perhaps it is just deprived the substance that a more benevolent season would have bestowed. Nevertheless, it is a delicious, almost easy-drinking little ingénue of a Corton that will give much drinking pleasure over the next 12-15 years. Production is 461 cases. Tasted February 2016.",,RP 98
688,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2002 Romanée Saint Vivant from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti has a heavenly bouquet. It was served blind but the tangible stem addition betrayed the grower, particularly when it was later compared next to an Henri Jayer. The bouquet is very complex with red berries, tree bark, a touch of dried blood and smoke, but what is striking is the delineation. The palate is medium-bodied and as you would expect, extremely well balanced. There is plenty of sappy red fruit here suffused with sage and rosemary, a touch of spice enlivening a finish that has impressive density (so much so that it could pass as a Richebourg.) I was not the only person to notice how it became more more savory and ferrous in the glass, after 30 minutes suggesting a touch of Japanese tea (the proper, thickly textured type). Just wondrous. Tasted January 2016.",,RP 95
689,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is not a million miles away from the Richebourg in style, again with hints of damp earth and woodland, quite ethereal as it often is at this stage, becoming more ""airy"" as it opens in the glass. The palate is structured on the entry, a little fuller and broader than the La Tâche, almost less discrete (though that sounds too pejorative). The acidity drives this forward and there is great substance on the finish. It will be intriguing to see whether this Romanée-Conti will retain this chutzpah once in bottle.",,RP 95
690,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru has a more expressive, perhaps more floral bouquet compared to the Echézeaux at the moment. There is a mineral component here that is discretely stitched into these aromatics. The palate is medium-bodied, quite saline on the entry with a little more density than its 'little brother' -- he mouth tingling the sides long after it has departed. This appears to be a step up from the Echézeaux at this prenatal juncture, exuding the class of this great grand cru.",,RP 95
691,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a precise bouquet, perhaps not quite as generous as I have found other, riper vintages at this stage, with a mixture of red and black fruit as well as a hint of violet and Earl Grey tea. The palate is medium-bodied with quite rigid tannin on the entry. This is a cool, more reserved Echézeaux than I was expecting, quite structured but with very fine precision on the finish.",,RP 95
692,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2011 Corton Grand Cru from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti put in a similar showing as it did just after bottling earlier last year. It has less of the mushroom element than I recollect, adorned with pastille-like purity of red cherry and wild strawberry fruit, a slight ferrous note developing with time in the glass. The palate has developed a tad more roundness in the mouth in recent months, the tannins softened a little and it is consequently less masculine and more approachable. That said, as much as I enjoyed polishing off my glass, I would advise allowing this several years in bottle so that it can lose its puppy fat.",,RP 95
693,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"This is the second time that I have tasted the 2010 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru from bottle from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and it was a wine that prompted a table of mature Pinot aficionadoes to remark upon the joys of infanticide. This is just a fantastic wine from the domaine. The nose is heavenly with its exquisite delineation, the fruit maybe a touch darker and earthier than a couple of years ago -- yet still with subtle woodland/sous-bois aromas and a hint of morels. The palate is wonderfully defined, so fresh and precise with filigree tannin. Yet there is great backbone to this wine, a framework that imparts a sense of symmetry that is totally disarming. Of course, readers should afford this magnificent wine a decade in the cellar...unless by complete accident a corkscrew falls into the cork and twists around until the cork pops out. Then you will have to drink it.",,RP 95
694,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1991 Romanée Conti Grand Cru was tasted at the same private dinner in Beaune with the 1978 and the awry 1966. Whilst I was totally smitten by the 1978, this 1991 did not quite engage the senses as I thought it would, writing as a big fan of the 1991 vintage. The aromatics are mute at first and you get the sense that it is holding everything back despite being over 20 years old and my rigorous swirling of the glass. Red berries and subtle undergrowth scents emerge, bay leaf. The palate is structured and a little rigid at the moment, hints of white pepper emerging with time, dusky red berry fruit, quite structured and masculine. Strangely I had fonder memories of the La Tâche 1991, drunk twice earlier this year. I could not quite engage with this Romanée-Conti as I did with the 1978. Perhaps that was just its showing on the day? I hope I get the opportunity to find out. Tasted November 2015.",,RP 95
695,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1978 Romanée Conti Grand Cru is a wine that I thought I would never taste. This bottle was served at a private dinner in Beaune with Bertrand de Villaine present. The bottom line is -- it delivered. With a thin tawny rim it shows its age, but the bouquet is truly transcendental, a mixture of red and black fruit such as wild strawberries and raspberry, and a hint of pomegranate all beautifully defined. With aeration it begins to offer more secondary aromas, such as brown sugar and a scent of a Tuscan delicatessen. The palate lives up to expectations with very fine tannins, fresh and tensile with a veneer of shimmering dark plum and raspberry fruit that soon gives way to more meaty notes, almost ferrous towards the finish. It has almost unbearable finesse. Is it a perfect wine? Almost. As much as I could, I drank this, as it is just a sublime and evocative Pinot Noir. Tasted November 2015.",,RP 95
696,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 1958 Romanée Conti Grand Cru was served blind at a dinner in London. As provenance is such an issue, this came from an impeccable source, namely the sale of Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni's cellar that was sold through Christies (see Michael Broadbent's ""Vintage Wine"" tome). What a pleasant surprise, especially given the vintage. Mature with a chestnut core, the bouquet has a ferrous tinge, and it is quite stately with a hint of undergrowth and chestnut that infuse that still bright red berry fruit. It is not potent in any shape ot form, but there is marvelous delineation and that runs through onto the palate. There are fine tannins here, a slightly citric edge that infuses the tart red fruit. It is not complex, but there is still a brightness and joie-de-vivre about this Romanée-Conti, with hints of bay leaf and minerals on the aftertaste. This is just wonderful. Tasted October 2015.",,RP 95
697,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Oh yes. Oh yes, yes, yes. This 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is a bit like a great athlete, one who really shows its class against stiff opposition, here in the form of 18 other Richebourg! It follows the same thread as the imperial 1999 La Tâche. It has been blessed with a sensational nose that boasts quite astonishing delineation and precision, fabulous mineralité. The aromatics are far more detailed and enthralling than the 2007 tasted alongside. The palate is beautifully structured, virtually symmetrical with filigree tannin, with a gentle crescendo in the mouth towards an effervescent finish with hints of orange peel. Simply effortless. ",,RP 95
698,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1995 Richebourg Grand Cru is a wine that I have not tasted for a few years, but it did not enthrall like the 1999 or have the easy-going charm of the 2007 Richebourg. There is some maturity showing on the brick-ish rim. The nose is forward and earthy with sage, dried orange peel and a touch of mint, though it feels a little more diffuse that I was expecting. The palate is balanced and quite savory, perhaps more than I was expecting. It is an enjoyable Richebourg, but it does not have the stamp of authority. I suspect there are better bottles than this, ergo my plus-sign next to a somewhat parsimonious score. ",,RP 95
699,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2003 Grands Echézeaux from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti impressed its audience and duped everyone from thinking it heralded from the 2003 vintage. It has a potent ripe strawberry, mulberry and dried rose petal nose that actually had to throw off a little reduction upon first acquaintance. The palate is medium-bodied with layers of sappy red berry fruit. The initial tightness gradually dissipates to reveal quite a ""stocky"" Grands Echézeaux with good length, if not the detail of a top vintage from this vineyard.",,RP 95
700,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. It was initially difficult to choose between the 1999 and 2002 La Tâche, but in the end the former just ascended to the stratosphere, while the latter simply cruised, albeit at a very high altitude. Now at 13 years of age, there is just a slight bricking on the rim. It feels a little more forward than the 1999–a stylish and personality-driven bouquet with predominantly red berry fruit interlaced with warm bricks and undergrowth (much more so of the latter compared to the 1999). The palate is beautifully balanced with exquisite tannin, perfect acidity and an effortless, you might say easygoing personality. That is deceptive because it is a complex and utterly harmonious La Tâche that is the epitome of elegance. Unlike the 1999, I would broach this now with an hour's decanting. Wonderful. ",,RP 95
701,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Grands Echézeaux 2000 is a cerebral Burgundy, not quite as convincing as it was three years ago, but still a great wine. Here it has a vibrant red berry, stony bouquet that is reserved at first, but opens nicely with limestone and sea-spray scents emerging with time. It has a quite brilliant balance on the palate–not a powerful Grands Echézeaux but complex, with hints of black olive and chlorophyll emerging toward the finish that gently fans out and becomes a little spicier as it aerates. Superb.",,RP 95
702,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Echézeaux 2000 from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti won the hearts of everyone around the table–one of those wines that you just cannot help falling for. It has a dark garnet core with thin bricking on the rim. The nose is actually reminiscent of a fine Musigny from de Vogüé, a little introverted at first but it's just kidding with you and bursts open with infectious joie de vivre. The palate is medium-bodied, quite linear at first with superb tension and energy. No, it is not as complex as the Grands Echézeaux 2000 but that Loire-like, sappy finish is beguiling. Drink now and enjoy over the next 15 years. Given the growing season this performs way above expectations.",,RP 95
703,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aubert de Villaine mentioned that this was only the second time that this fabled wine had been tasted outside the domaine. The Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru 2000 has a lucid straw colour. The nose is irresistible with popcorn and almond, hints of hazelnut, almost Meursault-like in style and full of energy. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine seam of acidity, touches of nougat and marzipan lending it an almost Sonoma-like allure with a long, candied finish. Just delicious–no more, no less.",,RP 95
704,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Having not tasted the La Tâche 1999 since it had been bottled, I was intrigued to see how it was developing. Monumentally, is the correct answer. First and foremost this is a seriously long-term La Tâche that is maturing at a glacial pace. Indeed, I left most in my glass and waited for it to open. An hour later and it was firing on all cylinders. It is blessed with an incredibly intense, powerful nose that loses its broodiness with aeration and eventually unveils a crystalline set of mineral-soaked aromatics that sport a decadent, almost exotic floral note–wilted violets and potpourri. The palate has a quite astonishing structure, but it is more the symmetry that makes this one of the greatest vintages of recent years. It unfolds with daring passion to reveal layers of plush but focused dark plum and cassis fruit that just seem to flow and flow on the never-ending finish. It is a multifaceted, multidimensional masterpiece that really needs another decade in bottle.",,RP 95
705,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. I tasted the La Tâche 1991 twice within 24 hours: the first ex-domaine and the second purchased from auction in Switzerland, both with Aubert de Villaine present. The former was the best, right? Wrong. It was actually the second that clearly delivered, the ex-domaine example so brutally backward that it was more impressive than a wine to love. That was not the case with the second. The nose was unapologetically ethereal with mineral-laden black fruit with hints of cold wet limestone and peaty moorland on a gloomy winter's day. The precision is quite astonishing. The palate is perfectly balanced as it glides effortlessly across the mouth, intense rather than powerful, a gentle crescendo that fans out gracefully on the finish. I have always had faith in the 1991 La Tâche and now it is coming out of the shadow of the 1990 and proving once and for all, which wine is the greater. ",,RP 95
706,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg 1991 is showing just the first signs of bricking on the rim. It is more savoury than I expected with subtle gamey notes infusing the dense black fruit and a touch of leather in the background. The palate is robust and powerful at first, clearly very well balanced and then easing back with aeration as it becomes ever more elegant and slightly ferrous. There are plenty of tart red fruit toward the finish and when leaving it in my glass I noticed that the ferrous tincture on the palate begins to evolve on the nose. This Richebourg is cruising, and should continue to give pleasure over the next decade or two. Sublime.",,RP 95
707,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1990 sports a deep garnet core with brick rim. The palate is obviously from a relatively warm Burgundy vintage and delivers a surfeit of ripe, juicy and powerful red fruit infused with black truffle, leather and mint, with time a touch of rose petals. It gains more and more delineation with time, though never quite achieves the clinical precision of the 1991. The palate is full-bodied and for La Tâche, quite sinewy with layers of intense, rounded, svelte red berry fruit with just a touch of piquancy. It has an enormous structure and undeniable presence, yet this bottle could not hold a torch to either the 1991 or the 1999 La Tâche. Aubert de Villaine himself commented that he prefers the 1991 La Tâche to the 1990 and I concur. This is a great La Tâche but now with 25-years on the clock, one wonders whether it is past its peak?",,RP 95
708,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Having only encountered the La Tâche 1985 once from magnum, I was intrigued to see how it shows from bottle. To be honest, this did not live up to the billing and as far as anyone could tell (including Aubert de Villaine) there was nothing wrong with it. First, it looks far more mature than the aforementioned magnum from 2011. There are plenty of dried herbs and surprisingly (for such a precocious vintage) plenty of leafy red berry fruit that just lack the presence of the 1991 or the precision of the 1980. The palate is medium-bodied with a smooth texture. It is nicely balanced, but I was not the only one to remark on a lack of depth here, almost a predictable finish that does not seem to go anywhere despite allowing it to open in my glass. As a Burgundy 1985 it is satisfactory, but if I were paying the market price then I might defer. I wonder whether bottles are on the slippery slope and magnums holding up strong?",,RP 95
709,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The first thing to say is that this bottle of La Tâche 1974 was better than the 1972! It shows a little more clarity on the nose with pleasant scents of light cherries, leather, fennel and brown sugar. The palate is simple, rather monochromatic with jasmine tea on the tapered finish. This is just holding on by its fingernails. Drink up. ",,RP 95
710,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. This bottle of La Tâche 1972 showed poorly, even when compared to other infamously difficult coeval vintages. Firstly it is cloudy–always a bad omen. The nose offers smudged brown sugar and cola scents with noticeable madeirization. The palate is actually better with creditable depth, but it seems to be very chaptalized and feels short and oxidized on the finish. This has little pleasure left.",,RP 95
711,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. I wanted to like the La Tâche 1970 more than I could. Pale in color with a wide brick rim, the nose is rather muffled and mushroom-like with oxtail and wilted flowers. The palate is disappointing after what was a decent bouquet, a little hollow and disjointed although it possesses some depth on the rustic finish. It feels as if it is drying up. Opt for the vintages either side.",,RP 95
712,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1969 provided a fitting end for what was a great run of vintage throughout the decade. Now at 45 years old it unashamedly sports a mature, brickish hue. The nose does not quite contain the untrameled exuberance of the 1964 or 1966, but there is a sense of elegance and refinement in situ. The palate is well balanced, slightly rustic in style with chewier tannins than other vintages. There is clearly good backbone here with spice, tangy marmalade and white pepper on the finish that is just missing a little precision. I suspect this was superior 10 to 15 years ago and is now in gentle decline. However, unlike others this is still worth seeking out. ",,RP 95
713,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1966 is one of those wines were composing a tasting note seems futile. How can you express such a wine in words? Well, I will try. It must be considered one of the greatest La Tâche of all time. Typically of this vineyard it is a mercurial Pinot Noir that is deceptively simple upon first acquaintance. Then you notice its unbelievable delineation as scents of dark fruit, sous bois, cigar box and an exotic hint of star anise gently unfold. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins and nigh perfect acidity. There is such brightness and vigor in the 1966, allied with a sense of authority. Over time it gains precocity and there is a daring note of cough candy surfacing unexpectedly on the finish after ten minutes. This is an astonishing La Tâche that flirts with perfection.",,RP 95
714,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"Firstly, it should be said that a mischievous Aubert de Villaine served the Romanée-Conti 1965 blind. A couple of people guessed correctly, though I suspect they were hedging their bets on an anniversary vintage rather than the quality of the wine. The long and short of it is, the 1965 is miles better than it has any right to be given that this was reputedly one of the worst growing seasons ever. It is clear in colour, faded with a tuile rim. The nose is quite complex–not intense, but defined, with a hint of camphor complementing those decayed autumn leaves. The aromatics decline, but only after 15 to 20 minutes. The palate is medium-bodied, very well balanced with surprising presence of a wine 50 years old. The tannins feel a little rustic and it tapers dramatically toward the finish, but for a short while this is actually very enjoyable. I'll probably never drink it again–but what an experience.",,RP 95
715,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Given the performance of the Romanée-Conti 1965 the previous evening, surely everyone attending was privately speculating whether the La Tâche 1965 could defy form with such daring-do. The answer is ""non,"" but don't dismiss it entirely. Mature with a brick core and tawny-colored rim, it has a slightly tawdry, singed-leather nose that is diffuse and relinquished all its fruit years ago. But the palate is better with vestiges of freshness, notes of soy and brown sugar (chaptalization?) with a simple but pretty finish that is like watching a flame being snuffed out between your fingers. ",,RP 95
716,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1964 is one of those heaven-sent wines that you instantly know you might never drink again. This bottle clearly attested to what was a vintage studded with great wines from the domaine. First, there is that almost refulgent color, beaming at you from the glass. It seems more youthful than many of the subpar wines from the 1970s. The nose is divine: tart red fruit, briary, rose petal and Earl Grey tea all brilliantly defined. The palate is fresh and energetic–a 50-year old wine that has retained incredible tension and animation, while the finish has a pastille-like purity and real sucrose intensity. This is a quite brilliant wine from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. ",,RP 95
717,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. It is rare to find wines from this vintage nowadays. The La Tâche 1957 has a rather bleak and lifeless nose. I don't find anything wrong with this bottle except that I am probably drinking it three decades past its best. It is short and hard, the fruit having scarpered long ago. This is past its best.",,RP 95
718,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"This note for the La Tâche 1953 comes from a private dinner held at La Trompette in September 2014 rather than the bottle at the La Tâche vertical that did not quite have the same freshness. The provenance for the first bottle was impeccable, coming from Ronald Avery's cellar in Bristol having never been moved. It has an extremely complex bouquet with vestiges of decayed red fruit mixed with black truffle, tobacco and even a touch of garrigue. The palate is beautifully balanced with a crisp line of acidity. There is a touch of Earl Grey tea that is a commonality with the Romanée-Conti '53 and it concludes with a mellow, harmonious finish that has an autumnal air. What a graceful La Tâche.",,RP 95
719,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanée-Conti 1953 was the second vintage after the vineyard was replanted in 1945, so one must remember that the vines were just seven years old (assuming that the ground was not left fallow.) Mature in color with pale brick rim, it has a clean and well defined bouquet that if I am being truly honest, is missing the vigor that you might expect. It suggests that it might have been pretty in the past, but it is too ephemeral for my liking. I prefer the palate that is precise and balanced, elegiac with autumn leaves, tobacco and dried flowers. Over five minutes it gently builds in the mouth and meanwhile, the aromatics develop fireside hearth scents and gain intensity. I would drink any bottles in the near future and I suspect that vintages such as 1955 or 1959 will have more to offer in their dotage. That said, Aubert de Villaine intimated that he had encountered better bottles in the past, hence the plus sign accompanying my score.",,RP 95
720,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. The La Tâche 1952 is one of the better wines of the decade, one of the pleasant surprises. Clearly deeper in color than the 1950, it has lovely definition on the nose with vestiges of decayed, leafy red berry fruit, dried herbs, rose petals and lavender. With aeration it loses with its femininity and becomes earthier with a whiff of the old Lapsong Souchang. The palate is nicely structured and masculine–the remnants of rustic tannins firm and rendering this almost Bordeaux-like in style. There is a touch of dryness on the finish, but otherwise this is a very pleasurable La Tâche that continues to give pleasure, albeit in a more austere style than the 1953. ",,RP 95

The La Tâche 1950, not the greatest of Burgundy vintages, has a fully mature appearance–brick core with a tawny rim. All it needs is a pension book to go with it. The nose is actually not that bad: light and quite dusty and leathery with just a touch of molasses. The palate is distinctly leafy and herbaceous, not a million miles away from a Clos de Lambrays 1950 tasted just a few weeks earlier.

722,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Tasted at the La Tâche vertical at The Square. Unlike the 1937, the La Tâche 1943 is a war veteran that is still offering some pleasure. It is pale in color–understandable considering its age. The nose comes together nicely–frail at first but with pleasant damp earthy notes and some freshness. The palate is medium-bodied and balanced with bitter cherry, a touch of sourness creeping in, but a brisk light citric note on the linear finish. Not a bad Pinot Noir for a 72-year old and just emitting its last vestiges of sensory pleasure. It deserves a salute.",,RP 95

The 2012 Romanée-Conti is one of the most spellbinding that I have tasted since I began 17 years ago. The bouquet is quite astonishing with brilliant delineation and focus, an almost disorientating sense of mineralité that soars from the glass and leaves you speechless. The palate is perfectly proportioned with a sensational line of acidity, brimming over with energy and frisson. This flirts with perfection and you know, one day it might actually achieve it. Just 350 cases produced.",,RP 95

It is blessed with one of those aromatic profiles that stops you in your tracks, in some ways stops time itself. There is an intensity and drive here, a mixture of red and black fruit, autumn leaves and wet limestone and later, roof tiles on a hot July afternoon. The palate is medium-bodied and nigh perfectly balanced. The tannins are filigree, the fruit extremely pure with an intense mineralité on the finish. There is an effortless quality about this La Tâche and yet is just clams up on the finish, does not quite deliver that knockout blow that so many other vintages have given.

726,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg 2012 was picked September 27-28 at just 19 hectoliters per hectare, one of the lowest yields in this vintage. This has a serious bouquet, reserved at first, more earth than air. Unusual for this cuvee, there is a sense of exoticism here, a Richebourg daring to show a bit of ankle. Blackberry pastille intermingle with wilted violets, and there is a touch of warmth that belies the precocity of the growing season. Leaving it aside for 10 minutes, there are hints of Provençal herbs, broom and even fennel. The palate is medium-bodied and the first thing that strikes you is its backbone. Well, this is Richebourg after all. But there is an arching structure to this wine that is disguised by the silkiness of its texture, plus an almost citrus freshness and brightness on the finish.

There is a wondrous, ethereal purity to this 2012, a little more sumptuous than I recall it from barrel, with kirsch and freshly picked strawberries. As it opens, it gains more and more sensuality. The palate is rounded, almost curvaceous in the mouth, clearly more concentrated than the 2011 with a sense of authority and purpose, a bit of daring-do on the long finish. It leaves a slightly ferrous residue on the aftertaste, completing what is a marvelous and sensual Grand Cru. 1,148 cases produced.",,RP 95

Compared to the Echézeaux the nose is more demure, perhaps more refined, does not feel the urge to ""put it all out"" as it were. Reticent is the word - yet the precision and delineation is undeniable. The palate is medium-bodied with very supple tannin, here a mixture of red and black fruit, a little broodier and more introspective than its ""cousin"" but with greater persistence in the mouth. It unfurls on the finish: hints of dry tobacco and cedar, leaving you with the impression of a ""masculine"" Grands Echézeaux, one built for the long haul. 987 cases produced.",,RP 95
729,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2012 Corton Grand Cru was cropped at 11 hectoliters per hectare on September 21. Clear, almost pale in color, the nose exudes that term often appropriated to Burgundy: transparency. The aromatics gradually unfold with light strawberry and red cherry scents, just a hint of sous bois in the background. The palate is crisp on the entry with tart cherries, a fine line of acidity and hints of brown sugar interwoven through the finish that fans out gently. It feels a little foursquare, a ""correct"" Corton that is perhaps letting the fellow Grand Crus take the limelight. But it will give pleasure over the next 10 to 12 years, and though it might not represent the best Corton since the domaine took over the parcels in 2009, it is perhaps the one that slots in perfectly with the other wines. Just 242 cases produced this year.",,RP 95
730,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I adored the 2012 Echézeaux Grand Cru from barrel and I adore it from bottle. Picked on September 29-30  at 22 hectoliters per hectare, those explosive aromatics from barrel are replicated here with bright red cherries, kirsch and rose petals, all beautifully defined and imbued with a sense of exuberance. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe tannin, a dash of white pepper on the tip of the tongue and a beautifully poised, elegant finish. This is an Echézeaux determined to be above its station. Wonderful. 1,057 cases produced.",,RP 95
731,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc,"Bought from a list off a small bistro in the backwaters of Burgundy, the 2007 Hautes Côtes de Nuits Blanc, from no less than Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, is one of those fabled wines that few have tasted. My own experience extends to just a couple of encounters of the 2004 a few years ago. I have ask Aubert exactly where it is made, but all I know is that it comes from vines from around the Abbé St Vincent and it says that it was bottled at the domaine, proceeds going to restoration of the abbey. It had an endearing honeycomb and buttered toast bouquet, simple but well defined, indicative of a wine that is probably fully mature. There was just a touch of oxidation on the palate, but otherwise it was surprisingly rich, slightly viscous in texture with walnut, smoke and dried honey on the finish that bore faint semblance to a vin de paille! Readers should note before they go scavenging the bistros, this was perhaps the last bottle from their stock.",,RP 95
732,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I was quietly blown away by the sheer quality of this bottle of 1979 Echézeaux from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. It has an indescribably elegant and refined bouquet that has the depth one would have expected from de Villaine's Richebourg, for example. There are copious dark berry fruit mixed with black truffles and girolle, undergrowth scents developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin. There is plenty of depth and dimension to this grand cru, with real precision on the finish. A quite magical example of the supposed ""lowliest"" grand cru from the domaine in a lowly vintage. I'll take this any day!",,RP 95
733,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"As usual, the 2013 Romanée-Conti Grand Cru is more reticent on the nose compared to La Tâche at this point. As if fooling with you, it begins to unfurl with crystalline purity: Morello cherries and wild strawberry, wet limestone and wilted rose petals developing over time. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, stunning balance and a feminine, winsome finish that goes on for a over a minute. Perhaps this is more nuanced than the La Tâche, but does not quite have the same dimension and depth. We’ll see.",,RP 95
734,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru is probably more expressive than the Echézeaux on the nose with heightened delineation. Here there is wonderful precision and penetration. A second barrel showed a more floral character, the fruit slightly redder than the first. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins. This is just full of energy percolating through the dark berry, bergamot and bilberry fruit, yet there is a firm grip on the masculine finish, the second barrel a touch suppler and pastille-like. This is an aristocractic Grands Echézeaux in the making.",,RP 95
735,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a pure bouquet with minerally blackberry and raspberry scents, plus a light marine influence. The palate is surprisingly concentrated considering the growing season, thanks to it being the last vineyard picked on October 12 and the super-low yields of 16 hectoliters per hectare. It is endowed with impressive weight matched with a fine thread of acidity. There is a gentle grip in the mouth, but with the volume you might expect in a Richebourg on the finish. This is very promising - a quite ambitious Echézeaux in the making.",,RP 95
736,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"What few ‘66s from DRC I have tasted have all been utterly sublime and this 1966 Romanée St Vivant is no exception. Served blind, from first sniff it was clear that we were in the company of a very serious, mature Pinot Noir. The bouquet is utterly divine with incredibly detailed scents of tart red cherry, soy, orange peel and minerals, the true essence of that abstract “pinoté."" The palate is perfectly balanced, the silver thread of acidity lending it tension and poise. Yet there is also an abiding sense of effortlessness, as if this wine has to do little to entrance, with just a lovely hint of salinity on the aftertaste. One of the finest wines I will taste this year. Stellar!",,RP 95
737,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Montrachet was picked on 6 September at a respectable 37.1hl/ha. Lucid in colour, perhaps a little deeper than expected, it has a multi-faceted nose that you have to monitor over one hour. Hints of almond and butterscotch emerge at first, then salted caramel, pralines and peach skin. It is mercurial and utterly alluring. The palate is intense on the entry and immediately expresses a sense of vitality and tension. This Montrachet is suffused with great weight in the mouth with subtle touches of orange peel, almond and hazelnut that ebb with time. It mellows in the glass but never dispensing with one iota of tension, yet seeming if anything to gain in volume. This epitomizes great Montrachet. 265 cases produced. Drink 2016-2030+. ",,RP 95
738,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanee-Conti was picked on 6 September at 26.83hl/ha. As usual, the Romanee-Conti is reticent at first, as if the wine is checking you out before deciding whether you are worthy. It then unfurls to reveal a precise, exquisitely focused bouquet with crushed strawberry, flint and smoke. The palate is devastatingly smooth on the entry. The tannins are lace-like, the acidity perfectly judged and it gently crescendos in the mouth towards a seductive poised finish that lingers incredibly long. This is a master-class in ‘less being more’: a consummate Romanee-Conti for mid- rather than long-term cellaring. 473 cases produced. Drink 2017-2035+",,RP 96
739,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The La Tache 2011, picked on 5 and 6 September at 27.49hl/ha, has a wonderful bouquet that is quintessential La Tache: very complete and harmonious, beautifully delineated, succinct at first then with aeration, blossoming with brambly red berries, apple blossom, minerals and a touch of sous-bois. The palate is medium-bodied with immense purity and delicacy on the entry. This La Tache is extremely focused, velvety smooth in the mouth and although not as complex as the 2010, it has a beguiling femininity that will seduce at ten paces. It is extremely long in the mouth but politely does not outstay its welcome. Divine. 1,514 cases produced. Drink 2017-2040. ",,RP 96
740,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2011 Richebourg was picked on 7 and 8 September at 28.36hl/ha. It has a very pure bouquet, a mixture of blackberry, raspberry leaf, freshly tilled meadow and a touch of cold stone. It is not a powerful bouquet, but delineated and very focused. The palate is not dissimilar to the Grands Echezeaux on the entry: linear and poised with crisp brambly red fruit. But it swerves another way mid-through, developing a wonderful candied core of strawberry and Morello and a caressing finish sending ripples of pleasure across the senses. In many ways it is a self-effacing Richebourg with charm and candour, but I Richebourg that I suspect may be deceptively long lived. The Richebourg 2011 is a fair prince rather than a grand king. 931 cases produced. Drink 2018-2035. ",,RP 96
741,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Romanee-Saint-Vivant was picked on 8 and 9 September at 24.7hl/ha. Now this has a very interesting bouquet, quite distinct from the Richebourg and the Grands Echezeaux. It is much more exuberant and lifted, very perfumed with fresh strawberry, red cherries, dried rose petals and a touch of quince. This is so lively and vivacious, as if it borrowed some of the succulence from the 2009 vintage. The palate is quite precocious on the entry, the mouth instantaneously tingling with glee. There is a beautiful crescendo before fanning out towards its silky caressing finish. There is something playful and joyous about this Romanee-Saint-Vivant, carefree and alluring, a wine to be enjoyed as much as respected. 1,164 cases produced. Drink 2016-2035.",,RP 96
742,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Grands Echezeaux 2011 was picked on 9 and 10 September at 25.33hl/ha. There is certainly more intensity and fruitiness on the nose compared to the Echezeaux. The aromatics here feel fuller, rounder and more harmonious that its sibling. As the wine remains in the glass there are subtle cassis notes that begin to emerge accompanied by over-ripe oranges. The palate is well balanced and fresh on the entry, with slightly powdery tannins. It is very harmonious with well-judged acidity and compared to the Echezeaux there is more weight and corpulence to counterbalance the strict structure. It gently builds, never losing its head mind you, towards a lightly spiced finish that fans out beautifully. This is a very accomplished rather than spectacular Grands Echezeaux. 923 cases produced. Drink 2017-2030",,RP 96
743,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"Picked on 10 and 11 September at 22.04hl/ha, the Echezeaux Grand Cru has a delicate, quite feminine bouquet with scents of fresh strawberry, undergrowth and just a hint of dry tobacco. It opens nicely with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly brusque entry. The tannins are quite pointed here, creating a more angular Echezeaux compared to the 2011, whilst it needs to develop just a little more flesh and weight towards the back end that feels a little brittle and attenuated at the moment. Still, there is a fine saline, almost nori seaweed tang on the aftertaste – a nice twist in the tail. 1,030 cases produced. Drink now-2027",,RP 96
744,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"My first encounter with the 1991 Grand Echezeaux was a very positive one. It has a heaven-sent bouquet with quite brilliant delineation that really shows off the quality of the terroir – just pure unfettered Pinote. The palate is medium-bodied, supple at first but with admirable concentration: ebullient and vivacious red cherries intermingling with raspberry and a slight ferrous note. Good structure, as usual, with a well-knit and very focused finish that lingers gloriously in the mouth. Bon vin! Tasted November 2013.

745,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1966 Echezeaux Grand Cru is everything a Burgundy-lover could wish for. It has an open, expressive, delineated bouquet with dried rose petals and bergamot, hints of orange rind in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with bewitching balance and focus, perfectly pitched acidity and an elegant, feminine and graceful finish that leaves the mouth tingling. Weightless and yet intense, you yearn for another sip. This constitutes one of the finest mature DRC wines that I have tasted. Tasted November 2013.

746,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Tasted at The Sampler as part of their icon series of wines, the 1955 Richebourg Grand Cru is a pleasant surprise. The color is commensurate with its age, with broad bricking at the rim, its pallid hue belying a surprisingly vivacious bouquet with wild hedgerow, dried orange rind and rusty nails. Leaving it to open for a couple of minutes there is an unexpected minty scent. The palate is light, but balanced, with a smooth, harmonious entry. Still fresh and yet elegiac, the frayed finish is tender and a little hard, having lost its Richebourg robustness many moons ago. But there is something beguiling about this wine and I suspect a perfect bottle would be quite astonishing. Drink now. Tasted November 2013.

Deep in color, it has a respectable bouquet given its age with well-defined, tertiary red-berry fruit that is not complex or profound, but fresh and delightful. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity, crisp tannins, vestiges of wild strawberry and raspberry that lead to a composed, understated finish that leaves you with a smile plastered on your face. No, it is not the greatest Richebourg I have ever tasted from the domaine, but there is something magical about this war veteran. Tasted November 2013.

748,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1999 Romanee-St-Vivant initially has its nose put out of joint by the precocious 1999 Echezeaux, but allowing the wine to unfold over 30 to 40 minutes, it shows its true breeding. Returning after ten minutes, the nose positively explodes from the glass with a sorbet-like purity – hints of wild strawberry, cassis and a little blueberry – a piercing intensity that is wondrous to behold. The palate is medium-bodied and does not have the volume of the 1999 Echezeaux, but there is superior clarity and focus, the tannins clearly fine and the finish shimmering with tension and femininity. This is just a beautiful wine that will only get better. Drink 2016-2030.",,RP 96
749,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I was intrigued to see how the 1999 Echezeaux would be performing at 14 years of age since I have not tasted it since just after bottling. It has a very classy nose of dark cherry fruit, quite exotic for one of Aubert de Villaine’s wines, with hints of blood orange and even peach skin infusing the opulent aromatic profile. The palate is well-balanced and tightly knit, though it is clear that the RSV 1999 alongside was born with a higher level of delineation and clarity. Still, you have to admire the brio and hubris of this Echezeaux, and its youthful zeal suggests it will age over three decades without too much sweat. Delicious. Drink 2015-2030.",,RP 96
750,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"It has been several years since I last tasted this vintage of Aubert de Villaine’s Richebourg. This bottle has a pretty, generous bouquet with small dark cherries, iodine and raspberry preserve, the mineral component only becoming apparent with time in the glass. The palate is structured, more masculine than the nose suggests, supple and pure with a cohesive, rather sinewy finish. This is not a flamboyant Richebourg: more strict and unyielding, so I would give it another three or four years in the cellar. Tasted May 2013.",,RP 96
751,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"Following a Chambertin ’72 from Rousseau is not easy, but I was not the only person amazed by the precocity of the Grands Echezeaux ’79. The vivacious nose is entrancing with tart red cherries, red currant and violets that seem half their age. It offers brilliant delineation considering its age, a bouquet with unbridled vivacity and joie de vivre. The palate is supremely well-balanced with an almost fructose-like entry – a feminine, pretty, pure Grands Echezeaux that puts profundity to one side and just wants to keep giving out pleasure. There is a sense of symmetry towards the crystalline finish that is a wonder to behold. This is a real surprise and moreover, you could imagine this bottle lasting another 20 years with ease.

Romanee-Conti can be an elusive, intensely cerebral wine, but not in 2009. Floral notes add lift on the vivid, kaleidoscopic finish. Today the Romanee-Conti is all about breathtaking exuberance and richness. This is a breathtaking bottle. Anticipated maturity: 2029-2059.  

Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s 2009s have turned out just as brilliantly as I had hoped. The wines reflect the signature qualities of the year, but never lose their essential classicism. Long-time DRC fans know the domaine bottles in six-barrel lots, which naturally introduces a level of bottle variation that is not found in most other wines. I hope the massive amount of information that has recently come to light regarding counterfeit wines and their proliferation might be the catalyst for the domaine to consider bottling their wines in one homogenous lot, as is common for the vast majority of high-quality wines throughout the world. Once the domaine’s wines mature in 20-30 years it will be impossible to tell the difference between ‘normal’ bottle variation, poorly stored bottles and very good fakes. Certainly consumers who are willing and able to pay the prices these wines fetch are at the very least deserving of a consistent product.

The 2010 that most greatly exceeds its appellation and historical level of quality is the Echezeaux. I also tasted the 2010 Vosne-Romanee Cuvee Duvault-Blochet but the domaine had not yet decided if the wine would be released. I will report on the 2009s in our April issue.

761,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"It’s fascinating to taste the 2010 Romanee-Conti. It is as if all of the preceding wines are subsets of the Romanee-Conti, but in the Romanee-Conti we find all of the qualities that make the other wines so distinctive in one marvelously complete Burgundy. Aromatics reminiscent of Romanee St. Vivant make an appearance, followed by the sweetness that can only be La Tache, then the structure of Richebourg, all wrapped into the total elusiveness of Romanee-Conti. I am reminded of my university studies in music. There are some compositions that are so profoundly moving because they only point out the futility in trying to truly understand them. Some things remain beyond the full grasp of the human intellect. Romanee-Conti is the vinous equivalent. Anticipated maturity: 2030-2060. 

I tasted the 2010s twice from barrel, once in the summer just as the wines were about to be racked and then again during my early December visit. On both occasions the wines were stellar.

The 2010 surprises for its size and sheer volume. It boasts phenomenal depth and richness in its intense dark red fruit. The sheer energy and vibrancy of the fruit is remarkable. A huge, explosive finish makes it impossible to resist a second taste. This is a great showing from the Echezeaux, even if the 2010 is notably bigger than is typical for this bottling.

I am not sure where the RC starts and ends, it is simply an an all-encompassing wine. With time in the glass, hints of menthol and tar emerge, adding complexity to a deep core of fruit that continues to turn darker in the glass. The 2008 is an implosive, inward wine graced with breathtaking elegance and finesse. Anticipated maturity: 2028-2048. 

tasted the 2008s in bottle in late June 2011 after having gone through the 2010s from barrel. Aubert de Villaine describes 2008 as a difficult vintage with a lot of rain. Botrytis was an issue and the vineyards required constant attention. On September 14 the weather changed dramatically. A steady north wind dried out the grapes and concentrated sugars quickly, which also reduced the size of the berries. A further selection of fruit lowered yields to an even greater extent, resulting in overall production that is as much as 50% lower than normal for the Domaine. As for the wines, they are magnificent in my view, but will require considerable patience.

Curiously, today the RSV is quite a bit rounder and suppler than the Echezeaux and Grands-Echezeaux. It shows remarkable silkiness, inner perfume and nobility. A seamless finish rounds things out in style. My instincts tell me this will firm up in bottle, but frankly I am a bit mystified that hasn’t happened yet. Today, this doesn’t look like a super long-term ager within the context of the domaine’s very finest wines. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028.

The 2008 is a big Echezeaux that could use further time in the cellar. There is plenty of underlying structure to support a long life in the cellar. The 2008 is seriously impressive.

Layers of fruit literally explode in the glass as the wine conquers all of the senses. The aromatics alone are breathtaking, while the fruit shows striking nuance and transparency. But those descriptors totally fail to capture what is in the glass. This is one of the most moving young wines I have ever tasted. The 2008 is rich, seductive and powerful, but never heavy. Finely chiseled mineral nuances saturate the palate all the way through to the intensely saline finish. When I think of what I want Montrachet to be, it is this. The 2008 Montrachet is an aspirational wine in the very best sense. Ideally another few years in bottle will help the wine become even more expressive and several decades of profound drinking seem likely. Wow! Anticipated maturity: 2018+.

Layers of dark fruit blossom on the palate as this gorgeous, textured wine opens up in the glass. Sweet, silky tannins frame the exquisite finish. The Cuvee Duvault-Blochet is made from a second selection of fruit across all of the Domaine's vineyards in Vosne. In its finest vintages it is a terrific wine that delivers plenty of the winery's signature style at a slightly more accessible price. A recent bottle of the 2006 was striking.

The historic Domaine de la Romanee-Conti has recently moved offices to a renovated complex in the center of Vosne. Aubert de Villaine compares the 2009s to the 1959s. I will have to take his word for it, as I wasn't even close to being born when those wines were made. De Villaine thinks the 2009s will remain open throughout their lives. Unfortunately I wasn't able to taste the Grands-Echezeaux, Richebourg and Romanee-St. Vivant, as the wines were bottled in the days leading up to my visit. I will report on those wines from bottle later this year. The harvest started on September 10 with Corton and ended on September 19 with the last of the Echezeaux. The 2009s were vinified with 100% whole clusters and aged in 100% new oak barrels.

774,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"The 2007 La Tache amply illustrates why this monopole is the darling among most of those lucky enough to regularly taste or collect the wines of the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. Hints of mocha, vanilla, maraschino, and almond paste lend a confectionary note to generously rich cassis and raspberry, while Latakia tobacco, peat, clove, black pepper, star anise, and cumin contribute commune-typical Vosne-Romanee personality in spades. The high-toned, sweet themes continue inner mouth, with intimation of heliotrope, rowan, and lily perfume, while the wine’s smoky, spicy elements seem to descend into a low-register undertone of roasted red meats and forest floor. As this opens to the air, a subtly sweet-saline suggestion of lobster shell reduction adds richness and succulence. Strikingly creamy in feel, this La Tache nevertheless possessed a fresh berry edge that helps convey vibrancy to a finish that practically glows in your mouth, offering another of those Burgundian paradoxes of light and dark. Here, de Villaine’s case for long-term potential is easily made, and I expect this will richly reward at least 15-20 years of attention.  

Domaine de La Romanee-Conti director Aubert de Villaine perceives both the estate’s 2008 and 2007 collections as vins de garde, and I can’t argue with that assessment, even though when I first tasted the 2007s – soon after they had come out of malo – I harbored reservations, wondering whether to interpret de Villaine’s description of them as “ethereal” to read “ephemeral.” He says holding back the usual 5% share of production for the Domaine’s own cellar was difficult in the greatly reduced 2008 vintage, and that he is already regretting not having arranged to bottle a larger share in magnum. He still had time when I visited in April to reconsider the bottle format for three appellations, which were the only ones I was able to taste, since De Villaine is loathe to show wines in the first 9-12 months after bottling. (I’ll report on the full 2008 collection from bottle at a later date.) If the 2007s here were unusual for that vintage in the degree to which they gained stature in the course of elevage, such behavior was normal when it came to 2008, so that I was not surprised to hear de Villaine remark on a new-found degree of confidence in the stature of that collection. To an even greater degree than in most vintages, success in 2007 and 2008 came down to meticulousness at every stage; to quality of vine material; and to location, in all of which respects no estate in Burgundy has any advantage over the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. Interestingly, the estate lingered no longer over the picking of their 2008s – from the first of the La Tache on September 27 to the last of the Echezeaux on October 6 – than they had over the 2007s, which were picked from September 1-11. The inclusion of stems was lowered to less than half in 2007, incidentally, but in 2008 was typically closer to three-quarters. Vendange entier is a technique not only time-honored and in continuous use at the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti (even when it fell out of favor at most Burgundy estates in the waning 20th century), but one which de Villaine and cellarmaster Bernard Noblet have subjected to repeated testing, so as to establish in any given vintage the right balance between 100% de-stemmed (“which lacks something by way of complexity,” says de Villaine) and 100% (“which can be too marked by the stems,” he continues).

775,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"I have never been treated to such a profusion of floral perfume from this legendary site as rose over the glass of 2007 Romanee-Conti. Hyacinth, rose, gladiola, and iris are underlain by scents of moss-covered, damp stone, wild ginger, and diverse tiny red fruits. “Romanee-Conti c’est le nez,” remarks de Villaine of this almost ethereal Pinot. The contrast with the more fleshly La Tache could not be more dramatic. But this doesn’t pull back on its silken-textured palate, either – far from it: along with persistent inner-mouth profusion of floral perfume come savory, irresistibly juicy raspberry and pomegranate as well as an impression of marrow-rich, multi-boned meat stock. A wafting, wave-like finish harbors the sort of exhilarating sheer refreshment one looks for in white wine, and a kaleidoscopic interchange of colorful floral, spice, fruit, carnal, and mineral elements such as few wines of any sort can deliver.

Peat, leather, humus, forest floor, and decadent floral perfume are joined by an oceanic saline, alkaline, kelp-tinged aspect, and these surf-and-turf aspects follow on a polished palate that – despite only the slightest nod in the direction of overt fruitiness by way of dark berries – nevertheless displays a mouth-watering juiciness to accompany its myriad mineral and organic complexities. A persistently satisfying and thought-provoking finish points to the likelihood of 12-15 years continuance.

(I’ll report on the full 2008 collection from bottle at a later date.) If the 2007s here were unusual for that vintage in the degree to which they gained stature in the course of elevage, such behavior was normal when it came to 2008, so that I was not surprised to hear de Villaine remark on a new-found degree of confidence in the stature of that collection. To an even greater degree than in most vintages, success in 2007 and 2008 came down to meticulousness at every stage; to quality of vine material; and to location, in all of which respects no estate in Burgundy has any advantage over the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. Interestingly, the estate lingered no longer over the picking of their 2008s – from the first of the La Tache on September 27 to the last of the Echezeaux on October 6 – than they had over the 2007s, which were picked from September 1-11. The inclusion of stems was lowered to less than half in 2007, incidentally, but in 2008 was typically closer to three-quarters. Vendange entier is a technique not only time-honored and in continuous use at the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti (even when it fell out of favor at most Burgundy estates in the waning 20th century), but one which de Villaine and cellarmaster Bernard Noblet have subjected to repeated testing, so as to establish in any given vintage the right balance between 100% de-stemmed (“which lacks something by way of complexity,” says de Villaine) and 100% (“which can be too marked by the stems,” he continues).

778,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Domaine’s 2007 Echezeaux displays ripe red berry and star anise aromas; a tender fruit character, mingled with a hint of mocha and underlain by subtly saline meat stock on a silken palate, and a finish that preserves just enough of a fresh edge to its fruit to stimulate salivation and the desire for the next sip. Here is a 2007 that remains true to the personality it expressed early on in barrel, albeit with flattering textural refinement and a greater sense of purity. It’s small scale, but only in the non-derogatory sense of chamber music (two words I used to describe it and, amusingly, later heard from de Villaine). I imagine this charmer being best enjoyed over the next 5-7 years.

779,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"An extraordinary as well as extraordinarily intense aromatic display greets you from the glass of 2006 Romanee-Conti. Rose petals, griotte cherries, almond extract, mint, and cinnamon once again put me in mind of archetypal pinot with a soupcon of Gewurztraminer. The remarkable perfume and spice continue inner-mouth, allied to a silken textural refinement (as if the tannins were self-dissolving); to pure, fresh, but not at all superficially sweet cherry and raspberry essence; and to deep, marrowy meatiness and hints of truffle and forest floor. This pivots at midpoint, as it were – though far more subtly than does its Richebourg sibling – from perfume and fruit to almost sinister animal and mineral suggestions. The finish here is at once positively ethereal and deeply, darkly mysterious, like lingering harmony at the extremes of audibility. I suspect it will also outlive the other wines from this estate and vintage.

The Domaine de La Romanee-Conti harvested from the 20th-25th of September (commencing with Richebourg) and subjected the crop to rigorous sorting. Understandably, the viticultural meticulousness at this estate as well as its team of some 60 highly-skilled and –motivated pickers paid dividends in the context of a challenging vintage. Director Aubert de Villaine and cellarmaster Bernard Noblet vinified their 2006s with a lesser share of stems and whole clusters, and exposed them to new wood for a shorter period (thereafter racking into older barrels) than the corresponding 2005s.

780,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Domaine de La Romanee-Conti's 2006 Romanee-St.-Vivant charts its own mysterious path, dissimilar to that of their Grands-Echezeaux, as well as reflecting the strides in quality that have manifestly been achieved in recent years in this site, more than at any other at this domaine. Iris, buddleia, and musky narcissus-like floral perfume; ripe purple plum and blackberry; sassafras and licorice; along with smoked meat and a hoisin-like amalgam of spices and soy all waft alluringly from the glass. The tannins here are ultra-refined and there is a vintage-typical sense of levity, despite all of the dark intrigue of enveloping black fruits, forest floor, fungal, and carnal flavors that persist on the palate. Here is an uncanny alliance of the sensual and thought-provoking such as only great red Burgundy among the world's red wines can engender, and if this wine doesn't stimulate in you cravings and wonder at once, the fault is doubtless in yourself and not the glass. It seems to marry the brightness and finesse of the 2002 with the texturally richness of the (unexpectedly fine) 2000, two standouts in recent tasting of Romanee-St.-Vivant that I was privileged to attend. But there is much more depth here, and I expect that this wine's beauty will be worth pondering and savoring for at least two decades.

781,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,La Tâche Grand Cru,"Domaine de La Romanee-Conti's 2006 La Tache possesses a sense of sheer density and a viscosity – by no means precluding energy – that go beyond the other wines in the Domaine's current collection. Scents of bitter-sweet floral perfume, citrus oils, white pepper, peat, and black fruit distillates pungently, almost aggressively fill the nose. The marrow and beef gelatin aspect of this Pinot is salient, but is allied on a palpably tannic palate with similarly impressive concentrated cooked black fruits, dark mushroom stock, forest floor, smoky Lapsang tea, and licorice. For grip and power, too, this surpasses its stable mates. But a glance back at the Romanee-St.-Vivant suggests that you can't have it all, and that this La Tache cannot approach that wine's finesse or quite equal its mystery. Still, I suspect this will be worth following for at least two decades.

782,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Domaine's 2006 Richebourg leads with ripe, bright red fruits and smoked meat; fills the palate with sweet fruit concentrates and abundant, fine tannin, while tart notes of fruit skin, bitterness of cherry pit, and bittersweet vanilla lend counterpoint and invigoration; and finishes with striking suggestions of smoked and roasted meat as well as crushed stone and iodine. What starts out suggestive of sweetness and light, turns dark and brooding. If you don't find that too depressing a metaphor to contemplate, and if you have patience (and, naturally, the requisite budget), this should be seriously worth revisiting from around 8-15 or more years of age.

783,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Domaine's 2006 Grands-Echezeaux is altogether less charming and flattering than its ostensibly lesser sibling, leading as it does with fresh red meat and pronouncedly saline, marine mineral notes even in the nose. In the mouth, this is relatively spare but formidably-concentrated and finely-tannic, with cedar, tartly-edged though ripe black fruits, and alkaline mineral notes that carry into a striking, bloodily carnal and almost briny finish. Here is Pinot Noir in its role as a mirror for human flesh and bone. What I see sends shivers down my spine and excites my imagination, but the wine seems to have no intention of flattering me. I didn't encounter another Pinot at all like this in the vintage, and it should be fascinating to follow for a dozen or more years, but unlike the Echezeaux, I would not plan to open any bottles for at least another 3-4.

784,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet,"The Domaine's 2006 Vosne-Romanee Duvault-Blochet represents an assemblage from younger vines in Echezeaux, Grands-Echezeaux, Romanee-St.-Vivant, and Richebourg whose fruit did not make the cut for the estates grands vins. (Such a second wine has been essayed on several other occasions during the past decade. Previous bottlings of this cuvee were labeled ""Vosne 1er Cru"" which has led to occasional confusion. While the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti notoriously owns choice parcels of several Vosne premier crus, they have never – at least under the current management – bottled any wine from those sites, but rather only from their grand cru holdings.) Dark cherry, black raspberry, licorice, and charred meat in the nose lead to an initially lush, silken-textured palate, generously-fruited and tinged with clove and mace. The abundance of fine-grained tannin here becomes evident in the finish, accentuated by a hint of detached oak, but lightly-cooked fruit, charred meat, and spice continue to generously dominate. I would expect this to be best enjoyed over the next 4-5 years.

785,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Aubert de Villaine and his team harvested their 2006 Montrachet on September 26, and it was bottled (as a single assemblage) at the end of 2007. High-toned peach, lemon oil, musk, and floral aromas mark the penetrating, ethereal nose. Smoky, peach kernel pungency weaves its way through nutty, peachy richness on the palate. Less obviously dense, rich and sappy than the extraordinary 2005, this 2006 for all of its sheer viscosity and ripeness, displays a dynamic, almost shimmering sense of fruit and mineral interplay. Intriguingly, in my initial – November, 2007 tasting – this effect was more pronounced from a barrel that had been rolled to disburse the lees than in one that had undergone conventional batonnage. The youthful 2006 reflects its new wood environment in a way that the 2005 – at similar stages in its evolution – did not. There is no lack here of the mystery that should be expected from one of the world’s most fabled and expensive wines, not just in the paradox of viscosity, richness and power combined with elegance, lift, and refinement; but also in nuances that left me groping the lexicon for animal or mineral descriptors.

786,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"There are more startling complexities in the 2005 Romanee-Conti than in any other wine here today, perhaps in the vintage. A stunning, high-toned and utterly unique perfume of pink grapefruit, blood orange, tangerine rind, vivid rose petal, musk, cinnamon, sage, and cassis seduces the olfactors in kaleidoscopic rotation. I hesitate to court sacrilege or ridicule with Germanic allusions but it is impossible not to imagine a great Pinot scented with Gewurztraminer and Scheurebe. On the palate, a pure, clean meatiness emerges, like butchering a meadow-fed lamb, bitter-sweet flowers flying forth in an inner-mouth profusion. Soy and black truffle lend a dark, savory note to the proceedings, leading the long finishing procession over a path strewn with rose petals. Fear not: despite its silken texture, there are abundant tannins woven into this amazing tapestry as well, and I am sure those lucky enough to own some can retain it as collateral, then leave it to their children, safe in the knowledge it has not decayed. Reverential drinking after a dozen or more years would, however, be my preference.

Imagine a black Riesling. On the palate, a vivid freshness of fruit, pungency of spice and flowers, and melting away of what in point of analytical fact are abundant tannins, all engender an almost white wine dynamic of fruit-mineral call-and-response and clear, incisive penetration of flavors to every recess of the mouth. This is a T.R. sort of wine – you just don’t feel the stick.

A startlingly dark, mouth-watering amalgam of purple plum paste, blackberry preserves, bitter chocolate, toasted walnut, soy, and raw beef intrigues the nose. On the palate, this cleaves to the dark side, with viscous, mouth-coating concentration of lightly-cooked black fruits, charred meat, mysterious forest floor complexity, and bitter-sweet florality, but simultaneously delivers a vibratory finish like that of the energetic Grands-Echezeaux. With its palpable extract, profound personality, and refined but abundant tannins, this is surely wine to set aside for at least a decade.

Low-toned richness of salted beef broth and a hint of wet stone add hints of gravitas, but despite ample (refined) tannins, there is nothing to restrain a veritable gushing of ripe, juicy, sweet finishing fruit. This might close up for a time, but these early indications suggest one ought to revisit it in 3-5 years and expect it to offer much earlier enjoyment than the Grands-Echezeaux or Romanee-St.-Vivant.

It saturates the palate with sweet, ripe fruit and inner-mouth perfume, while introducing layers of fresh meat and shrimp-shell minerality. The texture is amazingly creamy and polished, and the long, refined finish adds an alluring hint of mocha. Superb saturation of ultra-ripe fruit but with freshness; remarkable concentration yet elegance, lift, indeed near weightlessness: this is 2005 at its best. The temptation to drink this in its early years will, I suspect, be irresistible ... let’s hope so anyway. It would be a shame for this beauty to be locked away as a collectible, even if it is capable of long-aging.

Tight and dry, it is an angular wine that refuses to blossom on the palate, exhibiting astringent tannin and a light-bodied character.

This plush, intense wine admirably combines muscular power with elegance. Light to medium-bodied, it is a fresh, delineated, spice-laden effort that is packed with pears and minerals. Drink it over the next 9-10 years.

Of course, we meticulously sorted all the fruit as we always do.”

Buttered, super-ripe apples, poached pears, honeyed minerals, and countless spices can be discerned in its extravagant personality. Rich, deep, and dense, it is the sexiest, most seductive Montrachet I’ve encountered. Projected maturity: now-2010.

According to Aubert de Villaine, the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s co-director, “2000 was a particularly difficult vintage with lots of rot throughout all the vineyards. Rot is simply a sorting problem, and for that we are very well equipped. The sugar levels were very nice, but the grapes did not have the phenolic ripeness of 1999 or 2001. Ultimately, 2000 is the absolute opposite of 1999 at the Domaine since the wines are feminine and delicate. They are wines for connoisseurs, like a cross between 1992 and 1995. In fact, I’d say they are like 1992 but with more volume and fruit.” None of the Domaine’s 2000s are recommended as they were found to be lean, rustic, hard, and backward. In addition, two of the wines had vegetal characteristics and another two may have been tainted with rot.

In the mouth, it displays an awesome silky texture and good length, with touches of nuts and spices. This full-bodied wine has the components to be a great Montrachet, but it lacks the necessary drive to carry the fruit through to its summit. My impression is that this wine will age gracefully for 10+ years. The most expensive dry white wine made in the world, the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti's Montrachet always faces high, if not unrealistic expectations.

832,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Montrachet Grand Cru,"There is something restrained and monolithic about the DRC's 1985 Montrachet.  Obviously made from extremely low yields given its thickness and richness, this full-bodied wine reveals a lack of complexity.  Admittedly, this is being super-critical, but at $600 a bottle, shouldn't one be just a bit moved by the tasting experience?  The wine is unquestionably outstanding, and it may be a long distance runner that needs more time to develop.  As the 1985 white Burgundy vintage has matured, it is interesting to hear some producers say that the wines are ""too clean"" and ""too healthy.""  Nevertheless, this young, light to medium straw-colored Montrachet appears to require another decade of aging before a more realistic assessment can be made on where this wine is going.  It is still young, but I am not fully convinced that age will bring out all the complexity one would expect.  (Over the holidays, a Niellon 1985 Batard-Montrachet was profound, and clearly a mid-90-point effort.)

833,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Most 1982 white Burgundies have long been in decline, thus this was a very strong showing for the extremely unctuous, honeyed, high alcohol 1982 Montrachet from Romanee-Conti.  Light golden in color, it still possessed gorgeously thick and succulent layers of buttery, popcorn-like fruit.  Extremely potent, this is a powerful, slightly fragile style of Montrachet that should drink well for another 10-15 years.

834,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanee-Conti is extremely backward, tightly knit, and closed, with hard tannin, an excellent to outstanding mouthfeel, and a nearly impenetrable personality.  Although this is usually a fragrant, intensely-perfumed wine, the closed, tight 1993 exhibits few aromatics, medium body, and huge tannin.  It needs 8-10 years of cellaring.  While it will last 25-30 years, it is tough to judge just how good this wine will be.  The score reflects the vineyard and historic reputation as much as what I was able to taste in the bottle.
The DRC's 1993s possess the vintage's toughness, tannic structure, austerity, and aging potential.  They will not be flattering to drink in their youth, and most will require 6-10 years of cellaring.  Typical of the vintage, they appear to be the most tannic and structured wines made at this domaine since 1983.

Long-time readers know that I am often much more critical of older wines than many other writers.  To merit high ratings, an older wine must still be fully alive with its personality intact.  With that in mind, I have to say that the 1929 DRC Richebourg is one of the most extraordinary wines I have ever tasted.  A medium garnet color reveals orange and rust at the edge.  The wine remains intact, with a compelling fragrance.  A huge nose of smoked duck, herbs, sweet fruits, licorice, and truffles soars from the glass.  This wine, which has refused to let go of any of its sweet jammy fruit, reveals an unctuous, opulent texture, and a chewy, alcoholic, fleshy finish.  The word from Burgundy's old timers was that the 1929s were gorgeous young, but would not keep.  At age sixty-three, this is as riveting a red wine as I have ever drunk.  I should mention that this bottle had been re-corked several years ago at the domaine.",,RP 85

The nose offers up sweet, clove, cinnamon, and blackberry aromas intermingled with toasty, smoky new oak.  Lavishly rich and full-bodied, with abundant tannins, this profound, surprisingly large-scaled, tannic wine boasts more muscle than usual.

The prices for the wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti may be exorbitant but the quality of the wines produced in the eighties is truly remarkable. The 1988s are celestial wines selling at stratospheric prices. The 1988 production was twice what it was in 1987, but the same as in 1985. The 1988s are fuller-bodied, deeper, more concentrated wines than the superb 1987s, and will need some time in the cellar to shed their generous amounts of tannin. The only vintage they can be favorably compared with is the 1985 vintage, and the 1985s were a great deal more forward and flattering to taste when young. There is more depth in the 1988s than in the 1986s or even the superb 1980s (which turned out to be the finest wines made in that underrated vintage).",,RP 85
870,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"I do not think I have ever tasted a better example of Echezeaux, a wine that is usually their lightest and quickest to mature. In 1988, it is bursting with rich, concentrated, berry fruit, has the exotic, oriental spice character that often marks the wines from this domaine, and is sensationally long and full. Even though it is the most forward wine from the domaine, I would wait at least 5 years before drinking this beauty. I feel it has the requisite depth, concentration, power, and tannin to last two decades.

871,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"I had a slight reservation about the Romanee St.-Vivant. As in 1987, I wondered whether the 1988 was excessively tannic and a gamble for the long run. There is no doubting its massive constitution, full body, and rich extract, but the tannins seemed extremely hard and tough, and this wine would appear to be at least a decade away from drinkability. Perhaps because one so rarely encounters this old-style, tannic type of burgundy, it is tempting to dismiss it as too hard and tough. Yet this wine might very well have the unheard-of aging potential of 30 or more years.

872,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"Extremely concentrated, exotic, and sensationally perfumed, with its telltale bouquet of oriental spices, toasty vanillin oak, berry fruit, and plums, this wine had fabulous gingery, cinnamon flavors as well as astonishing length. It is one of the most unique tasting experiences in the world. It is all pleasure, finesse, complexity and richness, and my feeling is that it is clearly the best wine this domaine has made in 1987. There are 225 cases to be allocated throughout the world. 

In many vintages it is difficult to say that the Romanee-Conti is the best wine produced at the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, but in 1987 it is utterly compelling. My notes indicate that it is more evolved and precocious than either La Tache, Richebourg, or Grands Echezeaux.",,RP 85
873,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg has large quantities of tannin, but it has the stuffing and huge concentration of fruit and ripeness to match. It is a very full-bodied, rich, super-concentrated wine that should last for several decades. I would not dare open a bottle until 1994-1995. It will be interesting to see how it evolves when compared with the superb 1986 they produced.",,RP 85
874,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"In most vintages, the Grands Echezeaux is superior in quality to the Echezeaux. However, I am not sure that is true in 1987. When one compares the quality and price, the Grands Echezeaux is probably the good buy (if such a thing is appropriate to say) of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti portfolio. 

In 1987 the Grands Echezeaux is slightly richer and fuller than the Echezeaux, but it is not appreciably superior. Deep dark ruby in color, with that exotic, penetrating, perfumed bouquet that only this domaine seems to attain, this full-bodied, rich, concentrated wine needs a good 4 to 5 years in the bottle to round into form. It should last for 15 or more years. It shows superb ripeness and richness for the vintage.",,RP 85
875,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1987 Echezeaux is as exciting as the 1986. More flattering and precocious in style, it shows excellent color, a lovely rich bouquet of plum-like fruit, plenty of spicy oak, relatively full body, and a long, crisp finish. It will be the first to mature among the domaine's wines, and should be ready by 1992-1993; it will age well for 15 or more years.",,RP 85
876,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Romanee St.-Vivant may turn out to be entirely too tannic for its own good, but time will tell. 

Admittedly I tasted it within 2 months of being bottled so perhaps it was in an awkward stage as a result of recent bottling. However, my notes on the wine out of cask also raised the same specter of the wine's being too tannic and hard for the amount of fruit. At the present time, this seems to be the only wine from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti that is not profound or potentially superb.",,RP 85
877,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The spectacular Richebourg has a stunning nose, is more full bodied and powerful than usual, very long, but also quite tannic. I tasted it twice and my estimate on peak drinkability was between 1996 and 2012. It should be a real ager. This is among the few superstars of this vintage, but the 1986 is not for drinking soon-patience is most definitely required.",,RP 85
878,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanee-Conti is very backward in 1986. The fabulous nose of oriental spices, new oak, and ripe fruit is amply displayed, but on the palate the wine is tight, hard, and very rich but still mostly inaccessible. It has a smashingly long finish and should be drinkable between 1993 and 2010.

879,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Grands Echezeaux has super color, a great nose of intense, smoky, exotic Pinot Noir fruit, full body, and plenty of extract as well as tannins. Not as forward as either the 1985 or 1987, the 1986 Grands Echezeaux should be at its best between 1994 and 2008.

880,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Échézeaux Grand Cru,"The Echezeaux is one of the best examples of this wine the domaine has made recently. Deep in color (darker actually than the 1985), this wine has an exotic, intense bouquet of plums, oriental spices, oak, and berry fruit. It is, as one would expect, the most forward of their wines, but I would still not opt for opening it until 1993-1994. This is among the few superstars of this vintage, but the 1986 is not for drinking soon-patience is most definitely required.",,RP 85
881,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-St-Vivant Grand Cru,"I thought the 1987 Romanee St.-Vivant superior to the 1986, which has a very earthy, tannic, hard texture, excellent color and length, but a persistent hardness and toughness. It may well merit a higher score in 5 more years, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more fruit. This is among the few superstars of this vintage, but the 1986 is not for drinking soon-patience is most definitely required.",,RP 85
882,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Romanée-Conti Grand Cru,"The Romanee-Conti is utterly mind blowing. The heady, intoxicating bouquet delivered penetrating and sublime aromas that were even more intense than those from the La Tache. On the palate, there is a veritable smorgasbord of earthly and heavenly delights. Needless to say, it is very rich, very opulent, and very concentrated. Red burgundy and red wine do not get any better than this. My guess is that it will peak between 1990 and 2005, as it is a bit more forward than either the La Tache or Richebourg.

This fabled estate has had a brilliant track record since 1978. Lalou Bize-Leroy and Aubert de Villaine seem to have everything tightly within their grasps, so it is unlikely that some of the lapses in quality control that occurred previously will resurface. I am sure they still cannot understand why their estate is so frequently singled out for malicious attacks, but no one should have any trouble appreciating the domaine's 1985s, which are their best wines in decades, even surpassing their sensational 1978s.

883,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The Richebourg is enormous in an old, heavyweight style. It is a tannic, relatively closed wine, with a broodingly deep color, and sensational depth and length. It would be a crime to drink it before 1992-1995, and it will last two decades.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe red berry fruit, a more masculine and structured wine with black pepper and even graphite notes towards the compelling but quite classic finish.

The palate is medium-bodied with a sweet candied entry, like the aromatics, forward and opulent in style with a rich, dense, spicy finish that feels as much Vosne-Romanée as Nuits Saint-Georges. It will need several years in bottle, but it should be a hell of a lot of fun once ready.",,RP (93-95)
896,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Pruliers,"The 2015 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Pruliers is slightly more effervescent and candied on the nose compared to Etienne Grivot's other wines from this appellation, hints of orange sorbet and marmalade developing alongside the red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, crisp acidity, a firm backbone here, a Pruliers built for long-term ageing and delivering superb concentration.

897,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Roncière,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Roncière, aged in 25% new wood, offers an exuberant bouquet of macerated red cherries, orange zest and a touch of quince. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, a little compact on the entry and later, gently fanning out with a judicious touch of spice on the finish. Unlike the Aux Lavières, it will require 2-3 years in bottle, but it will be worth waiting for.",,RP (93-95)
898,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Lavières, located just under Aux Murgers and matured in 20% new oak, has an engaging, floral bouquet with dark berry fruit, just a hint of blood orange and cola emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, plenty of edgy red berry fruit, a gentle but insistent grip in the mouth with impressive persistence on the finish, especially for a village cru. This comes recommended.",,RP (93-95)
899,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Rouges,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Rouges had a heavy reduction on the nose that made it difficult to read. The palate is medium-bodied with grippy tannin, perhaps a little broad-shouldered and rustic compared to some of Etienne Grivot's other 2015s, though there is fine tension and grip on the finish.

It has a rich and opulent bouquet with blueberry and blackberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, quite masculine in style with a slightly short and I have to say, rather anemic finish.

The palate is medium-bodied with sappy black fruit. There is a fine line of acidity that lends this the tension it needs to offset the concentration. Tightly coiled and backward on the structured finish, give this 5-7 years to mellow into what will surely be an outstanding Richebourg. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)

Lovely focus here! The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, well judged acidity, focused and quite intense with admirable tension on the finish. It requires 4-5 years in bottle but it will reward those with patience. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
904,Domaine Jean Grivot,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a pretty bouquet with red cherries and strawberry fruit, neatly disguised oak and impressive transparency. The palate is medium-bodied with strawberry and raspberry preserve on the entry, slightly grainy-textured tannin but with appealing salinity towards the modest finish. I feel this has more to give, hence the plus sign against my score. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
905,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts has a rather leafy bouquet, perhaps some stem addition here, nicely defined with bay leaf and thyme. It seems to grow in stature in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, moderate acidity but it has clearly shut down towards the finish and feels static. There is a very impressive wine here, however it will need 4-5 years before it entertains the idea of drinkability. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)

The palate is medium-bodied with crisp red cherry and strawberry fruit, fine tannin and prudent use of oak. There is focus and precision here, decent length and class. This is a top-notch and utterly delightful Nuits Saint-Georges in the making, surpassing my estimation in barrel. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
907,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru has a quite compelling bouquet, as one is getting accustomed to chez Grivot. There are pure dark cherries, red plum and boysenberry fruit here, infused with fine mineralité and that sense of aristocracy one seeks in a Richebourg. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, wonderful acidity and beautifully integrated oak. There is great poise here, power hand in hand with elegance, a consummate Richebourg that will give a lot of pleasure over many years. ",,RP (93-95)
908,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots has a gorgeous, graphite-tinged, linear but focused bouquet with orange zest infusing the black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate has a beguiling symmetry to it: very precise with supple tannin, orange sorbet infusing the black cherry and maraschino fruit with a tender, shimmering fresh finish. Wonderful Reignots. ",,RP (93-95)
909,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Suchots,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots displayed just a very small reduction on the nose, but still, one can discern the deeply layered black cherry, crème de cassis and boysenberry notes that are very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin. There is a keen line of acidity, just a touch of spice entering towards the finish that is beautifully delineated and sustained in the mouth. There is a sense of completeness and harmony to this les Suchots, and it should age over 20 years without too much difficulty. ",,RP (93-95)
910,Domaine Jean Grivot,Echezeaux Grand Cru,"The 2014 Echézeaux Grand Cru has a deep, broody bouquet with blackberry and raspberry confit aromas, a touch of fig in the background lending a touch of exoticism but nothing extreme. The palate is full-bodied with firm tannin, a little grainy in texture with a deep well of blackberry and raspberry fruit infused with slightly savory, meaty notes towards the finish that gently fans out. Good material/substance here -- it deserves 3-5 years in bottle. ",,RP (93-95)
911,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru Aux Brulees,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées has a clean and precise bouquet with black cherries, bergamot and candied orange peel scents that are initially discrete, but gain in intensity with aeration. The palate is crisp and taut with supple tannin. There is a keen line of acidity, nicely integrated oak and there is a huge amount of freshness and joie-de-vivre on the finish, sorbet orange lingering on the aftertaste. This is a magnificent reading of the vineyard.",,RP (93-95)
912,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Pruliers,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Pruliers was much more backward on the nose compared to the 2014 les Roncières when I tasted it at the domaine; this is broody and a bit sulky at the moment. The palate is more expressive with fine, saturated tannin. The new oak is a little more prominent here and will need time to be absorbed, but there is plenty of fruité and density on the finish; plus there is tangible mineralité and indeed, spiciness on the finish that has more concentration than Etienne Grivot's other Nuits-Saint-Georges. Superb. ",,RP (93-95)
913,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Boudots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Boudots was quite reduced on the nose when I tasted it, more than other 2014s. The palate is underpinned by fine tannin, very structured and with plenty of finesse. I very much like the acidity here and the elegance that even the reduction does not disguise. Long and tender in the mouth, this is a classy Boudots in the making. One of Etienne's more feminine wines. ",,RP (93-95)
914,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Beaumonts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaumonts has a stony, quite reserved nose at first -- tightly wound black fruit, precise and detailed, though not as expressive as Aux Brûlées at this stage. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with firm, almost rigid tannin that frame the blackberry and raspberry fruit interlaced with citrus notes towards the correct, graphene finish. It should be afforded 3-5 years in bottle. ",,RP (93-95)
915,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee les Bossieres,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée les Bossières has a rounded blackberry and blueberry-scented bouquet, the oak nicely integrated here, just a touch of reduction to contend with though that will be gone by the time of bottling. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin. I like the structure here -- impressive for a village cru -- black cherry, boysenberry and hints of white pepper struck through with a keen line of acidity, a tingle of spice lingering on the finish. This is worth looking out for, a Vosne-Romanée to savor in its youth but with the density to age. ",,RP (93-95)
916,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Rouges,"The 2014 Vosne\Romanée 1er Cru les Rouges was showing just a touch of reduction on the nose. The palate is firm and structured on the entry, a slightly more masculine and serious les Rouges this year. The acidity is nicely judged; it is precise but like the les Chaumées, it is very linear and strict on the finish, refusing to fan out like a more benevolent vintage. Give it 3-4 years in bottle. ",,RP (93-95)
917,Domaine Jean Grivot,Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau,"The 2014 Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau has dark fruit, blackberry and black plum, with a touch of sous-bois on the broody nose that demands some encouragement from the glass. It has an effervescent entry with a surfeit of energy. There is still a veneer of toasty new oak to be subsumed here, but there is sufficient fruit to do just that. There is a hint of black pepper toward the finish that is conservative but nicely defined. Give this 2-3 years once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
918,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Les Charmois,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Charmoix offers a pleasant raspberry coulis and strawberry nose, with just a touch of marmalade in the background lending some exoticism. The palate is smooth and silky, supple, almost nubile in the mouth with rounded tannin, good density though just needing a little more nervosité to come through towards the finish, though that seems to develop in the glass. Good potential here.",,RP (93-95)
919,Domaine Jean Grivot,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru comes from purchased grapes and constitutes just one barrel. I must say, I found the nose here just a little disjointed in the context of Etienne's Premier Crus. The palate is better with fine tannin and quite gamey in the mouth, although the oak needs to be better assimilated towards the finish. ",,RP (93-95)
920,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru les Chaumes,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Chaumes seemed just a little subdued on the nose when I tasted it: rather broody brambly red berry fruit that needed to forage more energy in the glass. The palate is clean and precise, strict and linear with a pointed, slightly angular finish that just needs more depth and fruité. Not bad, but Etienne made better 2014s than this I feel. ",,RP (93-95)
921,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits St Georges les Lavieres,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Lavières was showing just a touch of reduction when I tasted it from cask, though there appeared to be plenty of black fruit underneath. The palate is rounded in the mouth with supple tannin, blueberry and blackcurrant fruit here with a touch of spice, quite dense and assertive towards the finish that perhaps just needs a little more complexity. ",,RP (93-95)
922,Domaine Jean Grivot,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2014 Bourgogne Pinot Noir, which comes from vines in the lieu-dit ""Lutenières"" next to the RN74 and sees 15% new oak, has a clean and pure bouquet with quite plush red cherry and cassis fruit. The palate is silky to the touch, very harmonious and caressing, perhaps even touching village cru in standard thanks to the fineness of the tannins.",,RP (93-95)
923,Domaine Jean Grivot,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at Fine & Rare Wines' Clos Vougeot tasting, the 2013 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru from Domaine Jean Grivot has a slight metallic element on the nose that implies just a little reduction, although it seems to blow off with time and there are some decent cranberry and wild strawberry notes underneath. The palate is smooth on the entry with ripe, rounded tannin. There is impressive volume to this Clos Vougeot, though like several others, it needs to evolve more complexity and precision on the finish. Give this 3-4 years to develop in bottle. I don't think this is Etienne's strongest card in 2013. ",,RP (93-95)
924,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2004 Richebourg Grand Cru from Grivot was a very controversial wine when opened at the Richebourg tasting in London. It has an extraordinary deep, almost opaque color. The nose is not afflicted by the ""green meanies"" like so many other 2004s, yet it was almost Bordeaux, Graves-like in personality, as if it did not want to express Burgundy or Pinot Noir characteristics. The palate is dense, rather chewy with black sulky fruit, but marred by bitterness and some astringency on the finish. I much prefer recent vintages from Etienne Grivot that show more class and purity. ",,RP (93-95)
925,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru from Grivot is a long-term wine. Even after 16 years the nose is deep, broody and has a sign outside saying ""come back later."" I would say around five years. But I think there is great potential here (incidentally, not a view shared by others present at this tasting). With aeration, it reluctantly reveals sage and light Japanese nori (seaweed) aromas that I believe will become more prominent with time. The palate is well balanced, quite dense and perhaps ""stocky,"" but hey, this is Richebourg not RSV! Give this burly Richebourg several years and you will have a serious wine. ",,RP (93-95)
926,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine Jean Grivot has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath there is plenty of intense black and red fruit, touch of dried blood and black pudding. It does repay several minutes aeration, gaining more and more clarity. The palate is medium-bodied with dry tannin, moderate balance but it attenuates slightly towards the finish. There is a regal grand cru here but it is obdurate and backward - which is excusable for this vineyard. This is simply magnificent to its very core. ",,RP (93-95)
927,Domaine Jean Grivot,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Echézeaux Grand Cru from Etienne Grivot has an engaging, well defined bouquet with dusky black fruit, hints of white fennel and Provençal herbs - complex, the kind of nose you just want to keep on nosing! The palate is medium-bodied with crisp black cherry and blackcurrant fruit, a little hardness on the entry although that should soften with time. It is a compact Echézeaux, yet one that is well balanced and one that should repay long-term cellaring. Expect this to blossom in the future.",,RP (93-95)
928,Domaine Jean Grivot,Clos Vougeot,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru from Etienne Grivot has a fine bouquet with ebullient red cherry and raspberry fruit, plenty of wild strawberry and white pepper notes. It is sophisticated and very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe red fruit laced with soy and Provençal herbs, even a suggestion of fennel, fanning out gently on the finish to complete a very satisfying Clos de Vougeot. No surprise when I discovered the identity of the grower. ",,RP (93-95)
929,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Pruliers,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Les Pruliers from Domaine Jean Grivot has a more introverted bouquet with woodland scents, hints of morel mushrooms infusing the clean and pure mixture of red and black fruit. Like Jean Chauvenet's ""NSG Perrières,"" there is sensible use of oak here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine balance, veering towards more red fruit in the mouth (redcurrant and raspberry) mixed with a splash of balsamic. I like the tension here, the elegance and purity. I reckon this will get better and better so I would afford it another couple of years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
930,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Boudots from Etienne Grivot has a touch of reduction on the nose although underneath there lies attractive black cherry and dark plum fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded tannin, slightly lower in acidity and perhaps missing the finesse and detail of its peers. Possibly a little over-macerated? Give this a few more years to develop because there is real substance here and even in the glass, it seems to gain detail and precision.",,RP (93-95)
931,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Beaumonts from Jean Grivot has a light blackcurrant cordial and raspberry preserve scented nose, but like Maxime Chuerlin (Georges Noëllat), it seems to lack cohesion and conviction. There is also a distracting metallic note. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, blocky and chunky in the mouth with too much extraction on the finish that deprives this wine of detail. This bottle was simply not performing.",,RP (93-95)
932,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Rouges,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, I was actually a little disappointed by the Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Rouge from Grivot. It has a tightly-wound, rather muted bouquet with raspberry jam and struck match scents. The palate feels quite firm in the mouth with decent backbone, but the fruit seems to drop away dramatically toward the finish that is consequently quite austere. The word I wrote in my notebook was ""gawky."" ",,RP (93-95)
933,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots atypically has one of the more reticent aromatics from Etienne Grivot, sultry and brooding at the moment. With aeration there is a lovely pastille scent emerging as some kind of recompense. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins and a silver thread of acidity. This is very elegant for a Suchots, more reserved than its peers, but at the same time very focused and pure with just the right amount of reserve to beg another sip on the finish. Excellent. ",,RP (93-95)
934,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Chaumées has the most perfumed and floral bouquet of Grivot’s premier crus at present – very focused and charming. The palate is very precise and focused, a really tense and mineral-driven Premier Cru and I agree with Etienne that this is a Chaumées that really upped its game in 2013. This is a sophisticated, quite sensual wine that should give much pleasure over the next decade or two.",,RP (93-95)
935,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"There is a paltry 1½ barrels of the 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots this year (my sample a blend of the two.) It has a deeper color than the Beaumonts '13, the nose more complex with dark berries, briary, more mineral tones emerging in the glass. The palate is very smooth, the wood more pronounced than the other premier crus at the moment with a dense, lightly spiced finish that lingers long in the mouth. This vineyard is always a little ""bolshie"" out of barrel but it has the substance to repay cellaring.",,RP (93-95)
936,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Roncière,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Roncières could be one of Etienne Grivot's finest offerings. It has a more red fruit spectrum than the Pruliers with red cherries, mint and then later, earthy aromas developing. There is good transparency here. The palate is very tense and ripe, the acidity more “cutting” than the Pruliers with more mineralité on the vivacious finish. Excellent. ",,RP (93-95)
937,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Rouges,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Rouges, my sample having a little more new wood than the final blend, had a slight reduction on the nose so I will not dwell on that. The palate is medium-bodied and more plump than the Chaumées, more sensual perhaps with a lush red cherry and strawberry finish that linger in the mouth. More approachable than the Chaumees, this might be deceptively long lived. One of Etienne's less-known vineyards, this put in a strong and commendable showing. ",,RP (93-95)
938,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru les Brûlées has a taut and slightly reticent nose at first, reluctantly opening with dark cherries and wild strawberry scents, the mineral/stony notes developing soon after. The palate is well balanced with lithe ripe strawberry and red cherry notes the belie that fine structure underneath. Nicely focused, I just would have liked a little more backbone toward the finish but still the terroir is articulated with great clarity and it may merit a higher evaluation once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
939,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots has a similar nose to the '13 Roncier with slightly less mineralité at the moment. The palate is crisp and fresh, a little spicier here than either the Roncier or Pruliers, with a dash of black pepper enlivening the finish. There is plenty of charm here, although contrasting the two barrel samples, I suspect that the Roncier will possess more complexity in the long run.",,RP (93-95)
940,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Les Charmois,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Charmoix, which Etienne told me was being matured in 20% new oak and the remainder 3-year old, has a light raspberry and undergrowth-tinged bouquet. The palate has a crisp, brittle entry with chalky tannins. There is a brightness about this Nuits Saint Georges, a little masculine with a touch of spice toward the red cherry finish. Fine, if missing just a little delineation compared to Grivot's other crus.",,RP (93-95)
941,Domaine Jean Grivot,Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau has an airy bouquet with lilting red cherry and blueberry aromas that gently unfold. The palate is supple and lithe in the mouth, the tannins exerting a gentle grip with a slight attenuation at the moment. That should be filled out by a touch of new oak by the time of bottling. This just swerves toward darker fruit on the finish and completes a fine Combe d'Orveau, though I think that the 2012 has more pedigree.",,RP (93-95)
942,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée Bossières,"From the vines located behind the house, the 2013 Vosne-Romanée les Bossières has a slightly higher-toned bouquet with hints of iodine inflecting the dark cherry fruit at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied, a little chewy in the mouth with good acidity, quite dense and grippy with a pleasant marine note on the aftertaste. Not bad, if rather overshadowed by the premier crus. ",,RP (93-95)
943,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée Village,"A barrel blend of 12 barrels with around 25% new, the 2013 Vosne-Romanée Village has a clean and pure raspberry and crushed-strawberry nose. The palate is soft in the mouth with fine acidity, gaining a little more structure and masculinity toward the finish. This should give five or six years of pleasure, possibly longer.",,RP (93-95)
944,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Richebourg 2011 from Etienne Grivot has a splendid bouquet with ripe, delineated raspberry, wild strawberry and red plum scents that are suffused with fine minerality. This just gets more and more complex in the glass. The palate is well balanced with fine tannins, crisp acidity and vibrant raspberry and cranberry fruit. It is nicely structured, which at the moment lends it a more masculine personality, but everything here is in its right place and there is precision all the way to the precise and tensile finish. Which 2011 Burgundy got the highest average score out of 250 tasted blind? This one.",,RP 97
945,Domaine Jean Grivot,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Echézeaux 2011 has a well-defined bouquet with raspberry and wild strawberry fruit, and just a slight charred tincture (and it is really only a tincture) in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with quite light tannins for a grand cru, but the fruit is detailed with raspberry, blackberry and cranberry segueing into quite a tertiary finish. This improves with aeration attaining more delineation as it opens. ",,RP 97
946,Domaine Jean Grivot,Clos Vougeot,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is more vigor adorning Etienne Grivot’s Clos Vougeot 2011 compared to its peers: bright red cherries and bergamot scents, a hint of tea leaf and sous-bois. The palate is herbaceous on the entry with some stem addition, but it displays decent weight and length plus an attractive peppery aftertaste. This is a fine Clos Vougeot in what appeared to be a difficult vintage for the clos.",,RP 97
947,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts 2011 has an intense bouquet of strawberry pastilles, raspberry and orange blossom that is not the most complex, but offers plenty of fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, ripe raspberry and strawberry fruit, smooth in the mouth, and quite plump on the finish that only wishes to please. Not a long-term proposition perhaps, but this Vosne-Romanee will have commercial appeal. Note that it does seem to harden in the glass and reveal a green note, hence my cautious score.",,RP 97
948,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Pruliers,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Pruliers from Etienne Grivot is very generous on the nose with billowing redcurrant and strawberry aromas, but it lacks the breeding and sophistication one would expect and the oak is too prominent, plus there is some herbaceous notes that develop with time. The palate is medium-bodied with slick red cherry and raspberry preserve notes, but the oak is (predictably) too conspicuous on the finish and speaks over the fruit / terroir. The 2012 is much better.",,RP 97
949,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is clearly some stem addition of Grivot’s Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots 2011, the herbaceous element pronounced and rather dominating the sous-bois tinged black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly raw tannins. The acidity is sharp and lends this an angular and, at present, rather disjointed texture that attenuates toward the unapologetically lean finish. Maybe this will improve in bottle and it may be entering a sulky adolescent phase.",,RP 97
950,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée Bossières,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee Les Bossieres, now in bottle, comes from 55-year-old vines and is raised in 20-25% new oak. It fulfills its promise from barrel, with a gorgeous bouquet that is still laconic but very well-defined. The palate is medium-bodied, and reserved, but displays fine extraction with hints of bitter cherry on the finish. With reference to my previous note, it is probably still listening to Mazzy Star on rainy winter nights, but it has since discovered Daft Punk. Drink 2016-2026.

951,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru was aged in two new barrels and one that Etienne used to vinify his Chardonnay. The nose is a little reduced, but you can distinguish the broody dark fruit roiling underneath. The palate is very expressive with taut filigree tannins, vibrant red and black fruit, an unerring sense of symmetry and a supremely long wake. This will be outstanding. “Another planet” mentioned Etienne Grivot as he savored his grand cru. “Planet Richebourg,” I mentally replied. 

First stop - week 5 - Domaine Jean Grivot in Vosne-Romanee. After several dispiriting and unremittingly tenebrous days when the sun appeared to have excommunicated from Burgundy for simply being too bright, today there is not a puff of white in the sky and so the drive to Vosne-Romanee is a joy. La famille Grivot were all at the winery, including Etienne’s wife Marielle who I had met chez Simon Bize three weeks earlier (her brother Patrick having passed away recently). For me, this address acts as a barometer for how well the appellation performed since the domaine is virtually a roll call of the villages most esteemed premier crus, not to mention one or two choice grand crus. After the trials and tribulations of a fraught growing season recounted elsewhere, Etienne dusted off the secateurs on 20 September and the harvest continued for 8 days thereafter. He told me that due to the cold spring the malo-lactics fermentation had commenced later than usual and had sulfured his barrels three times during elevage. Despite everything, the barrel samples that were assembled as close to the final blend as possible, were exemplary from start to finish, despite having to swerve around reduction here and there. The “Accad” days have long been forgotten and having tracked most of their wines over the last 15 years, I have discerned a tangible “fine-tuning” in the last five or six years. If you are ever lucky enough to be able to compare and contrast his Vosne premier crus then it is immediately evident that Etienne expresses the typicite of each with greater clarity than say a decade ago. It cannot be denied that this amelioration has gone hand in hand with increased prices and the days when even impoverished old me could forage for affordable village crus and premier crus are gone. On the other hand, Etienne is creating wines that I think he has always dreamed of making and 2012 delivered the goods.

The oak is beautifully folded in to the fruit profile. The palate is very harmonious with great tension, a symmetrical focus with plenty of energy and frisson on the finish that electrifies the senses. This may be the best Les Beaux Monts in 2012.

The palate is all texture: smooth and silky with not a hair out of place, dovetailing effortlessly into a tender and citrus fresh finish that delivers its mineralite on the aftertaste. The Les Suchots represents a more constrained but perhaps more intellectual take on the vintage.

956,Domaine Jean Grivot,Chambolle-Musigny La Combe d'Orveau,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny la Combe d’Orveau has an earthier, forest floor inspired bouquet following the Nuits Saint Georges – more introspective but still complex. The palate zings with energy in the mouth: real jack-in-the-box mineralite here armed with a positively stony, linear finish that leaves the mouth tingling. Superb! 

First stop - week 5 - Domaine Jean Grivot in Vosne-Romanee. After several dispiriting and unremittingly tenebrous days when the sun appeared to have excommunicated from Burgundy for simply being too bright, today there is not a puff of white in the sky and so the drive to Vosne-Romanee is a joy. La famille Grivot were all at the winery, including Etienne’s wife Marielle who I had met chez Simon Bize three weeks earlier (her brother Patrick having passed away recently). For me, this address acts as a barometer for how well the appellation performed since the domaine is virtually a roll call of the villages most esteemed premier crus, not to mention one or two choice grand crus. After the trials and tribulations of a fraught growing season recounted elsewhere, Etienne dusted off the secateurs on 20 September and the harvest continued for 8 days thereafter. He told me that due to the cold spring the malo-lactics fermentation had commenced later than usual and had sulfured his barrels three times during elevage. Despite everything, the barrel samples that were assembled as close to the final blend as possible, were exemplary from start to finish, despite having to swerve around reduction here and there. The “Accad” days have long been forgotten and having tracked most of their wines over the last 15 years, I have discerned a tangible “fine-tuning” in the last five or six years.

957,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Les Charmois,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges Les Charmoix is Etienne Grivot’s second village cru in Nuits Saint Georges, sourced from old vines with a propensity to ripen a little later than Les Lavieres. The nose is therefore rounded and fleshier than the aforementioned cru with buoyant red cherries and strawberry. The palate is also showing a more sorbet-like freshness and offers lovely blood orange notes on the vibrant finish. This is superb for a village cru.

958,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"There is a solitary barrel of the 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Reignots this year, which is one more than there will be for 2013. This 2012 is being raised in one first used for the 2010. It has an understated but alluring bouquet with dark berry fruit, forest floor and citrus aromas, the stoniness developing reluctantly with time. The palate is medium-bodied with a candied entry. It is light on its feet, succulent to its very core but does not quite own the complexity or the structure of Les Beaux Monts on the straight-laced finish. Whoever gets one of the 300-odd bottles – do let me know how this works out, but like Cathiard’s own Aux Reignots, I was just expecting more given the repute of this premier cru.

The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry. It is well balanced with supple tannins, hints of orange rind infusing the black and red berry fruits with a forward, slightly showy finish tinged with iodine. This should be a generous Nuits with plenty of fruite.

It has a fragrant bouquet: the fruit a tinge blacker than the Vosne-Romanee with blackcurrant joining the chorus line. The oak is neatly integrated but present. The palate is taut and fresh on the entry. It does not possess great depth like many a Lavieres, but it displays a vibrant citric finish that lends vigor and freshness. This will probably be earlier drinking than other 2012 from Grivot.

I was blown away by the wines I tasted with Etienne Grivot on what turned out to be one of the most thrilling visits of my fall trip. Readers should do whatever they can to latch onto a few bottles of these exquisite Burgundies. Grivot talked about a roller coaster vintage which was saved by 3-4 days of good weather. The estate lost fruit from 3,000 plants and yields were down 40% across the board because of the poor weather during the flowering. The most dramatic proof of the loss in production was seeing some of rooms in the cellar with far fewer barrels than is the norm. The domaine’s 2009s are equally exciting. I will have notes on those wines in the April issue.

Readers should do whatever they can to latch onto a few bottles of these exquisite Burgundies. Grivot talked about a roller coaster vintage which was saved by 3-4 days of good weather. The estate lost fruit from 3,000 plants and yields were down 40% across the board because of the poor weather during the flowering.

The finest 2008s are also well worth considering, but there are more highs and lows, especially in the entry part of the range.

1001,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits-Saint-Georges Les Charmois,"The 2008 Nuits St. Georges Les Charmois is open, expressive and ready to go. The fruit shows an attractive suppleness, but there is an element of fragility here that suggests the wine is best enjoyed sooner rather than later. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2016.  

This is a gorgeous set of wines from Etienne and Marielle Grivot that captures the essence of several of Vosne’s most illustrious vineyards. Grivot encourages slow malos and leaves the wines on the lees for approximately 15 months after the vinification.

1002,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"Smoky black tea and Latakia tobacco; intensely ripe blackberry and cassis; ocean breeze and quarry dust mark the nose of Grivot’s 2008 Vosne Romanee Les Suchots, then occupy a formidably dense yet persistently refreshing palate. The finish lacks the focus, or saliva-inducing savor of the corresponding Beaumonts. As Grivot trenchantly puts it: “this is a bit imprecise and disorganized,” in large part, he insists, in reaction to recent bottling. That said, the impression is both complex and gripping, indeed this has grand cru reach, and its maritime elements fascinated in the manner familiar from the best of Romanee St.-Vivant, next door. I expect we have here a wine that will merit following for 12-15 years.  

“We never want rapid malos,” notes Etienne Grivot, “but those in 2008 were not especially late or long by our standards – no longer than in 2002 or 2005. And I didn’t sulfur the wines when they were completed, because the volatile acids were really low and the pHs were very good” (i.e. low). Instead, most of Grivot’s 2008s were only sulfured after the 2009 harvest. Grivot gave them at least 3 weeks in tank before bottling, which took place between January and early April. Based on my intuitions and Grivot’s testimony, several of his 2008s were suffering significantly from post-bottling depression when I tasted them in late April, so readers should bear this is mind and recognize that my scores, in isolation, might prove misleadingly low. Grivot characterizes the 2008s as “dynamic but introverted” and “less accessible” than either the 2006s or 2007s, but that contrast appears to have been exacerbated by circumstances on this occasion. (In view of the delightful showing of two Grivot 2007s in April, I regret that I simply wasn’t able to taste more wines from that collection in the time available to me.)

1003,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Cherry, blackberry, peat, and game in the nose of the Grivot 2008 Vosne Romanee Reignots set the theme for a firm though juicy palate, and salt, chalk, nut oil, and cherry pit notes in an invigorating, downright refreshing finish reminding me of the extent to which the wines in this collection – by design – showcase Pinot virtues that can also apply to white wines. Since there were only around 350 liters, Grivot elected to supplement a new barrique with a new feuillette, which explains a hint of oak resin and slight sense of tannic stiffness that will hopefully be absorbed. Certainly the wine deserves to be attended to for at least a decade.

1004,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Pruliers,"Blond tobacco, faded lily, iris, blackberry, red currant, and rhubarb on the nose of Grivot’s 2008 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Pruliers lead to a bright, invigoratingly tart and saline yet creamily-textured palate underlain by marrowy-rich meat stock. Abundant, fine-grained tannin does nothing to halt either the flow of primary fruit juiciness or of saliva in response. A hint of cherry pit bitterness and savory salinity help extend the finish. Grivot is managing to capture a vivacious, almost delicate side of Nuits-St.-Georges, especially evident in this instance. I wouldn’t be surprised to witness this take on depth with time, and certainly expect it will be worth following for at least 10-12 years.

1006,Domaine Jean Grivot,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Grivot's 2006 Richebourg unsurprisingly displays a richness, meaty substantiality, and carnal depth that go beyond the other wines in his current collection. Peat, myriad tobaccos, black tea, roasted game, faded lilies, toasted praline, and dark fungal and forest floor elements kaleidoscopically scent the nose, and carry onto a sumptuously-, silkenly-textured, wet stone-lined, yet juicy, buoyant, and dynamic palate. While this wine is not about fruits and berries, it offers black cherries and purple plums to spare. The finish here perpetuates the seemingly paradoxical alliance of grip with levity; caress with vibrancy; and concentration with elegance that characterize many of the finest wines of the vintage. Grivot tasted it with me for the first time after bottling and remarked that he was amazed at what it had gained – not to mention how little if anything it had lost – in the process. You could safely plan on following this masterpiece for 15-20 years. 

""For me, the virtues of 2006 are freshness, reflection of terroir, minerality, and enormous vinosity. It is an accessible vintage,"" says Etienne Grivot, quickly signifying that ""accessible"" should on no account be taken pejoratively, or as excluding cerebral appeal. His aim to reinforce these characteristics by very gentle extraction has proven highly successful. Grivot says that since his experience in 2004 he is determined to chaptalize only extremely lightly – to extend fermentations a bit – if at all, because he believes that depressing finished levels of alcohol will other things being equal promote more expressive and elegant wines. He finds the frequent comparisons of 2006 to a cross between 2000 and 2001 reasonably apt. Incidentally, prices dropped a bit here in the 2006 vintage, an especially welcome move when one considers the high quality of the wines, not to mention the prestige of this estate.

1007,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"Grivot's 2006 Vosne Romanee Les Suchots is enticingly scented with ripe blackberry and black raspberry, black tea, peat, black truffles, and iris. While that's literally a dark litany, and while the aforementioned elements flood onto this Pinot's sumptuous and texturally silken palate, the effect is metaphorically anything but dark, possessing not only refreshment to accompany its sense of sweetness and richness, but also an uncanny sense of lift and dynamic. This should be a joy to follow over the next decade or more.

1008,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"From Grivot's oldest vines, his 2006 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Boudots completely outclasses its fellow Grivot Nuits-St.-Georges bottlings for depth of flavor, polish, and balance. Blackberry, game, peat, and a decadent lily-like floral perfume on the nose persist on a glyceral-rich and silkenly smooth, yet energetically interactive palate loaded with inner-mouth florality; dark mineral and carnal notes; and ripe berry fruit. This finishes with impressively tenacious yet somehow gentle grip. I certainly have the impression of inhabiting a gustatory space between Vosne and Nuits when I taste it. It should be worth following for the better part of a decade.

1009,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Black tea, brown spices, dark berries, and musky floral perfume as well as mammalian and forest floor scents rise impressively and complexly from the glass of Grivot 2006 Vosne Romanee Les Beaumonts. In the mouth, this is polished and refined as well as correspondingly multifaceted. For all of its smoothness as well as its carnal and mineral elements, though, this doesn't lack for ample, refined tannins, and captures a vivid sense of fresh fruit, along with a corresponding cut and refreshment of finish. It is a prime example of 2006 virtues that Grivot adumbrated in conversation, accessible but through-provoking; vivacious yet richly-textured. It should merit attention for at least a decade.

1010,Domaine Jean Grivot,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"From a southwestern appendage of its appellation – wedged between Les Suchots and Beaux Monts (and part of the former estate of Grivot's aunt, Jacqueline Jayer) – a 2006 Echezeaux smells of cherry and red currant, game, and an unusually alkaline minerality. This displays depth, breadth, yet also vivacious interplay on the palate. Ample tannins remain fine-grained and in no way block the juicy expression of fresh berries and red meat in a long finish. I wonder whether this will ever equal the mysterious allure of its Suchots or Beaumonts counterparts, but I would suggest giving it 2-3 years in bottle and then plan on following it for at least half a dozen more.

1011,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées,"Incense, vanilla, star anise and lightly-cooked cherry and cassis scent Grivot's 2006 Vosne Romanee Les Brulees. Sleek and polished on the palate, it combines sweet fruit with a nut brittle-like suggestion of caramelized richness appropriate to the name of the cru in question, if unusual for the vintage. Forest floor and animal elements supply a dark undercurrent to the palate-saturating flavors on display here, backed by considerable though fine-grained tannins, which Grivot believes were accentuated by sulfur from bottling when I tasted. This should be given 2-3 years in bottle, I suspect, to show its true meddle, and ought to be worth following for at least half a dozen years thereafter.  I did not, incidentally, have an opportunity to taste the tiny volume of 2006 Grivot Vosne Romanee Aux Reignots.

Ripe blackberry, cedar, smoked meat, ginger, and blond tobacco make for a penetrating nose and sappy, pungent palate impression, carrying into a sustained finish. There is plenty of admirable material here, even if the wine doesn't quite sing when compared with some of its cage mates.

Like spading fertile earth, one turns up new, dark secrets with each sip. For all of its textural richness and ripeness of fruit, this superb Pinot preserves a certain “cool” restraint, with no superficial sweetness.

The finish erupts with ripe fruit, flowers, and spice. This combines amplitude with energy.

Given the health and natural concentration of his vinous raw material, he felt no need to sulfur or rack the wines until shortly prior to bottling (without filtration), which was the stage at which I tasted.

1021,Domaine Jean Grivot,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"Grivot’s 2005 Vosne-Romanee Les Beaumonts delivers scents of blackberry, cassis, violets, fennel, and pungent brown spices. Clear and invigorating in fruit, yet creamy and mouth-coating, this brings spices, flowers and a note of chalk into its long, refined finish. The tannins are superbly fine and the longer this opens in the glass the more perfumed it becomes.

1022,Domaine Jean Grivot,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2005 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Boudots (from 70-year-old vines) leads with a combination of ripe blackberry and black cherry allied to a marine minerality of salt spray and iodine. Fanning out across the palate with sweet, rich berry fruit and abundant fine tannin, yet remaining invigorating, this finishes impressively long on sedate low-tones of clear, pure black fruit and minerals, yet still with a sappy tang. Considerable incipient subtlety will reward some years of cellaring, or at least a more leisurely contemplation of the glass.

Figure waiting for 5-7 years just to check back on this.

We’re up to 40% new wood already, but I would never have thought about it for a moment had Grivot not mentioned the fact.

Note: This wine had finished its malo-lactic fermentation in September, 1997, and had been racked and sulphured two weeks before my visit. This process can have the effect of temporarily drying out the fruit and decreasing the intensity of color in wines. If anything, it  will become darker, have more body, and be lusher than my notes would suggest.

Anticipated maturity: 2003-2009.

Note: This wine had finished its malo-lactic fermentation in September, 1997, and had been racked and sulphured two weeks before my visit. This process can have the effect of temporarily drying out the fruit and decreasing the intensity of color in wines. If anything, it  will become darker, have more body, and be lusher than my notes would suggest.

Even though I have a stated policy of only reviewing wines that have completed their malo-lactic fermentations, I decided to make an exception for this spectacular wine. First, its malos were virtually finished, and secondly, readers deserve to know about this wine's sublime qualities.

1108,Patrick Javillier,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"This wine is a stunning example of this all-too-often weak grand cru. It possesses enthralling aromas of black raspberries, dark cherries, beef blood, and Asian spices that give way to an oily-textured, magnificently concentrated, highly-refined, and very focused personality. This superbly sweet and lush offering is feminine, opulent, well-structured, and powerful. Its prodigiously long finish reveals loads of soft tannins. Drink it between 2003 and 2010.

Note: This wine had finished its malo-lactic fermentation in September, 1997, and had been racked and sulphured two weeks before my visit. This process can have the effect of temporarily drying out the fruit and decreasing the intensity of color in wines. If anything, it  will become darker, have more body, and be lusher than my notes would suggest.

It has a lovely honeyed nose and great weight in the mouth, quite dense and almost viscous with plenty of tropical notes furnishing the finish. All I can say is what a lucky grandchild!

1113,Patrick Javillier,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The nose on Javillier’s 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is a little reticent at first, but dunk your nose deep into the glass and there are attractive lime leaf and orange rind aromas that emerge. There is a bit of SO2 dampening the aromatics so I grace this with an hour’s decanting. The palate is clean and fresh with touches of mango and lemon curd, then nectarine and persimmon coming through on the well-defined but tightly coiled finish. This has good substance but it needs 5 or 6 years in the cellar. ",,RP 92+
1114,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2012 Meursault Les Tillets is Patrick Javillier’s largest holding at 1.5-hectares on limestone-rich, very thin soils, the vines ostensibly penetrating directly into the rock. Here he employs around 30% new oak. It has a very focused bouquet with scents of lime cordial and chalk, the oak neatly folded into the fruit and barely noticeable. The palate is finely balanced with a touch more tension and citric compared to the Clos du Cromin, the finish fresh and lively with again, just a dash of lemongrass pricking the tip of the tongue after the wine has departed. This represents another excellent 2012. 

Patrick Javillier was busy down in his Meursault winery when I called in at the property that was established by Raymond Javillier after the war, when he set about acquiring parcels of vine around the village. Yet the main focus of the business was in purchasing fruit from courtiers. Patrick himself vinified his first wine in 1974 after completing his winemaking diploma at the University of Burgundy and steadily built up a raft of long-term contracts, tending holdings through fermage agreements. Since 2008, his daughter Marion has looked after and vinified the red wines and it was clear that Patrick takes a great deal of pride in them. I have been following Javillier’s wines for a number of years now. Here is a man determined to transcend the limitations of possessing propitious terroirs, but few premier and grand cru vines. How does he overcome them? Well, simply by straightforward winemaking tenets: complete de-stemming for the reds, remaining faithful to his trusty old Vaslin press (which was recuperating in the corner after the vintage), skillful use of new oak and by assiduously blending small parcels whose final wine is often more than a sum of its parts. Patrick told me that he commenced picking on September 12 with potential alcohol levels coming in between 12.0 and 12.9 degrees. These wines often represent outstanding value and we commence with his two generic whites that offer outstanding value year after year.

1115,Patrick Javillier,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Javillier rued the fact that he has so little premier cru when he dipped into thieve the solitary one-year-old piece of his 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes, which comes from his diminutive 0.06-hectare parcel. It lives up to its name with an understated but charming bouquet that is very well-defined with traces of peach and rosewater. The palate is very well-balanced with a rounded, smooth, mint-tinged entry, very nicely judged acidity and a gorgeous, svelte, citrus finish with touches of apricot and mango. Divine. Patrick Javillier purchased his small (0.17-hectare) parcel of vines in Corton-Charlemagne in 1999 within the lieu-dit of “Les Pougets.” He joked that he produces around 1,050 bottles: those 50 bottles being very important.

1116,Patrick Javillier,"Meursault ""Cuvée Tête de Murger""","The 2012 Meursault Cuvee Tete de Murger has a precise, more floral bouquet with scents of buttercup and nettles infusing the bright, citric fruit. There is also a suggestion of dried honey and almond. The palate is well-balanced with a little more roundness than the other Meursault cuvees and it feels a little fatter and voluminous in the mouth. It builds nicely in the mouth with touches of spice furnishing the long finish. This should turn out to be a feisty Meursault that will bring plenty of joy over six to eight years.

1117,Patrick Javillier,"Meursault ""Les Clousots""","The 2012 Meursault Les Clousots is a blend of two lieux-dits: “Les Crotots” and “Les Clous” since Patrick Javillier believes that their marriage represents more than a sum of its parts. After the fireworks of the Clos du Cromin and the Les Tillets, the Les Clousots takes everything down a notch: much more introspective and broody on the nose with tertiary notes emerging with aeration, then broom and white fennel. The palate is nicely balanced and pure on the entry, the 20-25% new oak again neatly absorbed into the fruit profile. There is a palpable sense of energy and frisson toward the finish, although I would have liked just a little more persistency in the mouth. Perhaps this will develop with bottle age because I think that this has great potential. Patrick Javillier has produced his Cuvee Tete de Murger since 1997, a blend of two parcels (“Les Casse-Tetes” and “Les Murgers de Monthelie”) that like Les Clousots, he sees as more than a sum of its parts.

1118,Patrick Javillier,Bourgogne Cuvee Oligocene,"The 2012 Bourgogne Blanc Cuvee Oligocene comes from vines in Meursault next to Puligny in the lieu-dit of Les Pellands, although Patrick’s vines are situated not within the premier cru section of the vineyard, ergo they are labeled as generic white Burgundy, the cuvee named after the geological period of the rock formation. Its limestone soils encourages Patrick to use a little more new oak, around 30%, as hebelieves it is fully absorbed within one year. It has a more vibrant, intense bouquet than the Cuvee de Forgets and as usual it carries that new oak with ease. The palate is fresh and vibrant, the minerality showing through very well and infusing the vivacious finish with lime cordial and hints of orange zest. About the best generic Burgundy money can buy. Patrick uses minimal, preferably zero new oak for his Clos du Cromin cuvee because of its rich, clay soils.

1119,Patrick Javillier,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Serpentières,"The 2012 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Les Serpentieres is Javillier’s sole red premier cru. It has a pleasant bouquet of raspberry preserve and orange blossom that opens nicely in the glass, though it does not aspire to great complexity. The palate is fresh and clean with good acidity. The tannins feel firm and slightly chalky in the mouth, the finish tightly wound and demonstrating fine minerality if not the persistency one might have discerned in say, 2009 or 2010. Still, this should become a very respectable, and yet a delicious Savigny-les-Beaune.

I have been following Javillier’s wines for a number of years now. Here is a man determined to transcend the limitations of possessing propitious terroirs, but few premier and grand cru vines. How does he overcome them? Well, simply by straightforward winemaking tenets: complete de-stemming for the reds, remaining faithful to his trusty old Vaslin press (which was recuperating in the corner after the vintage), skillful use of new oak and by assiduously blending small parcels whose final wine is often more than a sum of its parts. Patrick told me that he commenced picking on September 12 with potential alcohol levels coming in between 12.0 and 12.9 degrees. These wines often represent outstanding value and we commence with his two generic whites that offer outstanding value year after year.

1122,Patrick Javillier,Pernand-Vergelesses Village,"There are just two pieces of the 2012 Pernand-Vergelesses Village this year. The nose is neat and tidy: quite conservative with light blackberry and raspberry fruit, aromatics wishing to spring no surprises. The palate is bright and chunky with slightly coarse tannins at the moment. It builds nicely with a little more weight than the Savigny, but is still just a little short in the mouth. The usual five pieces of Aloxe-Corton was reduced to two this year.

1123,Patrick Javillier,Aloxe-Corton Village,"The 2012 Aloxe-Corton Village has a pleasant bouquet of raspberry preserve and fresh strawberry – dainty and pure. The palate is simple with a sappy opening of black cherry and a touch of fresh prune, while the acidity well-judged though the finish is a little “blocky” at the moment. This will serve as decent early drinking Aloxe-Corton.

The palate is crisp on the entry, harmonious with an herbaceous edge. This is more about texture than delivering a payload of fruit, but one can appreciate the neutral finish that would show better accompanied by cuisine. Drink now-2015.

1125,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2009 Meursault Les Clousots offers lively fresh, zesty fruit on the nose, with fine vigor and tension, actually putting the Les Tillets 2009 in its place. The palate is fresh and lively, revealing concentrated, crisp citrus fruit infused with ginger and a touch of rhubarb on the composed, focused finish. This is a superb showing. Drink now-2018.

1126,Patrick Javillier,"Meursault ""Tête de Murgers""","The 2009 Meursault Tete Murger Javiller (from “Les Castet” and “Murger de Monthelie”) has a strict, linear bouquet with lovely poise, subtle scents of wild honey emerging with time. The palate has great attack at the front of the mouth. It is underpinned by crisp green fruit – subtle notes of gooseberry and cooking apple followed by a nicely defined, unpretentious finish. Very fine. Drink now-2019. ",,RP 92+
1127,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Les Tillets,"The 2009 Meursault Les Tillets offers a light, earthy bouquet with moderate definition. Hints of freshly cut pear and nectarine develop with aeration and are subsequently joined by jasmine. The palate is finely balanced with well-judged acidity. It opens nicely toward the peachy finish, which has plenty of weight, if not the finesse of a top Les Tillets. Drink now-2018.  ",,RP 92+
1128,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Clos du Cromin,"There appears to be a lot of reduction on the nose of the 2009 Meursault 1er Cru Clos Cromin. Simply, rather smudged, it trails behind Javillier’s fellow 2009s. I will seek to re-taste this. ",,RP 92+
1129,Patrick Javillier,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Lemon, violet, and chalk dust on the nose of Javillier’s 2007 Corton-Charlemagne lead to a palate with refreshing fruit touched by chalk, honey, nut oils, and the complimentary astringency of lemon pip and peach kernel. This combines formidable sheer density with vivacity and lift, finishing with invigorating length. While nature did not increase the amount of Charmes produced this year, there are all of three and a half barriques (all used once previous) – the largest volume ever – of this beauty. I would anticipate it improving over a number of years and performing brilliantly for a decade.

Patrick Javillier began picking on September 3rd, but only finished (with his Savigny) mid-month. He chaptalized lightly, keeping all of the wines under 13%. He thinks his 2007 results capture “the spirit and purity of 1984, but with less acidity, and perhaps a bit that of 1979.” But the wines of Javillier were very different and far less exciting even a dozen years ago than they are today, so in that sense these comparisons are moot. (His favorites for drinking now, by the way, are his 1990s.) And I have never tasted a more impeccably balanced or consistently delicious and intriguing collection at this address than these 2007s.

1130,Patrick Javillier,"Meursault ""Tête de Murgers""","The latest installment of the marriage he arranged between Casse Tete and Les Murgers, Javillier’s 2007 Meursault Tete de Murgers evinces scents of toasted grain and grapefruit zest, but also brine, sweat, white pepper, passion fruit, mint, and chicken stock – an amalgam that put me a bit in mind of Chablis, or – in all honesty (and with no offense meant!) – Saint-Bris or Pouilly-Fume. Nobody can claim the nose here lacks diversity, and this sets up an energetic oscillation between fruit (luscious grapefruit and honeydew melon) and mineral notes on the palate that will keep you fascinated and delighted. Not just the reprise of citrus zest, mint, white pepper, and salt in the finish but also the virtually vibratory sense of energy displayed makes this uncommonly invigorating. It might not be classic Meursault, but it is a gorgeous wine. How well it will age I can only guess (6 or more years?), but certainly do not miss drinking some young!

1131,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Les Tillets,"Lemon, fresh apricot, chalk dust, and somehow cooling high-toned green herbal notes in the nose of Javillier’s 2007 Meursault Les Tillets lead to a shimmering palate exchange of bright citrus, put fruits, chalk and salt. This wine displayed exceptional buoyancy and poise even in the 2006 vintage, and in a vintage where those characteristics are far more common, it’s little wonder that this 2007 reveals such lift, liveliness, invigoration and elegance. It also evinces a flattering creaminess. I would anticipate at least 6-8 years of reward here.

Here is a paradigm of vintage virtues as well as an especially engaging expression of its great site. I suspect it will be worth following for at least 6-8 years.

1133,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Les Clous,"The 2007 Meursault Les Clous-ots represents Javillier’s second vintage combining fruit from Les Clous and a recently-acquired parcel in Les Crotots (a site below Poruzots). Ripe peach, fresh lemon, and freshly-milled grains in the nose lead to a luscious, juicy palate in which honeydew melon seems to accompany the aforementioned features. This is almost delicate in its sense of lift, caressing texture, and subtle but insistent citric refreshment. While lacking quite the interplay or poise of the Tillets, it is very impressive indeed – all the way through to a chalk-tinged, persistently generously-fruited finish. I suspect it will be best enjoyed within 4-5 years.

1134,Patrick Javillier,Bourgogne Cuvee Oligocene,"Javillier’s single-vineyard 2007 Bourgogne Cuvee Oligocene – a wine that habitually transcends its appellation – combines high-toned kirsch, almond and pistachio oil, luscious pink grapefruit; and a predictable chalkiness, crystalline minerality, and saline savor on a palate of unusual creaminess for young Oligocene. A great many premier cru Meursault – even from the excellent estates whose wines are routinely reviewed in these pages – are less exciting than this Bourgogne. While it musters greater sensual appeal in its youth than is typical for this bottling, I am quite confident it will stand the test of time as have its best exemplars from other vintages, and I would have no worries about planning on following it for 8-10 years.

Lemon and orange blossom in the nose; Normandy cider tinged with citrus zest and brown spices on a vivacious yet subtly creamy and by no means meager palate; and a long, refreshing finish render this perfectly-proportioned Bourgogne an irresistible glass over the next 2-3 years and an excellent value.

1136,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Clos du Cromin,"The Javillier 2007 Meursault Clos du Cromin seems to represent a vintage’s reinforcement of the usually forward and flattering personality that typifies young wine from this site. Faded lily, very ripe peach, pineapple, and musk melon in the nose gain refreshment and vivacity on the palate from an infusion of fresh lemon and grapefruit, along with a lick of salt. This finishes lushly, generously ripe but without becoming fat or its decadence precluding some refreshment. The wines from this site can fool you, taking on some structure and showing a second phase of personality after a few years in bottle, but I would still be inclined to plan on drinking this one within the next 3-4 years.

Yet it is also subtly creamy in texture. Narcissus and orange blossom aromas; peach and nut oils mingled with fresh lemon on the palate; and a penetrating finish with a slightly shrill and metallic as well as chalky cast, suggest a wine to be paired judiciously at table now or given a 2-3 years in bottle to (in all likelihood) tone down a bit. Javillier admits that finding the sweet spot for fruit from this site is a challenge, and he appears to have missed it – if only by inches, or days – this year.

1138,Patrick Javillier,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"There are only one and a half barriques of Javillier’s 2006 Meursault Charmes, a wine strikingly pits creamy, almost buttery texture, baked apple, vanilla, and nut oils against exuberant, juicy pink grapefruit. The result is harmonious and polished, with a finish both rich and refreshing. This should be worth following for at least 5-7 years during which it may well acquire more sense of mineral depth and interplay of flavor.

In 2003, Javillier adopted the contrarian viewpoint that the wines needed ample battonage and time on the lees to insure a structure that would compensate for low acidity, but in 2006 he felt the need to rack and bottle somewhat earlier than usual to preserve freshness and – in his words – “Burgundian character.” While he touts the virtues of this vintage for early drinking – and this is one address where 2004 and 2005 appear today to have the edge in quality, including potential longevity – samples of several of Javillier’s young 2006s that had taken on air for a day were, perhaps tellingly, more revelatory and satisfying that those freshly uncorked.

Surprisingly bright and saline on the palate, it unites fresh citrus with its lower-toned, roasted elements in a finish of impressive persistence if not yet consummate harmony. Anywhere from 3-7 years of bottle aging would seem worthwhile, but even in the short term, this may well deploy its considerable forces more effectively. The dense, complex 2005 has a clear edge here, though.

1140,Patrick Javillier,Savigny-lès-Beaune Les Montchenevoys Blanc,"Javillier’s 2006 Savigny-les-Beaune Montchenevoy displays, as it has in several recent vintages, the advantage of high ripeness to this quarry-like site high above Savigny, whose wines never seem to lack for acidity or strong mineral signature. Javillier has come to believe that his Savigny does not benefit from any new oak. This year, we have something with remarkably Chablis-like aromas and flavors of chicken stock, herbs, and lime; this wine’s juicy citricity, carnal richness, and shimmering minerality making for a fascinating, refreshing, and long-finishing display. Sleek and texturally refined, this shows a rare side of the 2006 vintage thanks to the uniqueness of its site and to Javillier’s vinificatory approach.

A somewhat sweet-sour tendency all the way through to the finish seems to reflect the compromise that resulted from picking this early to preserve freshness, yet with botrytis already present. Hints of honey and meat reduction add interest in the finish, and the flavors of this silken-textured wine may knit itself more after a year or two in bottle.

1142,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Clos du Cromin,"The 2006 Meursault Clos du Cromin is deep green-gold in color and pungently spicy in aroma, suggesting a brush with botrytis in this clay-rich, relatively water-retentive site. Javillier believes in avoiding new barrels for this wine, not for the reason that prompts this reaction with his Savigny (namely retention of mineral character), but rather, he says, “because Clos du Cromin always has a tendency to be this said in English too much, very forward in its youth and only revealing its mineral side after some years in bottle.” In this instance we have elements of over-ripe pear, musk melon, litchi, and pink grapefruit; considerable amplitude and textural richness; and a zesty, pungently spicy finish that tends slightly toward drying and bitterness. Still, given the characteristic evolution of this wine, it should be worth revisiting after 2-3 years in bottle.

1143,Patrick Javillier,Bourgogne Cuvee Oligocene,"Generally a wine that plays above its classificatory league, Javillier’s single-vineyard 2006 Bourgogne Cuvee Oligocene is quite marked by its new wood as well as its brush with botrytis. Coconut and lanolin mingle with honey, pear nectar and lightly caramelized apricot. Fascinating carnal and mineral notes generally associated with this wine emerge on the back of the palate, and its combination of youthful firmness and substantial grip suggest that it will assert a compelling personality and should be worthy of at least 3-5 years cellaring.  I have recently had a couple of excellent 10-12 year old bottles of Cuvee Oligocene.

In 2003, Javillier adopted the contrarian viewpoint that the wines needed ample battonage and time on the lees to insure a structure that would compensate for low acidity, but in 2006 he felt the need to rack and bottle somewhat earlier than usual to preserve freshness and – in his words – “Burgundian character.” While he touts the virtues of this vintage for early drinking – and this is one address where 2004 and 2005 appear today to have the edge in quality, including potential longevity – samples of several of Javillier’s young 2006s that had taken on air for a day were, perhaps tellingly, more revelatory and satisfying that those freshly uncorked.

1144,Patrick Javillier,"Bourgogne Blanc ""Cuvée des Forgets""","Effusively juicy peach, pineapple, lime, and tangerine make Javillier’s 2006 Bourgoge Cuvee des Forgets the most delicious rendition of this cuvee that I can recall in many years. Nor is it superficial: there is considerable mineral nuance on display here which, along with enhanced freshness and a diminution of alcohol, is contributed in part by a portion of Savigny-Les-Beaune from the stony, high Montchenevoy that Javillier blended in. Enjoy it through 2010.

Complex and armed with an admirable finish, it should be at its peak between 2000 and 2005. What's Javillier's spin on the 1996 vintage? ""It has the most perfect balance between body, acid, fruit, extract, and purity in my lifetime."" All the ""regular cuvees"" were bottled in September, 1997.

1216,Patrick Javillier,Meursault Clos du Cromin,"Generally, Javillier only offers the Meursault Clos Du Cromin as a regular cuvee because it rarely possesses the natural acidity he feels is necessary for extended elevage. 1996's bright and lively high acidity levels forced him to revise his plans and produce it as a Mise Speciale. Unexpectedly, I discerned ripe olive oil aromas intermingled with more typical toasted hazelnuts. On the palate, this vivacious, racy, and medium-bodied wine has a mouth-coating oily texture and flavors reminiscent of black olives (!), stones, tangy and salty candied lemons and nuts. Anticipated maturity: Now-2003. The rating, with the range of scores in parentheses, indicates the wine was tasted from cask, not bottle.

Readers who have tasted this property's insipid, watery, thin, sterile wines of the past are in for a shock when they taste the 1991s and 1992s.  In contrast to what I wrote in my book Burgundy, the wines are now 100% barrel-fermented.  Moreover, there is considerable lees contact and yields have been restricted.  Following in the footsteps of Coche-Dury and Comte Lafon, the whites are bottled unfiltered.

All of the 1991 Meursaults reveal considerable richness, a soft, low acid, plump style, excellent depth, subtle oak. They should be drunk over the next 2-3  years. A Peter Vezan Selection, various importers.",,RP 87
1244,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2019 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is superb, mingling aromas of orange rind, blackberries and cassis with hints of rose petals, loamy soil and truffle in a complex bouquet.

1246,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2019 Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot exhibits notes of raspberries, rose petals, mandarin orange and exotic spices, framed by a deft application of oak.

1253,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 1990 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is very typical of the vintage, offering up a rich and roasted bouquet of baked red fruit, Agen prunes, dark chocolate, smoked meat and loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, rich and textural, it's fresher on the palate than on the nose, with lively acids, velvety tannins, terrific concentration and a seamless, complete profile. While its roasted, overripe fruit tones depress my score, this is a very well made example of the year.",,RP (92-94)
1254,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge Les Clos Prieur,"This immaculately preserved bottle of Hudelot-Noëllat's 1989 Bourgogne Rouge Les Clos Prieur was showing beautifully, wafting from the glass with a lovely bouquet of musk, spices, raspberries and plums. Medium to full-bodied, supple and incisive, it's vibrant and charming, bursting with crunchy fruit even after 30 years. In a blind tasting, it would punch well above its modest appellation.",,RP (92-94)
1255,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"As usual, the king of the cellar at Domaine Hudelot-Noellat is the 2018 Richebourg Grand Cru, a magical wine in the making that blossoms in the glass with complex scents of cherries, wild berries, candied peel, peonies, spices and smoked meats.

1257,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"As usual, the 2018 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts is the most reserved premier cru in the cellar, unwinding slowly in the glass with aromas of cherries, berries and cassis mingled with notes of grilled squab and smoked meats. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, with a deep and concentrated core that's still youthfully tight-knit. This is a Malconsorts with a brilliant future.",,RP (92-94)

1260,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"Another great success this year is the 2018 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts, a brilliant cuvée in the making that bursts with aromas of cassis, cherries, smoked duck, dried flowers and rich soil tones. On the palate, it's full-bodied, rich and textural, with a multidimensional core of lavishly ripe but succulent fruit that entirely conceals the wine's structuring tannins. Readers who are unable to secure a few bottles of Hudelot-Noellat's Richebourg this year should consider consoling themselves with this Beaumonts, as the latter tastes in many respects like the former's junior sibling.",,RP (92-94)
1261,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2018 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is one of the high points of the range this year, unwinding to reveal a lovely bouquet of cherries, raspberries, orange rind, grilled squab, peonies, warm spices and espresso roast. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and muscular, with excellent concentration, lively acids and rich structuring tannins.

1265,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2018 Vosne-Romanée Village has also turned out well, exhibiting scents of wild berries, peonies, violets and grilled squab, followed by a medium to full-bodied, supple and nicely concentrated palate that's lively and refined.

1267,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Meursault Clos des Ecoles,"The 2018 Meursault Clos des Ecoles had just been sulfured when I tasted it, but the wine was still showing well—indeed, it had likely picked up some extra definition as a result—displaying aromas of pear, white flowers, citrus oil and warm bread, followed by a medium to full-bodied, enveloping and fleshy palate that's fresh and lively.",,RP (92-94)
1268,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2018 Bourgogne Rouge is generous and inviting, bursting with aromas of cherries, blackberries, dried flowers and spices.

1269,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2017 Richebourg Grand Cru soars from the glass with a lovely bouquet of raspberries, black plums and blood orange, mingled with dark chocolate, smoked meats, rose petals and exotic spices.

1270,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2017 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru wafts from the glass with a deep bouquet of cherries, wild berries and plums, with nuances of orange rind, rose petals and Asian spices emerging as it sits in the glass. Full-bodied, deep and complete, the wine's textural attack segues into a multidimensional mid-palate framed by melting but muscular tannins and lively acids.",,RP (92-94)
1271,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"More than living up to its fine performance from barrel, the 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots is showing very well from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of black cherries, wild berries, smoked tea, spices and rose hip. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, velvety and enveloping, with fine concentration at the core, ripe but succulent acids, powdery tannins and a long finish. This beautifully balanced bottling exemplifies what could be achieved in 2017 with old vines and moderate yields, and it comes very warmly recommended.",,RP (92-94)
1272,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts is also showing nicely from bottle, unfurling in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of raspberries, plums, grilled squab and warm spices that are framed by a deft application of classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with a rich chassis of tannin, fine concentration and a more introverted profile than the expressive Beaumonts.",,RP (92-94)
1273,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"The 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts surpasses its showing from barrel, unwinding in the glass with aromas of blackberries, orange rind, peonies, potpourri and spices.

1276,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"Charming and expressive, the 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Village bursts from the glass with aromas of cherries, red berries, wilted rose petals, sweet soil tones and a deft framing of new oak.

1277,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"I had not tasted the 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru since it was in barrel, and it is showing brilliantly, unfurling in the glass with notes of cassis, wild berries, espresso roast, dark chocolate, exotic spices, rose petals and violets. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, with refined tannins, a lively spine of acidity and striking depth and dimension. This is a magical Romanée-Saint-Vivant that matches or surpasses the 2015 rendition.",,RP (92-94)
1278,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Aromas of wild berries, cassis, incense, smoked duck and rose hip introduce the 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru, a full-bodied, ample and layered wine that's quite charming and open-knit by the standards of Clos Vougeout and even by the standards of this routinely elegant cuvée. Framed by fine-grained tannins, it's pure, fleshy and elegant, and it should shine at a comparatively early age.",,RP (92-94)
1279,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is a real success, wafting from the glass with notes of raspberries, cherries, rose petals, dark spices and grilled squab.

1280,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2017 Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot offers up notes of plums, ripe berries, dark chocolate and rose petal, displaying darker fruit tones than is typical of this frequently red-fruited and ethereal cuvée. Perhaps it was just the day I tasted it. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, nicely concentrated and fine-boned, with succulent acids and a precise, mineral finish. A Chambolle in spirit, it's a perennial value in the Hudelot-Noëllat portfolio.",,RP (92-94)
1281,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Meursault Clos des Ecoles,"Offering up aromas of smoky citrus, green orchard fruit and oatmeal, the 2017 Meursault Clos des Ecoles is medium-bodied, satiny and pure, with succulent acids, a generous but vibrant core of fruit and a nicely delineated finish. Ten barrels were produced, of which two were new.",,RP (92-94)
1282,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe,"The 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe was a little muted and compressed by transient reduction when I tasted it from barrel, but it's a promising wine, exhibiting notes of rich soil, berries and game bird, framed by a touch of smoky oak.

1284,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts performed very well, unfurling in the glass with aromas of sweet red berries, licorice, smoked duck and an exotic but judicious framing of spicy new wood. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a supple, expansive attack, a succulent core of bright fruit and a long, flavorful finish. It's a lavish but controlled Beaumonts that should enjoy a broad window of drinkability.",,RP (92-94)
1285,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes exhibits an attractive bouquet of sweet cherry fruit, cassis and plums, complemented by some savory bass notes of grilled squab and chocolate. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, quite hefty and ample, with juicy acids, fine but firm tannins and good overall shape and substance. It's shutting down and will demand some patience.",,RP (92-94)
1286,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru is a prodigious wine in the making, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of black raspberry, cherry, licorice, orange rind, incense and strawberry, subtly framed by new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and complete, its flavors superbly concentrated and pure, its acids succulent and its tannins velvety and ample. More expansive than the Romanée Saint-Vivant, this Richebourg is also more backward and appears to possess the greater potential. ""When I first arrived at the domaine, I tended to prefer the Romanée Saint-Vivant,"" confided winemaker Charles Van Canneyt, ""but as my experience with the wines—old and young—grew, I have come to almost invariably favor the Richebourg.""",,RP (92-94)
1287,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Hudelot-Noëllat is exceptional, bursting from the glass with notes of cherries, wild berries, exotic spice, dried flowers and orange rind. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and authoritative, built around a bright line of acidity and a fine-grained chassis of satiny tannins. The finish is long, fragrant and racy.",,RP (92-94)
1288,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"From bottle, the 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is one of the most reserved wines in the portfolio, opening in the glass with a brooding bouquet of plums, cassis, rich soil and wood smoke, framed by a judicious application of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated but very taut and undemonstrative. The raw materials are formidable, but this will require more than a decade of bottle age to blossom: when it does, my score will likely look conservative.",,RP (92-94)
1289,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The superb 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts offers up a bouquet that, at this youthful stage, shares aromas of cassis, cherry, smoked duck and orange rind with Hudelot-Noëllat's Suchots, with the addition of top-notes of dried flowers and spice. On the palate, however, the wine is more layered and powerful, with a lavish core of fruit, an ample chassis of ripe tannin, and a long, dramatic finish.",,RP (92-94)
1290,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots (which hails from a parcel planted in 1910) is excellent, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of cassis, cherry, smoked duck and burnt orange, elegantly framed by a discrete application of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, silky and ample, with serious depth and dimension, juicy acids and ripe, fine-grained tannins. While its serious structural chassis is nicely cloaked in concentrated fruit, this Suchots will benefit from a good decade of bottle age.",,RP (92-94)
1291,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers is very promising, opening in the glass with notes of smoked duck, sweet cherry and peony. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and elegant, with a deep core of ripe fruit, juicy acids and an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins that is beginning to assert itself on the finish. Forget this for the better part of a decade, then reap the rewards.",,RP (92-94)
1292,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2015 Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot reveals attractive aromas of Griotte cherry, rose petal, dried flowers and orange rind, with little to hint at the savory nuances to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, sappy and transparent, its caressing, velvety attack segueing into a chalky mid-palate and finish. A very elegant rendition of this lovely climat below Les Amoureuses.",,RP (92-94)
1293,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée Villages, which hails from the lieu-dit of Bas Mazières, is a lovely wine, opening in the glass with pretty notes of cherry, rose petal and black tea. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and vibrant, with an ample core of succulent fruit and a chassis of fine tannin which is beginning to gently assert itself as this begins to shut down. Lavish and dramatic in barrel, this Vosne now shows a level of tension and energy that augers very well for its evolution.",,RP (92-94)
1294,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru has a very harmonious bouquet, a mixture of red and black fruit with hints of crushed violet and freshly shucked oyster shell, later a touch of flint. It is extremely well defined and focused, conveying the sense of aristocracy one seeks from a Richebourg. The palate is medium-bodied with filigreed tannin. There is real density and presence here and it is certainly more expressive than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment, with palpable tension on the finish. Outstanding.",,RP (96-98)
1295,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has a disarmingly beautiful nose with blackcurrant, briary and cold stone scents that offer great typicité. Likewise, the palate has a structure typical of this premier cru, denser and more mineral-driven than the Suchots, perhaps at the same time more aloof. But that is what you want from a Malconsorts and there is great precision on the long and tender finish. There is great potential here.",,RP (96-98)
1296,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots has a very pure bouquet, a similar fruit profile to the Beaumonts but with more ripeness, a little more vivacious and charming in keeping with the Suchots style. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, crisp acidity, more sensual and denser than the Beaumonts, with a corpulent finish perhaps more common in 2015. This is an outstanding Les Suchots.",,RP (96-98)
1297,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts has an enticing and yet understated bouquet with Morello cherries, wild strawberry and rose petal scents, quite complex if not intense. There is something almost nonchalant here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, crisp and focused, the chalkiness of the terroir coming through and lending energy on the long and tensile finish. Excellent.",,RP (96-98)
1298,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru, which was cropped around 20 hectoliters per hectare, has a well-defined bouquet, more mineral driven than I anticipated, possessing plenty of detailed dark cherry and strawberry fruit. This feels nimble in the mouth, with fine tannin and a fine bead of acidity. Maybe it does not have the length and persistence of the 2015, but it is still a delicious, very elegant Clos de Vougeot.",,RP (96-98)
1299,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes was affected by the frost but less so than the village cru. It has a nicely detailed, slightly earthy bouquet, freshly tilled soil aromas percolating though the dark berry fruit, the oak nicely integrated. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy tannin on the entry, notes of orange peel infusing the dark cherry fruit with just a touch of greenness on the finish. Not bad although the 2015 was a step up in quality.",,RP (96-98)
1300,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers,"The 2016 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Murgers was showing some reduction on the nose. The palate is more readable with mainly red berry fruit, mixed with hoisin and a faint oyster shell influence. The tannins feel quite firm but not oppressive, although it just needs more weight and flesh to come through on the finish.",,RP (96-98)
1301,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Village was cropped at around 28 hectoliters per hectare and is matured in 15 to 20% new oak. It has a well-defined bouquet with red cherries, wild strawberry and violet scents, quite precise and focused. The palate is noted by its grainy tannin, quite compact but fresh with a chalky-textured finish. I like the energy here and it should give several years of drinking pleasure.",,RP (96-98)
1302,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2016 Vougeot 1er Cru les Petits Vougeot has a clean and pure bouquet with dark cherries and raspberry coulis scents that are well defined, if just a tad conservative. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, quite energetic on the entry and then segueing into a structured, denser finish of black and blue fruit. As such I would afford this three or four years in bottle.",,RP (96-98)
1303,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2016 Vosne Romanee Villages was more backward on the nose compared to the Chambolle-Musigny, though it opens with aeration and evolves a pleasing pastille-like purity. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red cherry and strawberry fruit, touches of blood orange with a precise finish. Good potential here, crisp and direct.",,RP (96-98)
1304,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe,"The 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe has a tightly wound bouquet, a little tertiary in style, seeming to shut down a little in the glass instead of opening. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy tannin, a noticeable marine influence on the mid-palate and a straightforward finish that just needs to evolve more complexity.",,RP (96-98)
1305,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2016 Bourgogne Rouge has good presence on the nose, a little chalkiness mixed in with the red fruit. The palate is marked by quite sharp acidity, good body, quite primal with hints of blue fruit on the uncomplicated finish.",,RP (96-98)
1306,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes from Hudelot-Noëllat was showing a lot of reduction on the nose that was difficult to shake off—rather meaty and truffle-heavy underneath that veneer. The oak comes across a little strongly here. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly dry tannin on the entry; indeed, this feels a little dusty and awkward even if the finish feels quite long and persistent. Hopefully it will improve with bottle age. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (96-98)
1307,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, Hudelot-Noëllat's 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru never approached the quality of the Richebourg or Romanée-Saint-Vivant from barrel, and now in bottle, it seemed to stutter along. It has a slightly pinched nose: redcurrant and cranberry, but not much intensity or flow compared to its peers. The palate is medium-bodied with dry and quite firm tannins. I speculated whether there was some whole-bunch fruit in here because it felt a little raw on the finish. It might be just at an awkward phase, but still, the 2015 is surely going to be far superior. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (96-98)
1308,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers,"Tasted blind at Flint Wines’ 2007/2012 Nuits Saint-Georges tasting in London. The 2012 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers was one of the standouts of this blind horizontal tasting. It has a crisp and well-defined bouquet with brambly red berry fruit, a touch of undergrowth and pressed rose petals. This is one of the most elegant wines of the lineup. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe tannin, crisp acidity, just a dash of black pepper and a cohesive, very focused and appetizing finish. It just ""reeks"" of class and it comes strongly recommended. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1309,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was just about to enter its drinking plateau. Gentle and leafy on the nose, there is a sense of rusticity here that complements the broody red berry fruit, almost Richebourg-like after five to ten minutes in the glass. The palate is finely balanced with tart red cherry fruit infused with sous-bois. I like the bitter edge that comes through on the finish, an approachable grand cru that is probably not going to be the longest lasting of the domaine's wines but will give much pleasure over the next 12-15 years. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1310,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1989 Richebourg Grand Cru was served from magnum and displayed an open-knit, dark berry and cola-scented bouquet that feels fully mature and certainly felt more bucolic than the wines produced by Charles van Canneyt today. The palate is medium-bodied with fine balance, again quite rustic and sinewy with cooked meat/dried blood notes towards the grainy finish. Even though it was poured from magnum, I suspect that this Richebourg is approaching the end of its drinking plateau and bottles should be drunk sooner rather than later. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1311,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Here is a wine that is not supposed to exist! The bottle was opened by Charles van Canneyt, present winemaker at the domaine, the bottle labeled simply ""Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru."" He explained that at this time they did not bottle the Malconsorts separately...or so he thought. When the cork was pulled on what I shall call the 1980 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts, it was stenciled with the vineyard name. Perhaps a few bottles were made for private use? Anyway, it replicated the ethereal 1980 Romanée-Saint-Vivant that I tasted a couple of years ago. It had a gorgeous menthol-tinged bouquet with hints of kirsch and desiccated orange peel--the essence of what you call ""Pinoté."" The palate is pure, refined, harmonious and I felt conveyed the backbone you expect from a Malconsorts. It was surprisingly youthful with a soft landing on the sensual finish. In a word--divine. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1312,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe,"The 2015 Nuits Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe, from a single parcel just below Les Boudots and matured in one-year-old wood, has a laid-back bouquet, sultry black fruit with a hint of orange zest and citrus. The palate is taut and a little angular on the entry, but the tannins feel very fine and the fruit beguilingly pure. There is a frisson of energy on the finish that leaves the tongue tingling long after the wine has departed and it represents another superb wine from the domaine.",,RP (96-98)
1313,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Village, from the usual 11 parcels, has a tightly controlled red cherry and crushed strawberry bouquet with veins of dried rose petal. The palate is crisp on the entry with grainy tannin, beautifully balanced with a poised, winsome finish and a saline aftertaste. It eschews the usual heaviness that can pervade Chambolle premier crus this vintage with a sense of precision. This comes recommended.",,RP (96-98)
1314,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"I knew that the 2014 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru would be great when I tasted it from barrel last year...but not this great. It has a wonderful, tensile bouquet that just seems to sparkle. The fruit is so crystalline and laden with energy and mineralité that you almost have to sit down! The palate is surfeit with energy, the fruit perhaps a little darker than in barrel with white pepper, spices towards the almost Richebourg-like finish. Tasting them side-by-side, I would err for this over the Richebourg - it is a magnificent wine from Charles van Canneyt.",,RP (96-98)
1315,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru has a fabulous bouquet: complex and profound, quite floral in style with wonderful intensity. The palate is medium-bodied, more masculine than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant and perhaps without quite the same riveting tension and detail. That said, it comes across as extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, with hints of undergrowth and smoke towards the structured and masculine finish. It will need a few years to really settle into its groove, but it will surely evolve into a tremendous Richebourg.",,RP (96-98)
1316,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots has a really quite lovely bouquet with bright red berry fruit, a touch of violet and a hint of wet gravel. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, quite saline in the mouth with a subtle marine influence, a touch of spice with a long, slightly earthy finish. It delivers on the promise that it demonstrated from barrel and will be drinking beautifully for 15-20 years.",,RP (96-98)
1317,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée Saint Vivant Grand Cru has a gorgeous bouquet with vibrant red berry fruit, wilted rose petals, a touch of lavender coming through with time. There is real vigor and generosity here. The palate is medium-bodied with quite a firm structure. There is wonderful depth and body that forms the foundation of this wine, coming across a little more masculine than the 2014, exerting a firm grip with a slightly curmudgeonly finish that just needs time to mellow. This is excellent.",,RP (96-98)
1318,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"Bottled just before the harvest, the 2015 Bourgogne Rouge, a blend of 18 parcels all in front of Chambolle-Musigny, actually represents one-third of the total production of the domaine. It has a lovely, quite sensual red cherry and bergamot-scented bouquet that is generous and pure. The palate is rounded on the entry with fine tannin, pretty and nimble with a crisp and precise finish. This is how to do a generic red Burgundy.",,RP (96-98)
1319,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts has a loose-knit bouquet: brambly red fruit infused with decaying autumn leaves and a touch of tea leaf. The palate is medium-bodied with supple black cherry and black plum fruit, sweet in the mouth with good volume, plus wonderful salinity here that leaves the mouth ""tingling"" long after the wine has departed. This is top class, one of the wines from this premier cru in this vintage. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1320,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru felt rather stemmy on the nose, especially when compared to others in this flight, although it improves with aeration and gains cohesion. A hint of Earl Grey perhaps? The palate is medium-bodied with firm, almost rigid tannin. The acidity is well judged and lends this a sense of natural balance and poise, which particularly comes through on the tensile finish. This is a very fine Clos Vougeot made with a deft hand. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (96-98)
1321,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Malconsorts was showing a harmonious, well defined bouquet with hints of pressed flowers filtering through the red and black fruit. The palate is candied on the entry with sorbet-like freshness, subtle touches of marmalade and quince infusing the energetic citrus-fresh fruit, with a long finish that fans out beautifully. This is an outstanding Vosne-Romanée Malconsorts from winemaker Charles Van Canneyt.",,RP (96-98)
1322,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots has a similar nose to the Les Beaux Monts at the moment, perhaps a little conservative and needing to find its voice. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, supple and pure with sorbet-like freshness careening over the tensile finish. This is one of those wines that the longer you remain in its presence, the more you fall for its charms. It should be a little stunner once in bottle.",,RP (96-98)
1323,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has a tightly knit blackberry and briary nose, backward and sultry at the moment. The palate is well defined with fine tannin, chalky in texture with good tension and a palpable sense of energy and mineralité on the finish. This is a great Les Beaux Monts in the making, reflective of its terroir and very precise...but the Suchots might be even better!",,RP (96-98)
1324,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru les Murgers was showing a touch of struck match reduction on the nose. It will be interesting to see if that remains in situ post bottling. The palate is sweet and pastille-like on the entry with fleshy red berry fruit infused with brown spice and subtle earthy tones. There is a pleasing structure here, more backbone than the Vougeot Petit Vouget with a slightly brittle finish.",,RP (96-98)
1325,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée Villages has more fruit intensity than the Chambolle at this stage with lively strawberry and red cherry scents. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, good substance here for a village cru with a touch of spice on the finish. Perhaps a little conservative but hey, it is a village cru and it will do absolutely fine.",,RP (96-98)
1326,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2014 Vougeot 1er Cru les Petits Vougeot has a straightlaced, floral bouquet that needed encouragement to come out of its shell. The palate is masculine with firm tannin, a little austere with a brisk, mineral, chalky finish. This will need to flesh out by the time of bottling, gain just a bit more presence.",,RP (96-98)
1327,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2014 Chambolle-Musigny Villages, from 1.85 hectares of vines planed in 1955, was politely requesting a little more cohesion when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is better with slightly chewy tannins, a keen line of acidity and a slightly blocky but fresh finish that should gain finesse by the time of bottling. It might just be looking for an upswing once incarcerated in glass so that it settles at the top of my banded score.",,RP (96-98)
1328,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2014 Bourgogne Rouge, which was taken from tank after racking the previous week, appears to have a pretty, strawberry and blackcurrant-scented bouquet. The palate is well balanced with a fresh line of acidity, quite linear with a brisk finish. Enjoy this 2-3 years after bottling.",,RP (96-98)
1329,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2004 Richebourg Grand Cru from Hudelot-Noëllat was tasted against the same from Grivot and I certainly prefer this. It is so much lighter in color than Grivot's, and the nose is elegant and self-contained, with touches of raspberry and Morello cherry that perhaps lacks some intensity because of the growing season. The palate is medium-bodied and nicely balanced, a nonchalant Richebourg that thankfully did not display any under-ripeness and greenness towards the mild-mannered finish. There is perhaps just a little austerity here, but otherwise this is a very decent Richebourg for the vintage, even if I do not consider it to be a long-term proposition.",,RP (96-98)
1330,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru from Hudelot-Noëllat personifies the vineyard with some style. It has a stunning, pure, elegant and effortless nose that maybe expresses that essence of pinoté better than more than a dozen other Richebourg wines present at this tasting. Raspberry coulis, wild strawberry and cold stone soar from the glass with great focus. The palate is tensile, the red berry fruit laced with orange zest that lends vivacity and energy. To be banal, this is just a Richebourg so well crafted that you want to just drink it rather than intellectualize over its virtues. That's the sign of a great wine.",,RP (96-98)
1331,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts from Hudelot-Noëllat has a slightly diffuse, open-knit bouquet with jammy red cherry and redcurrant fruit, a touch of gaminess coming through with aeration, but never really coalescing. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and good acidity, though the finish feels a little abrasive at the moment, foursquare and missing a little charm. It needs more fleshy fruit to fill in the gaps. Give it three or four more years to see what it can do, but here, it is outplayed by its peers.",,RP (96-98)
1332,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes from Domaine Hudelot-Noellat is slightly paler in colour than its peers. The nose has light, leafy bouquet that is well defined with delicate floral scents emerging with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with light, slightly rustic tannin, missing a little density in the middle and consequently showing a touch of attenuation on the finish. This is not a bad Chambolle, however, I was not the only person to notice some oxidization in the glass. I'd like to revisit this wine again as it showed so much potential out of barrel.",,RP (96-98)
1333,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Malconsorts was the latest to finish its malolactic in mid-September. The nose has plenty of energy: red berry fruit, orange sorbet, wet limestone and fresh prune scents. The palate is primal with a dense body of red fruit. There is better weight here than the Suchots with more persistence on the peacock’s tail finish. Is this the Malconsorts of the vintage?",,RP (96-98)
1334,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a more broody bouquet compared to the Romanée Saint Vivant, the fruit darker, though perhaps eventually that subtle floral note with become more pronounced. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, a fine bead of acidity plus a firm backbone and focus, although at the moment it does not have the sheer untrammeled chutzpah of the R,S,V. Still impressive though, and Charles mentioned that it was changing each day.",,RP (96-98)
1335,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots, which comes from the domains century-old vines on more clayey soil than the Beaumonts, has a pixilated bouquet with vibrant red currant and cranberry scents, more floral than the aforementioned premier cru. The palate is medium-bodied with supple juicy tannins, a fine line of acidity and a tangy marmalade-tinged finish that coats the mouth in spicy red fruit. There is just lovely build to this Suchots that is streets ahead of the 2012.",,RP (96-98)
1336,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes was the only cuvée that had been racked since it had been very reduced. There are four barrels, of which two are new. It has a lively and very natural bouquet that is well defined: the real essence of pinoté here, gently caressing and seducing the senses. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree and supple tannins, crisp acidity and a juicy corpulent finish that will seduce at ten paces. This is a fantastic Chambolle Charmes that will give years of pleasure.",,RP (96-98)
1337,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Murgers has a cohesive bouquet with red currant, raspberry and just a touch of tinned peach, quite Vosne-like in style. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, the oak needing a little more time to fully integrate. But it is endowed with a pleasant, endearing spiciness, almost fieriness that lends the finish intrigue. This has finesse and focus, constituting and supremely well-crafted 2013.",,RP (96-98)
1338,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas de Combe,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Bas de Combes was showing a lot of reduction on the nose. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, ripe black cherry and raspberry fruit, a touch of sea salt and a gentle grip. A little masculine on the finish with good structure and acidity, this is a fine and quite sophisticated Nuits Saint Georges in the making.",,RP (96-98)
1339,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vougeot 1er Cru Les Petits Vougeot,"The 2013 Vougeot 1er Cru les Petit Vougeot has a slightly leaner bouquet compared to the other crus from Hudelot-Noellat and needs to put on a little more fruit intensity during its maturation. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red fruit, a slight balsamic note toward the finish that exerts and insistent grip, a pleasant saltiness appearing on the aftertaste. There is good substance here and great persistence and it may well surpass last year's wine.",,RP (96-98)
1340,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée Village has a delicate red cherry, bergamot and strawberry-scented bouquet that gently unfolds but never gets carried away. The palate is well balanced with confit-like red berry fruit, strawberry jam and boysenberry, revealing satisfying weight on the finish. This has very good potential for a Village Cru and comes strongly recommended for those who cannot afford the Grand Crus.",,RP (96-98)
1341,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny Village, which is matured in 20% new oak, has  a very harmonious and quite intense bouquet with pure raspberry and wild strawberry scents unfurling. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin: crisp dark berry fruit with black plum and a dash of black spice on the finish. There is impressive length here for a village cru that is compact but focused.",,RP (96-98)
1342,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge had already been bottled when I visited the domaine in late November. The nose is slightly reduced: light but floral with brambly red and black fruit intermingled. The palate is medium-bodied with light tannin, simple clean red cherries and an innocuous finish.",,RP (96-98)
1343,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru comes from 0.48-hectares of vine planted back in 1920 It already boasts a show-stopping mineral-rich bouquet that offers astounding definition and focus. Terroir, terroir and terroir. The palate is medium-bodied with superb definition and so much freshness it does not know what to do with itself. Beautifully focused, refined and feminine, this might be the quintessential R.S.V. of the vintage. 

Dusk was falling as I pulled up outside Domaine Alain Hudelot-Noellat in Vougeot. It is always good to finish the day with a producer whose wines you admire and this was a fitting denouement to a long day in various cellars. I met Alain’s grandson, 25-year old Charles von Canneyt. After working in New Zealand, hence has superb English, his first vintage at the domaine was in 2008. He comes across as a relaxed, self-effacing winemaker at ease with the enviable cache of holdings, not predisposed to long orations about each wine, but willing to furnish you with everything you need to know. In a short space of time he has endured/experienced the whole gamut of vintages variations. “After 2012, I thought at least I had experienced the most difficult growing season,” he told me. “That was before 2013.” I replied that it was all part of a learning curve. It is just such seasons where you really hone your craft, and it stands you in a good stead for the future. He told me that after successful experimentations with whole cluster fermentation in 2011, he expanded this practice so that all the 2012s were vinified with 20% stem addition. The one anomaly is the Romanee-Saint-Vivant. Charles decided to literally “chuck in” a crate of stems, a little “seasoning” into the vat and he intends to continue the practice henceforth, perhaps in a more premeditated manner and subject to vintage variation.

1344,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru, which comes from a 0.28-hectare parcel planted in 1950, this year contains 20% whole bunches and the domaine were graced with five barrels. It has a very refined and distinctly aristocratic bouquet adorned with beautifully defined black and red fruits, perhaps leaning towards the former with aeration. Touches of seaweed and tilled earth emerge with time. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannins. It does not have the charm of the RSV at the moment, but there is beguiling structure and symmetry with a long mineral laden finish. Superb.

This year it was reduced from three to two and a half barrels. It has a broody, intense but entrancing bouquet with dark plum, raspberry and mineral scents that are beautifully placed. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins. There is plenty of intense red and black fruit dialed into this nascent Malconsorts that is almost regimented in style, but with a wonderful linear finish that is compelling. Superb.

It has a beautiful clean and pure bouquet with red cherries, fresh strawberry and mineral scents that expand with modest aeration. The oak is neatly interwoven here. The palate is medium-bodied with very taut and fine tannins, insistent grip with superb structure on the finish. Is this really just a village cru? Superb!

1347,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2012 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru comes from 0.69-hectare of vine from 3 parcels, two close to the chateau and the other down towards the Route Nationale. It has a feminine, floral bouquet with touches of bergamot and raspberry preserve developing in the glass. These aromatics are very alluring even at this primordial stage. The palate appears vibrant with crisp tannins; underpinned by taut red berry fruit with fine mineralite flourishing towards the finish. This is very classy – another over-achieving 2012 wine from Burgundy’s most famous clos. 

Dusk was falling as I pulled up outside Domaine Alain Hudelot-Noellat in Vougeot. It is always good to finish the day with a producer whose wines you admire and this was a fitting denouement to a long day in various cellars. I met Alain’s grandson, 25-year old Charles von Canneyt. After working in New Zealand, hence has superb English, his first vintage at the domaine was in 2008. He comes across as a relaxed, self-effacing winemaker at ease with the enviable cache of holdings, not predisposed to long orations about each wine, but willing to furnish you with everything you need to know. In a short space of time he has endured/experienced the whole gamut of vintages variations. “After 2012, I thought at least I had experienced the most difficult growing season,” he told me. “That was before 2013.” I replied that it was all part of a learning curve. It is just such seasons where you really hone your craft, and it stands you in a good stead for the future. He told me that after successful experimentations with whole cluster fermentation in 2011, he expanded this practice so that all the 2012s were vinified with 20% stem addition. The one anomaly is the Romanee-Saint-Vivant.

1348,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny Village comes from 11 parcels and sees around 20% new oak. It has a perfumed bouquet with scents of crushed strawberry, redcurrant and forest floor that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with taut, tensile tannins. This is a little angular at the moment, but very fresh with superb tension on the finish. This is another one of those Chambolle village crus punching well above its weight.

1349,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee Village comes from the family’s 0.80-hectare plot in “Bas-Mazieres”. It has a crisp, slightly more stemmy bouquet with commendable definition and character. Plenty of forest floor and undergrowth scents infusing the red fruit profile here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, slightly brittle tannins. There is good fruit concentration though it is quite compact on the finish, linear and not quite possessing the charm of the Chambolle. Still it has good potential.

It has a slightly muted nose out of barrel, but it unfurls revealing earthy, mossy scents with aeration. The palate is clean and fresh, but somehow foursquare and a little conservative compared to some of the domaine’s other premier crus. You get the impression that this Les Suchots is hiding something up its sleeve, whereas this vineyard is habitually one of the most expressive in its youth.

1351,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2012 Bourgogne Rouge comes from four parcels, two located in Chambolle with one parcel over 60-years old, the others between 30 and 40 years. It has a crisp delicate bouquet with scents of raspberry leaf and blackberry, hints of bergamot developing with aeration. The palate is clean and fresh with pert raspberry and redcurrant fruit on the entry, well judged acidity and a brisk, linear finish as fresh as a daisy. Lovely! 

It was my first visit to Domaine Hudelot-Baillet in Chambolle-Musigny. I chanced upon the wine at “The Sampler” in London when the name was little known. I was instantly taken with the wines and had been meaning to visit the winery since that time. Joel Hudelot founded the domaine in 1981 after being handed down small parcels of vine by his father Paul Hudelot and his mother Chantal Baillet. Paul retired in 2004 and his son-in-law Dominique Leguen took over the running of the estate, having worked alongside Paul since 1998. Dominique comes across has a straightforward, self-effacing vigneron, uninterested in bells and whistles to create flash wine, but rather using simple tenets in order to exploit his holdings to the full. Here, the harvest began on 22 September and yields were reduced, though having said that, 28hl/ha is not as pitiful as other growers. Everything here is de-stemmed, sorted but not crushed, and sees a modest amount of new oak from several cooperages such as Rousseau, Francois Freres and CaVin. As I anticipated, I adored these 2012s. They are clean, pure, weightless yet intense, adroitly expressing their terroirs with style and honesty, whether that is his delicious Bourgogne Passetoutgrain (one of the best I have tasted) or a sublime Bonnes-Mares, his sole grand cru.

It has a strong undergrowth/earthy bouquet, well defined but broody at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with plenty of candied sweet fruit on the entry, which comes as a surprise after the slightly austere nose. It builds nicely in the mouth – never complex but precise and long. Very fine.

This delicious, harmonious 2009 is a great introduction to the vintage. The Bourgogne was bottled in late December, 2010. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2017.  

I tasted the following wines with Charles Van Canneyt, Alain Hudelot’s grandson. Van Canneyt showed me a few 2008s before moving into the 2009s. The estate did some chaptalization in 2008. Based on the selection of wines I tasted, that may have robbed some of the 2008s of their vintage character. Vintage 2009 seems to have played more to the estate’s strengths. The estate used 50% new oak for the Grand Crus and 30% for the 1ers.

It is a soft, supple 2008, and while undoubtedly very well-made, it lacks the visceral thrill of the very finest wines of the vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022.

This is already pretty forward and ready to drink, both unusual in this vintage. Van Canneyt remarks that Les Murgers is the estate’s first parcel to ripen and therefore the first to be harvested.

1376,Alain Hudelot-Noellat,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Some new oak was detectable in the 1991 Chambolle-Musigny-Les Charmes, but the overall impression is of a wine of exceptional ripeness and richness, with beautiful balance, low acidity, and a soft, sumptuous finish.  Perfumed and rich, it is ideal for drinking over the next 7-8 years.

Hudelot's 1991s are the finest wines I have tasted from this estate.  Low yields, along with Hudelot junking his mobile bottler, who often stripped the wines by excessive filtration, have worked wonders regarding the final product.  All of these offerings taste like fat, voluptuous, opulent 1990s.  Gobs of sweet ripe fruit can be found in every wine, as they make for luscious, decadent mouthfuls of red burgundy.  All the wines are recommended, but several possess more complexity and aromatic dimension.

This estate, which for years produced wines far below their qualitative pedigrees, is back on track.

Readers who are familiar with the history of Burgundy know that Napoleon ended the monarchy's laws of primogeniture (whereby the eldest son was the sole inheritor) and instituted laws forcing the equal partition of a family's assets among all its children.

A prime example of this is the fact that Domaine Pierre Damoy is owned by a multitude of family members, with the present day administrator, Pierre Damoy, owning less that 1%.

The domaine's old vines in this superbly situated premier cru have put in a very strong showing this year, and like the Savigny AOC, this was already in bottle when I tasted it.",,RP 90
1419,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"Notions of sweet red berries, plums, spices and citrus rind introduce the 2017 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses, a medium-bodied wine with a pretty core of crunchy fruit that was hard to read when I tasted it, with some dissolved carbon dioxide drying out the back end. I'm confident that it will be considerably more charming in bottle.",,RP 90
1420,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"Already bottled, the 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village offers up expressive aromas of raspberries, orange rind and dried flowers, followed by a medium-bodied, supple wine with a succulent core of sappy fruit, framed by melting tannins. François de Nicolay opted for a shorter than usual élevage because the wine went through its malolactic fermentation early and clarified rapidly.",,RP 90
1421,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"The 2017 Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières displays a spicy, earthy bouquet of forest floor and berries, followed by a medium-bodied, open-knit but chewy palate. It isn't as tight-knit and forbidding as Aloxe-Corton can be, but it isn't the fleshiest or most concentrated wine in the cellar either.",,RP 90
1422,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru is immensely impressive, unfurling in the glass with aromas of wild blueberries, raspberries and cassis that mingle with notions of dark chocolate, musk, violets and ineffable savory bass notes. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional, with superb concentration, tangy acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. It's one of the two or three finest expressions of the hill of Corton to be found—with the domaine's fleshier, more gourmand Corton Bressandes not far behind. As readers may know, the de Nicolays’ holdings in the Clos du Roi are located at the top of this large vineyard, where the soils are redder and sandier than those classified—in white—as Corton-Charlemagne but which feature the same type of marl.",,RP 90
1423,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru is also showing extremely well, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, ripe plums, dark chocolate, dried flowers and spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a deep, layered core, succulent balancing acids and a long, intense and beautifully soil-driven finish. Cropped at 22 hectoliters per hectare, this is an exceptional Bressandes that will be well worth seeking out.",,RP 90
1424,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"Bursting with aromas of dark berries, blood orange, rich soil and sapid nuances, the 2016 Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru is full-bodied, satiny and layered, with a deep core of fruit, chalky structuring tannins and a somewhat chunky profile that reflects its situation at the bottom of the hill of Corton's grand cru sector.",,RP 90
1425,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Bourgogne Gelée Royale,"After the year's frosts, fully 11 hectares of vineyards produced a mere seven barrels of wine, which de Nicolay bottled as the 2016 Bourgogne Gelée Royale. Given the higher appellations that inform its blend, it's unsurprising that this cuvée punches far above the level expected for a generic wine, unfurling in the glass with notes of raspberries, plums, grilled meat, dark chocolate and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied and velvety with considerable substance and concentration. Given its structure and depth, it will reward a decade's bottle age.",,RP 90
1426,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"More musky and exotic, the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru reveals notions of ripe peach, apricot, honeycomb and citrus blossom. On the palate, it's full-bodied, glossy and rich, with a thick, unctuous attack but juicy acids and refreshing phenolic grip on the back end.",,RP 90
1427,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"The 2016 Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières was showing very well, exhibiting notes of sweet red berries, cassis, orange rind, grilled squab and chocolate. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with juicy acids and an unusually supple, even seductive profile for the appellation. This has fleshed out considerably since I tasted it from barrel and it's now decidedly impressive.",,RP 90
1428,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Grand Cru Blanc,"The rare 2016 Corton Grand Cru Blanc wafts from the glass with aromas of green apple, yellow orchard fruit, peaches, pastry cream and white flowers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and phenolic—structured more like a red wine than a white—with an expansive attack but a taut, chalky finish. Given its format, it could evolve in a very interesting direction in bottle.",,RP 90
1429,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux,"The 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux bursts with notes of sweet cherries, mossy soil and spices, subtly framed by new wood. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fine-grained, with a generous core of juicy fruit, an open-knit profile and gently chewy tannins on the back end.",,RP 90
1430,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 1990 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses is a classic example of the vintage, and it's drinking very well, exhibiting an expressive and fully mature bouquet of ripe cherries, dark chocolate, grilled squab, woodsmoke and truffley soil, framed by an exotic top note of dried roses. On the palate, it's full-bodied, rich and hearty, with an ample core of fruit that's still framed by fine-grained but chalky structuring tannins. While it's mature, it should hold its plateau for another decade or more.",,RP 90
1431,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"The 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune Village continues to go from strength to strength, and this bottle was even more satiny and seductive than the last bottle I drank, some six months earlier. Wafting from the glass with a fragrant bouquet of raspberries, red cherries, rose petals and incipient hints of mossy soil, it's medium to full-bodied, supple and expansive, with melting tannins, a tangy core of fruit and a long, beautifully delineated finish. With time in bottle, this wine's vibrant energy is becoming just as apparent as its ripe fruit.",,RP 90
1432,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru is a magical wine in the making, opening in the glass with a deep and brooding bouquet of cherries, plum preserve, espresso roast, rich soil, dark chocolate and dried rose petals. On the palate, the wine is incredibly complete and multidimensional, with an ample chassis of fine-grained, chalky tannins, a bright line of acidity, and immense concentration and length. More deep and layered than the Corton Bressandes, this Clos du Roi is also finer-boned and more mineral, its aromas and flavors less wild and ""sauvage,"" and while the wine's considerable structure will demand a decade of bottle age, this will be a benchmark Corton in the fullness of time.",,RP 90
1433,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"From vines planted in the 1950s, the 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières is a one of the highlights of the range this year, wafting from the glass with a fragrant and projected bouquet of orange rind, potpourri, plum, raspberry and incipient forest floor. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, velvety and sapid, with a rich attack, succulent acids, an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins and a long, saline finish. A superb Lavières that has yet to shut down.",,RP 90
1434,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses is excellent and offers up a deep and complex bouquet of black cherry, chocolate, wild berries, game bird and rich spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and complete, with a velvety attack, a deep core and a rich tannic chassis. The Ile de Vergelesses is more structurally elegant than the Les Vergelesses bottling (which hails from lower down the slope), but it's just as concentrated and deep. I suspect this will evolve like a modern-day version of the lovely 1990.",,RP 90
1435,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is excellent, revealing a complex bouquet of apples, preserved citrus, smoke, hazelnut cream, iodine and petrol. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, with more density and dimension than the Corton Blanc, with a tight-knit core, good concentration and succulent acids. This is the most reserved of the Chandon de Briailles whites and will merit some bottle age. This is a characterful Corton-Charlemagne.",,RP 90
1436,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru is lovely, wafting from the glass with a rich bouquet of cassis, asphalt, grilled squab, dark chocolate and black cherry. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with excellent volume, depth and dimension, its chassis of fine tannins framing a deep core of smoky black fruit and asserting itself on the youthfully chewy finish. This is another of Chandon de Briailles' 2015s that evokes the 1990 vintage in personality.",,RP 90
1437,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"The 2015 Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières is a youthful classic, revealing aromas of sweet red berries, cassis, tobacco leaf, chestnuts and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, sapid and complete, with strikingly refined tannins for a young Aloxe (though Valozières, from just below Corton Bressandes, does often seem to share some of the gourmand qualities of the latter), with bright acids and a deep core of fruit that lingers on the sappy finish.",,RP 90
1438,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses displays just as much potential from bottle as it did from barrel, wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of plums, chocolate, grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and concentrated, its chassis of fine-grained tannins more assertive than the Savigny Lavières, its finish long and taut. This will need a few years in the cellar, but it will evolve into a beautiful bottle of Les Vergelesses.",,RP 90
1439,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Grand Cru Blanc,"The 2015 Corton Grand Cru Blanc is lovely, leading with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, hazelnut cream, white flowers and fresh pear. On the palate, the wine is glossy, expansive and quite dramatic on the attack, but it tenses up on the mid-palate and finishes with bright acids and phenolic grip. Like the Ile de Vergelesses, this is showing more precision from bottle than it did from barrel.",,RP 90
1440,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses Blanc,"The 2015 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses Blanc is lovely, offering up pretty notes of buttered apples, pear and citrus. On the palate, the wine is more cohesive than it was from barrel, with a glossy attack, succulent acids and a chalky, flavorful finish.",,RP 90
1441,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru is superb, soaring from the glass with a stunningly complex bouquet of cassis, plums, tar, black truffle, dark chocolate and rich spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, powerful and dramatic, with a lavish, layered attack; a massively deep, concentrated and multidimensional mid-palate; and an ample chassis of fine-grained, velvety tannins that assert themselves on the youthfully chewy finish. This Corton-Bressandes' sheer scale will demand a decade of cellaring, but this wine exemplifies just what was possible on the hill of Corton in the 2015 vintage.",,RP 90
1442,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 2000 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses from Chandon de Briailles is a great success this year, wafting from the glass with a pretty bouquet of ripe cherry, cinnamon, squab and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is silky, supple and medium to full-bodied, with an expansive attack, melting tannins and a savory and quite penetrating finish. This is drinking beautifully and exemplifies the charm of the best 2000 red Burgundies.",,RP 90
1443,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux,"The 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux, which comes from vines located on the mid-slope, has a tightly wound, pressed rose petal-tinged bouquet that clearly possesses more harmony and cohesion than the village cru. The palate is grainy on the entry with dusky black fruit, quite pointed acidity and showing some bitter cherry, earthy notes on the masculine, austere finish. It needs the flesh that I anticipated in this vintage - this feels a little raw compared to the Pernand-Vergelesses from Chandon des Briailles.",,RP 90
1444,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru has the most expressive nose of the three Cortons from Chandon des Briailles - very succinct with neatly placed red fruit, limestone and oyster shell scents that gently waft from the glass. The palate is taut and linear like its two ""siblings,"" yet there is more substance and depth here, a touch more volume and sweetness towards the saline finish. This will require 4-5 years in the cellar, but it will be worth waiting for. Kingly!",,RP 90
1445,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"The 2014 Aloxe Corton 1er Cru les Valozières has a fragrant nose of red berry fruit mixed with a touch of wet clay. It is nicely defined and opens in the glass. The palate is crisp and citrus-fresh on the entry, lively and energetic with an effervescent orange peel-infused finish, and requisite salinity to urge you to take another sip.",,RP 90
1446,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru has another detailed, precise and quite mineral-driven bouquet that opens nicely in the glass. The palate is poised on the entry, linear and taut with tart red cherry fruit mixed with strawberry and a touch of oyster shell coming through on the finish. Very fine, even if the Corton Maréchaudes may have the upper hand with bottle age. We will see!",,RP 90
1447,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 2014 Pernand Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses, from limestone soils, has a very terroir-driven, mineral-rich bouquet with delicate floral scents developing. The palate is crisp and linear, very well balanced and full of freshness. It exerts a gentle grip at the back of the mouth, the fruit merging red fruit with black on the finish. What a lovely Pernand-Vergelesses from Chandon de Briailles.",,RP 90
1448,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Les Marechaudes Grand Cru has a detailed nose of brambly red fruit, briary, pressed white flowers and limestone - really captivating aromatics that I hope will be as nuanced and expressive once in bottle. The palate is fresh and vibrant with refined tannin. There is a gentle but persistent grip here, linear at first but opening slightly towards the citrus finish. I would have just liked a little more persistence and flesh, but this remains a very intellectual Corton Marechaudes that may warrant a higher score once in bottle.",,RP 90
1449,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"The 2014 Pernand Vergelesses les Vergelesses 1er Cru, which comes from ferrous clayey soils, has an elegant nose, quite cohesive with brambly red fruit mixed with white flowers and rose petals. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, plenty of citrus fruit and then instead of fanning out, it clams in on the structured finish, suggesting that three years in bottle would be the done thing.",,RP 90
1450,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Grand Cru Blanc,"The 2014 Corton Blanc Grand Cru, which is mainly from Bressandes, has a detailed bouquet with almond and dried quince infusing the citrus fruit, a touch of orange cordial developing behind. The palate is well balanced with quite open and rich tropical-toned fruit, a dab of shaved ginger with a chalky, quite tensile finish. Very fine and a grand cru I suspect will give pleasure early on in its life.",,RP 90
1451,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux,"From the upper part of the vineyard on limestone soils, the 2014 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux has vibrant and quite plush red cherry and crushed strawberry fruit on the open, generous nose. The palate is nicely balanced with a firm backbone. This gently grips the mouth with sappy red berry fruit on the chalky-textured finish. Give this a couple of years in bottle.",,RP 90
1452,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"The 2014 Savigny les Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières comes from south-facing vines and had in fact, already been bottled when I visited the domaine in November. It has a defined, slightly tertiary, loose-knit bouquet that coalesces in the glass, a touch of autumn leaf infusing the brambly red fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, tightly knit at the moment but with a keen thread of acidity and plenty of salinity coming through on the finish. Drink over the next 3-4 years.",,RP 90
1453,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune Village,"From mainly clay soils, the 2014 Savigny les Beaune Villages has an attractive strawberry shortcake nose, hints of ripe cherry - simple but effective. The palate is medium-bodied with steely tannin, taut and linear with a little hardness to address before bottling. But it should turn out to be a fresh, citrus-driven Savigny to enjoy over 3-5 years.",,RP 90
1454,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses Blanc,"The 2014 Pernand Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses has quite a rich, lightly honeyed, tropical-toned bouquet that is nicely defined, a touch of mint developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly waxy opening, touches of grilled walnut and oyster shell coming through, leading to an elegant, probably quite forward finish. So enjoy this as soon as it is in bottle and then over the next 4-5 years.",,RP 90
1455,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru feels a little more nuanced and understated, but more complex with more minerality than the Corton Maréchaudes. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe black cherry, pomegranate and blackcurrant fruit with a shard of flint toward the finish. This is very harmonious, beautifully focused with a sophisticated finish that attests to the pedigree of this vineyard. This would be my pick of Chandon de Briailles 2013s.",,RP 90
1456,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton les Maréchaudes Grand Cru, which sees around 20% new oak, has a cohesive, blackcurrant and blueberry-scented bouquet with just a hint of baking powder. The palate is medium-bodied with a harmonious, silky texture, moderate depth with good precision toward the finish. It feels sappy in the mouth with its salinity urging another sip and it should drink well over the next 8-10 years.",,RP 90
1457,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Grand Cru Blanc,"The 2013 Corton Blanc actually comes from mainly Corton Bressandes, with 10% from Corton les Chaumes. The nose is clean and fresh with beeswax and yellow flower scents that just need to develop more complexity. The palate is medium-bodied with hints of custard crème and nougat on the entry, nicely judged acidity with a harmonious, slightly nutty finish that fans out gently, but does not wish to exert great length. Enjoy this over the next 4-6 years.",,RP 90
1458,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru comes from a parcel at the top of the vineyard. It has a somewhat airy, cold stone bouquet that is perhaps less expressive than the Corton-Bressandes at this early juncture. The palate is medium-bodied, the tannins a little chewier than the aforementioned Bressandes, with a linear, marine-influenced, very minerally finish that feels a little abrupt. Give this a couple of years in bottle and hopefully it will achieve the same class as the Corton-Bressandes.",,RP 90
1459,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux,"The 2013 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux comes from the upper part of the vineyard with more chalk and limestone soils. It has a crisp, well-defined bouquet that is more elegant than the village cru, more refined albeit with a similar fruit profile. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin: fresh and lithe in the mouth, well-judged acidity and a lucid blackberry and bilberry finish that is a joy. This is a fine success in not an easy vintage.",,RP 90
1460,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 2013 Pernand Vergelesses Ile de Vergelesses comes from their 4-hectare parcel (three red and one hectare white). This has a stonier nose than the premier cru Vergelesses, with granite aromas infusing the black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with a little more succulence than the Vergelesses, nicely judged acidity with a slight hardness on the sappy finish that hopefully will soften by the time of bottling. If that happens then this would be a fine, classic Pernand-Vergelesses.",,RP 90
1461,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"The 2013 Aloxe Corton (les Valozieres), from just under Bressandes, come from 0.38-hectares of vine. It has a slightly sulky bouquet at first: mulberry and wild hedgerow, subtle cold stone scents loitering in the wings. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, slightly chalky tannin, a keen thread of acidity and concludes with a structured, quite masculine finish. It does not possess enormous length but it should evolve into a refreshing Aloxe-Corton to drink over the next 4-6 years.",,RP 90
1462,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"The 2013 Savigny les Beaune les Lavieres, which comes from Aux Fournaux (not mentioned on the label) and sees no new wood, has a light, crisp and clean bouquet with blackcurrant and briary scents. The palate has a citric entry with slight chalky tannin, quite masculine in style, but displaying commendable energy toward the terse, almost stoic, dark berry finish. This should drink well for 3 or 4 years once it is bottled.",,RP 90
1463,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"The 2013 Pernand Vergelesses les Vergelesses 1er Cru has a slightly withdrawn bouquet with blackberry and undergrowth scents laced with cold black tea. It unfolds nicely in the glass but never fully lets go. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, crunchy tannin. I like the structure here, but there is just a slight greenness just poking its head out on the finish.",,RP 90
1464,Domaine Chandon de Briailles,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The 2011 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile des Vergelesses comes from their 3.13 hectares of vines that average around 40 years in age. It has an expressive bouquet with abundant red cherries and raspberry preserve scents intermixed with hints of wet tobacco. The palate offers fine depth on the entry and good structure. There is a palpable sense of tension here, although a more benevolent season would have bestowed greater persistency. Drink now-2018.

It has a well-defined nose with dried herbs infusing the red plum and cranberry fruit. Yes, it is slightly leafy, but it is well defined and poised. The palate is medium-bodied with dry tannins. There is a little hardness here, although the judicious dash of black pepper on the finish is welcome. This premier cru just needs to loosen up in bottle. Drink 2016-2023.

The palate is medium-bodied with a crisp, chalky entry – tart red cherry fruit, strawberry and a dash of spice toward the finish that compensates for the recalcitrant nose. Give this a year or two in bottle to sort itself out.

The palate is medium-bodied with a saline tang on the entry. There is good substance and presence in the mouth with a surprisingly weight finish that suggests it will age nicely. Bold and brassy!

1525,Etienne Sauzet,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Mme.  de Nicolay was kind enough to open a bottle of the 1996 Corton-Charlemagne, a wine I had only tasted from barrel.  Spiced pears, minerals, and toasted oak were evident in its aromatics.  On the palate it offered a dense core of mouth-coating minerals and gravel.  This rich yet highly structured wine is extremely tight at present (as are most 1996s) and will require considerable cellaring patience.  Anticipated maturity: 2003-2010.

1526,Etienne Sauzet,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"Medium-to-dark ruby colored, and displaying stony, metallic, and blackberry aromatics, the Corton Clos du Roi is a medium-to-full-bodied, structured, masculine, ripe wine that is packed with cassis, brambleberries and stones. Somewhat austere and foursquare, this complex and aristocratic wine is well-concentrated and possesses a persistent, well-defined finish. Intricate and complex, refined, structured, and classy.  Projected maturity: 2002-2008.",,RP 89+
1527,Etienne Sauzet,Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru,"The ruby-colored Corton-Bressandes offers a beguiling nose of sweet red fruits, wild mushrooms, and underbrush-like scents. This rich, oily-textured, dense, powerful, medium-to-full-bodied, and deep wine is jam-packed with layers of candied blackberries, cassis, stones, and minerals. I tasted this wine from two barrels, the younger cask revealed traces of Asian spices and the older barrique touches of chalk, and dried smoky minerals. Both casks contain a wine of admirable depth, purity, and length. Projected maturity: 2000-2006.",,RP 89+
1528,Etienne Sauzet,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"Medium-to-dark ruby/purple-colored and exhibiting black raspberry and cassis aromas, the Corton Les Marechaudes is a supple, fat, feminine, medium-bodied, and velvety-textured wine. Sweet, juicy cherries are intermingled with minerals and stones in this pleasing, expressive, and long wine. Immensely satisfying yet not intensely complex or long.

1529,Etienne Sauzet,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile de Vergelesses,"The Pernand-Vergelesses Ile de Vergelesses displays a healthy ruby/purple color and earthy black fruit aromas. This medium-to-full-bodied, rich, intense, focused, chewy-textured, yet vibrant wine is packed with flavors suggestive of ripe black cherries and sauteed porcini mushrooms.

1530,Etienne Sauzet,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Lavières,"From 40 year old vines, the ruby-colored Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Lavieres has lively blackberry and smoky aromas.

It would have received higher praise had it not had an abrupt finish. Anticipated maturity: 1999-2004.",,RP 89+
1531,Etienne Sauzet,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"Revealing a bright ruby color and a nose of deeply rich dark fruits, earth, minerals, and mushrooms, the Pernand-Vergelesses Les Vergelesses is a medium-bodied, creamy-textured, and succulent wine filled with beautifully ripe red cherries. This expressive wine will provide delicious near term drinking, but it lacks the necessary structure for extended cellaring. Drink it over the next 3-4 years.",,RP 89+
1532,Etienne Sauzet,Aloxe-Corton 1er Cru Les Valozières,"This ruby-colored, violet and blueberry-scented wine offers a medium-bodied, structured, and tannic core of red grapes, stones, and earth-like flavors. Its lack of density and short finish suggest it will only be labeled as an Aloxe-Corton. Drink it between 1999 and 2003.

Produced from vines planted a decade ago, the Aloxe-Corton is entitled to premier cru status as it hails from Les Valozieres. In recent years, however, Mme. de Nicolay, a proud and quality conscious woman, has refused to label it as such because the wines, in her opinion, lacked premier cru quality. Whether the 1996 will be labeled as a village wine or as an Aloxe-Corton Les Valozieres will be determined at the time of bottling.",,RP 89+
1533,Etienne Sauzet,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Aux Fournaux,"The ruby-colored and earth, blackberry, and mineral-scented Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Fourneaux was produced from 40 year old vines.

1536,Etienne Sauzet,Corton Les Maréchaudes Grand Cru,"Of the three Cortons, the 1994 Corton Marechaudes and 1994 Corton Bressandes are far more precocious and flattering than the 1994 Corton Clos du Roi. The Corton Marechaudes is sweet and evolved, with a medium ruby color, copious amounts of cherry and vanillin-like aromas and flavors, medium body, a lush, soft texture, and a heady finish. It is a mouthfilling, silky style of red Burgundy to drink over the next 6-8 years. I have tasted many a pathetic 1994 red Burgundy that was shallow, thin, and harsh, but producers who kept their crop size reasonable, and did not excessively process the wines, had the potential to produce soft, delicious, seductive red Burgundies that will not make old bones, but can offer charming drinking over the next 5-6 years. Having made many visits to Domaine Chandon de Briailles, I was always disappointed that so much fining and filtration took place. Finally, Daniel Johnnes was able to convince this estate to bottle the 1994s with no filtration. And guess what? These are seductive, round, ample red Burgundies with plenty of up-front fruit. None of these offerings reveals any of the hardness or dilution that is one of the hallmarks of so many 1994 red Burgundies.

1538,Etienne Sauzet,Corton Clos du Roi Grand Cru,"Among the three Cortons, the 1994 Corton Clos du Roi is clearly the most backward and structured. While it exhibits a deep ruby color, and plenty of toasty oak in the nose, the wine is closed, moderately tannic, and in need of 1-2 years of cellaring. There are gobs of concentrated fruit, but it is all bound up in the wine's tannin. It will benefit from another 12-18 months of cellaring and should last for a decade.

Drinking beautifully, it should last another 5-6 years. I am confident this wine would exhibit even more complexity and richness if this domaine would throw away their filters.

1581,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières En la Richarde,"Wafting from the glass with scents of orange oil, white flowers, spices and honeycomb, the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières En la Richarde is medium to full-bodied, textural and aromatic, its broad and enveloping attack segueing into a fleshy, lively mid-palate, concluding with a long, saline finish.",,RP 91
1582,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of green pear, peach, orange oil, white flowers and nutmeg, the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes is full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a rich core of concentrated fruit, lively acids and muscular structure, concluding with a long, saline finish. This is a powerful but reserved Combettes that's the most introspective of these Sauzet wines.",,RP 91
1583,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"Unfurling in the glass with aromas of crisp white peach, grapefruit pith, white flowers and subtle hints of orange blossom, the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny is medium to full-bodied, tensile and incisive, with good concentration at the core, racy acids and a long finish with good grip. This is one of the more precise and less fleshy 2017s from Sauzet this year, showing its higher-altitude origins, and that marks it out as a particular success.",,RP 91
1584,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"Unfurling in the glass with aromas of wheat toast, crisp green orchard fruit, white peach and subtle hints of nutmeg, as well as a touch of youthful struck match, Sauzet's 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne is medium to full-bodied, satiny but incisive, with a lively but envelopingly textural profile, excellent concentration and tension at the core, and a long, delicately chalky finish. This saw a very judicious 25% new wood and is shaping up to be one of the finest renditions of this cuvée that I've tasted.",,RP 91
1585,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Benoît Riffault's 2017 Puligny-Montrachet Village is already open and expressive on the nose, wafting from the glass with aromas of ripe lemons, Anjou pear, nutmeg, dried white flowers and warm bread. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with a satiny attack, excellent amplitude and concentration at the core, ripe acids and a long, expansive finish. This is quite a powerful example of the vintage, but don't let its youthful precocity deceive, as it has the structure and substance to evolve gracefully in the cellar.",,RP 91
1586,Etienne Sauzet,Beaune 1er Cru Les Pertuisots,"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Les Pertuisots offers up a pretty nose of crisp green orchard fruit, citrus zest, blanched almonds and fresh peach. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and incisive, with good depth at the core, racy acids and a delicately chalky finish. This is a classy, beautifully balanced Pertuisots that isn't as rich and sun-kissed as some of Sauzet's more dramatic cuvées this year.",,RP 91
1587,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Beaune Jardin du Calvaire,"The 2017 Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Beaune Jardin du Calvaire offers up a reserved bouquet of crisp, minty green orchard fruit, toasted nuts and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's medium-bodied, tense and racy, with less flesh and concentration than Sauzet's higher appellations in this vintage.",,RP 91
1588,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Blanc,"Offering up aromas of fresh peach, grapefruit, wheat toast and nutmeg, Sauzet's 2017 Bourgogne Blanc is medium-bodied, satiny-textured and open-knit, with ripe acids, moderate concentration and a stony finish. It's creditable enough, but it represents an appreciable step down from the qualitative level attained by the domaine's communal-and-higher appellation bottlings this year.",,RP 91
1589,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes is exceptional, unfurling in the glass with a classy bouquet of hazelnut cream, ripe lemon and pear. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and concentrated, with chewy extract and considerable depth at the core, blanched by bright, tangy acids. This was a terrific showing for Sauzet.",,RP 91
1590,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières also put in a solid performance, displaying scents of ripe citrus, white flowers, crushed chalk and struck match, with some nicely integrated creamy new oak in the background. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, tense and bright, with a tangy line of acidity and a mouthwatering, focused finish. With some more bottle age, it could be even better—assuming it ages consistently.",,RP 91
1591,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet,"Tasted blind, Sauzet's 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet was showing well, displaying a classy bouquet of spring flowers, grapefruit and crisp white peach. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, glossy and bright, with a layered mid-palate, racy acids and a pure, delicately stony finish.",,RP 91
1592,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"A reserved bouquet of confit lemon, tangerine oil, dried white flowers and frangipane leads into an elegantly glossy, full-bodied wine with a bright spine of acidity, good depth at the core and impressive tension and grip on the moderate finish. This is a really creditable showing for Sauzet's 1994 Puligny-Montrachet Village.",,RP 91
1593,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was not too affected by frost according to Benoît, as the vines were partly protected by the wall that runs along the top of the vineyard toward Montrachet. It has a well-defined bouquet with expressive scents of green apple, fresh pear and a slight touch of mint, conveying a sense of coiled-up energy and frisson. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, just a little honeyed in texture with quite an intense, spicy finish that leaves you with a positive impression. You know what...this might well turn out to be the best wine from Sauzet this year. Bravo.",,RP 91
1594,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Montrachet Grand Cru comes from purchased fruit that was cropped at eight hectoliters per hectare and filled two barrels, one new and the other one year old. It has a clean and fresh bouquet, quite conservative, maybe missing the bravura of the Chevalier or the class of the Bâtard. The palate is fresh and quite intense on the entry with spicy citrus fruit laced with orang zest, even a tang of marmalade. This becomes more complex as it goes on, and certainly the aftertaste feels very long, the mouth tingling 60 seconds after it has departed. This is a very fine white Burgundy rather than a superlative Montrachet at this early juncture.",,RP 91
1595,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières was the only premier cru touched by frost and quantity was consequently reduced by 50%. That does not appear to have compromised the fragrant nose with scents of white flowers and a hint of aniseed. The palate is well balanced with a fresh entry, quite full in the mouth with quince and nectarine towards the spicy, feisty finish. Perhaps one of the most expressive of Sauzet’s 2016s in its youth, nevertheless it will age well. This is perhaps the most personality-driven of Sauzet's 2016s.",,RP 91
1596,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru was touched by the frost so that there are just two barrels instead of four. It turns the amp up on the Bâtard-Montrachet with even more expressive, mint-tinged citrus fruit complemented by scents of quince and passion fruit. There is just a slight hint of VA but nothing much. The palate is very well balanced with a ripe, saline entry, good weight in the mouth and a slightly rounded, dense finish that just misses the precision of either the 2014 or 2015, or even the detail of the Bâtard-Montrachet. Let's see how this evolves in bottle because at the moment the Bâtard-Montrachet is a couple of furlongs ahead (at least in barrel).",,RP 91
1597,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny has a more convincing bouquet than the Champ Gain at this stage, demonstrating better harmony and more lifted green apple and blackcurrant leaf notes. The palate is very well balanced with orange pith and citrus lemon on the entry. This builds nicely in the mouth and the finish exhibits fine cohesion and sappiness. This is a very commendable, delicious follow-up to the impressive 2015 last year.",,RP 91
1598,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières did not quite display the panache of the enticing Les Referts, though it is redeemed by a subtle touch of aniseed, a leitmotif among several other whites within the Côte de Beaune. The palate is very well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, crisp and taut, perhaps less showy and complex than the Les Referts, although there is plenty of freshness on the finish. If you want a strict, no-frills, straight-onto-the-fairway Puligny, this is where to come.",,RP 91
1599,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1e Cru Les Referts has a tightly wound, more tertiary bouquet than the Hameau de Blagny. It gradually opens and offers scents of cold steel and flint scents, distant and a bit aloof. The palate is very refined with a keen thread of acidity, nicely focused with a saline, quite precise finish that lingers in the mouth. This is another fine premier cru from Sauzet that should age with style and may end up at the top of my banded score.",,RP 91
1600,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne was not affected by frost and consequently enjoyed similar yields as 2015, among the highest of Sauzet’s 2016s. The nose is elegant and stylish with apple blossom, brioche and hazelnut scents that lean a little toward Meursault. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, sappy in the mouth with a crisp if just slightly abrupt, slate-like finish. Good potential and I suspect it will put on weight in bottle.",,RP 91
1601,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes has a clean and precise bouquet with cold stone and flint aromas, great articulation of the terroir here with underlying hints of orange pith and pink grapefruit. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, waxy in texture with a fine sense of drive, yet I would have liked to see more complexity and mineral expression towards the finish that just lets the side down here. Let’s see if it improves in bottle.",,RP 91
1602,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet is more in line with the La Perrière: a strict, no-frills bouquet with flint and cut grass aromas. The palate is well balanced with a slightly waxy texture. This is a more resinous Puligny from Sauzet in 2016, more about the texture than overt fruit expression, although it lets its hair down with that dash of white pepper on the aftertaste. My intuition is that it might be one of the more forward wines from the domaine this year. Not bad, however, not as good as the 2015 last year.",,RP 91
1603,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Truffiere,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Truffières is much more expressive and ripe on the nose with yellow plum, jasmine and peach skin aromas. To be honest, I rather prefer the stricter aromatics on the Les Referts. The palate is full in the mouth with just a faint suggestion of tropical fruit on the entry, but then it tapers in and becomes more “Puligny-like” in its final third. This Truffières needs to make up its mind about what it wants to be, and at this nascent stage, it had not manifested the harmony of flow of its siblings.",,RP 91
1604,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet Village has a fresh minty bouquet that is a step or two up from the Bourgogne Blanc as you would expect. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp tannin, citrus-driven with Granny Smith apples and a touch of pear on the slightly short and steely finish. Drink over the next 4 or 5 years.",,RP 91
1605,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2016 Bourgogne Blanc, which had just been fined, has a clean and fresh bouquet with hints of brioche and apple blossom. The palate is simple with light grassy green fruit and moderate weight, but it feels a little skinny (even for a generic white Burgundy) toward the finish. Drink over the next 2 or 3 years.",,RP 91
1606,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain has a rather surly, undergrowth, almost mulch-like bouquet. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, taut and linear with a slightly shallow, rather lean finish that needs to forage more substance by the time of bottling. I will reserve judgement and giving a score for the time being.",,RP 91
1607,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Sauzet's 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Combettes has a crisp, lively, cold stone/limestone and grilled walnut-scented bouquet that lends it a Meursault-like personality. There is certainly impressive vigor in situ. The palate is very saline on the entry with fine acidity and very good depth—a quintessential Puligny-Montrachet that is lightly spiced and comes armed with an unsubtle but powerful finish that lingers.",,RP 91
1608,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru Champ Canet,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Sauzet's 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru Champ Canet has a slight reduction on the nose, a very light ash-like scent behind the citrus fruit, grass clippings and perhaps a touch of mulch. The palate is well balanced with grapefruit and a touch of lime on the entry. There is good depth to this Puligny, although it does not deliver the tension and mineralité of the best wines. Conservative? Maybe, although it is still thoughtfully made.",,RP 91
1609,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is a vintage that I omitted during my Burgundy tasting. I missed out because here it out-flanked the Montrachet from Sauzet. It has developed a complex bouquet with apple blossom, hazelnut and a soupcon of cold granite. I appreciate the drive and intensity of the Chevalier-Montrachet. The palate is lively with superb precision, offering the crescendo you expect from this vineyard. It is still primal yet there is impressive energy and nervosité that will stand it in good stead for long-term aging. This is an excellent Chevalier-Montrachet from Sauzet that should repay bottle aging. Tasted October 2016.",,RP 91
1610,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Montrachet Grand Cru was showing more oak on the nose compared to the other crus, probably because it is limited to a single barrel so there are no ""non new oak"" options available. Underneath that veneer lies red apples, dried honey and a touch of nutmeg. The palate is ripe and honeyed, quite forward compared to its peers with fine weight in the mouth, albeit missing the tension and mineralité of its Chevalier-Montrachet counterpart. There is a nice fatness in situ, but it does not quite deliver the sophistication of the Chevalier-Montrachet and is more on par (not superior) with the Bâtard-Montachet. Tasted October 2016.",,RP 91
1611,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru put in a very creditable showing against Sauzet's three other grand crus. It has a linear and taut, mineral bouquet with that floral aspect emerging with time, though here I observed more ""yellow"" flowers than ""white."" The palate is fresh and vibrant with very good tension throughout, pretty and seeming to have gained some persistence on the finish since I tasted it in Beaune a couple of years ago. Yes, an elegant 2011 from Sauzet that appears to be improving with time in bottle. Tasted October 2016.",,RP 91
1612,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was a little subdued on the nose with faint scents of green apple, granite and flint, but missing the same intensity and ambition as the Bâtard-Montrachet. The palate has a low-key entry—it does not want to create too much of a fuss. But it soon gets its act together thanks to a welcome twist of bitter lemon and a spicy vein towards the understated finish. If it were a child in a choir, you would be encouraging them to ""sing louder."" Tasted October 2016.",,RP 91
1613,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, the 2010 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is developing an attractive bouquet with melted wax, resinous aromas with hints of dried honey and a faint whiff of French patisserie. The palate is showing good depth and vigor, quite spicy with hints of honey and quince showing up towards the second half. It is an extrovert Chevalier-Montrachet for sure, more cocksure than the 2011 perhaps, although it trips over its shoelaces on the finish that does not quite deliver the length to back up its bravado. Still, it is a thoroughly enjoyable grand cru that should give 12-15 years of drinking pleasure. Tasted October 2016.",,RP 91
1614,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a powerful, almost show-stopping bouquet with intense yellow plum, Mirabelle and grey slate-like aromas that are beautifully defined. The palate is very well balanced, harnessing the richness of the growing season by keeping a tight rein thanks to the terroir. Great depth here, superb acidity and the finish is very complex, with hints of almond and grilled walnut on the persistent finish. This is an impressive Chevalier-Montrachet that represents a very worthy follow-up to the 2014.",,RP (93-95)
1615,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny has a lively, granitic, slightly smoke-scented bouquet that delivers a little more energy compared to the Champs Gain. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, plenty of slate-tinged citrus fruit with a composed, very focused finish that fans out with confidence. This is a great Puligny from Benoît and it comes highly recommended.",,RP (93-95)
1616,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a more reserved and conservative bouquet compared to the Bienvenue, with dew-speckled Granny Smith apples, grass clipping, wet granite aromas unfolding in the glass but never letting go completely. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, a little more tension and race than the Bienvenue yet displaying that same spicy, but here more saline finish that fans out with confidence. Excellent - this is very elegant.",,RP (93-95)
1617,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2015 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières, which comes from the lieu-dit ""en Richard"" (though never stated on the label), offers appealing aromas of green apple, slate and a touch of blackberry leaf, gaining intensity with each swirl of the glass. The palate is crisp and fresh on the entry with a fine line of acidity. It has a sense of harmony and composure perhaps missing in the La Perriere, with impressive mineralité and tension on the finish. This comes recommended.",,RP (93-95)
1618,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru, which comes from purchased fruit from the Chassagne side, was taken from barrel since it underwent a very slow malolactic fermentation according to winemaker Benîot Riffault. To be honest, it has a hard time following the Chevalier Montrachet, not nearly as expressive and without the mineralité shown by the vines located further up in the incline. The palate is actually more expressive with very fine tension, quite intense with palpable salinity, with a sense of energy. There is genuine weight and presence on the finish here and the aftertaste is very long, yet the action seems to reside with the Chevalier-Montrachet this season.",,RP (93-95)
1619,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts comes from relatively clayey soils that are cooler and keep the acidity in the wine. It has a delicate bouquet at first, but soon shifts into a higher gear with scents of citrus fruit, dried yellow flowers and fumé aromas. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with orange rind and hints of apricot, the acidity nicely judged with impressive harmony and tension on the finish. There is a natural swagger to this Les Referts that I hope will be intact once bottled. Excellent.",,RP (93-95)
1620,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montachet Grand Cru has quite an intense bouquet with wet limestone and light fumé scents, candied orange peel emerging after several swirls of the glass. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry, nectarine and yellow plum, hints of hazelnut and grilled pine nuts infusing the citrus fruit that dovetails into an edgy, stem ginger tinged finish that lingers long in the mouth. This should develop into an accomplished Bienvenue, even if it will not rank amongst the very finest from the estate.",,RP (93-95)
1621,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Truffiere,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Les Truffières captures the trademark tropical scents of the vintage: fresh pineapple, passion fruit and a hint of white peach, whilst neatly avoiding any sense of blowsiness or overpowering sensations. The palate is harmonious with a smooth texture, notes of toffee apple, lemon curd and walnut segueing into a finish that feels a little richer than the 2014 last year, but thankfully it maintains fine balance. Whilst the Puligny Hameau de Blagny seems a little more effortless, this remains a fine proposition.",,RP (93-95)
1622,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain offers crisp Granny Smith apples and dewy pasture scents on the nose, reserved at first but opening nicely in the glass. The palate is fresh and crisp with a pleasant fatness in the mouth. It is a Champs Gain laden with both weight and presence, hints of walnut and spice towards the finish that like the La Garenne, just needs a little more energy and tension to evolve.",,RP (93-95)
1623,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne has an elegant bouquet with hints of white flower permeating the citrus fruit, certainly a level up from the village cru in terms of complexity. The palate is balanced with light peachy notes on the entry. There is good depth and a fine line of acidity, hints of almond developing towards the satisfying if slightly conservative finish.",,RP (93-95)
1624,Etienne Sauzet,Hautes Côtes de Beaune Blanc,"The maiden 2015 Hautes Côtes de Beaune Blanc comes from an acquisition of 4.5 hectares close to Nolay located in a small valley but at 450 meters altitude. It has a cold terroir which is what Benîot and his team were seeking. I do find more vigor and intensity on the nose compared to the Bourgogne Blanc for this has a spring in its step. The palate is fresh and vibrant with fine salinity, nicely poised with a touch of citrus peel on the long, grapefruit and melon-tinged finish. This is well worth seeking out.",,RP (93-95)
1625,Etienne Sauzet,Chassagne Montrachet Enceignieres,"The 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet Enceignieres, from vines close to Bâtard-Montrachet, has a reserved, stony, Puligny-like bouquet that opens nicely in the glass, just a hint of blackberry leaf developing after 3-4 minutes. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, very taut and linear with a dash of spice towards the finish. It perhaps just lacks a little charm at the moment, but hopefully that will develop with time in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1626,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet Village has a light, grass clipping-tinged bouquet that feels a little reserved at the moment. There's a bit of inertia here. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, taut and linear, yet just needing to develop more intensity and mineralité towards the finish. It just needs a little more terroir expression.",,RP (93-95)
1627,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2015 Bourgogne Blanc, matured in four-year-old barrels, has a slightly smudged, quite primal bouquet that needs to show a little more energy. The palate is crisp on the entry with good acidity, although the finish felt a little anonymous compared to some of its peers. Drink over the next couple of years.",,RP (93-95)
1628,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet has a precise and more mineral-driven bouquet compared to its peers. There is just the right amount of aloofness here, but it keeps drawing you in. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, maybe some botrytis here and it shaves away some (but not all) of the precision on the finish. However, I appreciate the harmony and depth of this Puligny and it should age nicely over the next 10-12 years. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1629,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes perhaps has a touch of under-ripeness on the nose -- bruised apple intermingling with cold slate-like scents. The palate is quite powerful, missing the nuance of Vincent Girardin's own Les Combettes, though it is still balanced and generates momentum towards the spicy, almost oily-textured finish. Though it does not match my expectations from barrel, I suspect that this will improve with another couple of years in bottle. Tasted May 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1630,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru takes a few swirls of the glass to really get going, eventually developing subtle peardrop and nectarine notes that patiently wait behind the stony veneer. The palate is crisp and fresh on the entry with a fine line of acidity, brisk and lively, hints of peach and pineapple coming through on the seductive and flattering finish that has plenty of roundness. This is just gorgeous, but it needs several years in the cellar. ",,RP (93-95)
1631,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Montrachet Grand Cru has an aristocratic bouquet, serious, like the older brother of the Bâtard-Montrachet, hints of almond and white tea, dried lemon peel emerging with time. The palate is fresh and vibrant with crisp acidity, wonderful harmony, hints of walnut and white pepper interlacing the intense finish. It's not quite as flattering as the Chevalier at the moment, but the persistence is more sustained. It is a serious Montrachet that deserves time in the cellar. ",,RP (93-95)
1632,Etienne Sauzet,Batard Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru, which comes from the Puligny side of the vineyard, has a palpable sea breeze tincture on the nose that is joined by almond and grilled walnut with time. The palate is fresh on the entry and is perhaps a little more viscous than its peers. Ergo there is satisfying density here, a powerful, confident Bâtard with chutzpah, though it does not quite deliver the sophistication on the finish...at least not at this early juncture.",,RP (93-95)
1633,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Truffiere,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Truffière has a very slight reductive note, touches of walnut and smoke coming through, later a mote of apricot blossom. The palate is well defined with a strong saline entry. There is good density here, a powerful Truffières with a lovely sharp citric twist animating the finish. Just two barrels produced this year but it is worth seeking long 'n hard for.",,RP (93-95)
1634,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Champ Gain has a reserved and elegant bouquet, hints of citrus lemon and oyster shell reluctantly emerging in the glass, timid but gaining confidence with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a little more exotic, by which I mean prettier with passion fruit and apricot, but still with fine mineralité. The acidity here drives this Puligny along with a twist of bitter lemon on the saline finish. This should give much pleasure over the next 10-15 years.",,RP (93-95)
1635,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1Er Cru les Perrieres,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Perrières has a terroir-driven, mineral-rich bouquet, flint and cold limestone. The palate is fresh and saline on the entry, good density here with a little more spiciness than Sauzet's other premier crus. There is an edginess here, tensile and animated with impressive weight on the finish. This is very fine and probably deserves 2-3 years in the cellar. This is one of the domaine's best premier crus in 2014.",,RP (93-95)
1636,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatieres,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières is much more aloof on the nose compared to the nascent les Perrières, doesn't quite get out of second gear. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a keen thread of acidity and goes some way to make up for the sulkiness of the aromatics. Especially towards the finish, where it delivers Meursault-like hazelnut and walnut notes. Give this 3-4 years in bottle and it should rise phoenix-like.",,RP (93-95)
1637,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenue Batard Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was somewhat reticent on the nose, less flattering than its counterpart that I tasted chez Domaine Leflaive earlier that same day. The palate is taut and crisp, tightly coiled, quite spicy like the Combettes with a dash of white pepper towards the long finish. It is a reserved Bienvenue but it will repay cellaring. Just two barrels produced. ",,RP (93-95)
1638,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Referts,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Referts has a similar bouquet to the 2014 Hameau de Blagny, but with slightly more greener fruit, kiwi and Granny Smith apples. The palate is vibrant on the entry. There is good weight here, harmonious and focused, gaining weight on the citrus-driven finish with hints of nectarine and pear on the aftertaste. This fans out nicely after a modest beginning and I suspect it will reside at the top of my estimate once in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1639,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet Villages,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet Villages, which comes from the same 12 parcels from north to south of the appellation as in previous years, has a lively bouquet that has more personality than the Chassagne Enceignières - light oyster shell scents coming through with aeration. The palate is well balanced with vibrant acidity, crisp and taut with a lively, green apple and fresh nectarine finish. Nice length here and nicely composed, this would be my preference over the Chassagne Villages this year. ",,RP (93-95)
1640,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne was missing a bit of substance on the nose when I tasted it at the domaine, though with modest encouragement it opens up to deliver hints of citrus fruit. This just did not quite express the terroir as other of Sauzet's premier crus. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry, the oak just rounding this out rather, hints of toffee apple and peach surfacing towards the poised finish. It actually finished better than it begins, so let's see what it can do once in bottle. ",,RP (93-95)
1641,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"The 2014 Puligny-Montachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny has a very subtle scent of rosewater on the nose - pretty, if missing a little complexity. The palate is nicely balanced but does not quite have the breeding, the sophistication of the 2014 Champ Gain. It coalesces nicely towards the finish, though I would be tempted to broach this earlier than its peers. ",,RP (93-95)
1642,Etienne Sauzet,Chassagne Montrachet Enceignieres,"The 2014 Chassagne-Montrachet Enceignières is raised in used barrel with 15% new oak. It is quite austere on the nose with light, flinty scents. The palate is fresh on the entry with brisk and breezy green apple and pear. Steely in style, more like a Puligny in style with a reserved finish, I would enjoy this over the next five years.",,RP (93-95)
1643,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2014 Bourgogne Blanc comes from three different plots and is matured in four-year-old oak barrels, and had been bottled in August. It has a light and crisp bouquet with green apples, quite malic in style. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity, light and agreeable with an easy-drinking finish. ",,RP (93-95)
1644,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain is very reserved and mineral-driven on the nose that appears to have closed up since bottling. The palate is citrus-fresh on the entry with well-integrated oak, just a slight honeyed note toward the hazelnut finish that lingers long in the mouth, that tang of dried orange peel begging you to take another sip. This is a superb Puligny-Montrachet from the Domaine but it needs a couple more years bottle age.",,RP (93-95)
1645,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Tasted blind at Farr Vintners Kumeu/White Burgundy tasting. The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet from Etienne Sauzet has a very pleasant reduction on the nose: real mineralité here, intense and convincing, the kind of aromatics that take you by the lapels and demand attention. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, fresh and complex with a lovely saline element toward the finish. For a village cru Burgundy this punches above its weight and is well worth seeking out.",,RP (93-95)
1646,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"Tasted blind at Farr Vintners Kumeu/White Burgundy tasting. The 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Hameau de Blagny from Etienne Sauzet has a lanolin and beeswax-infused bouquet that gently unfolds in the glass, though it is not quite as detailed as its peers. The palate is well balanced with an expressive opening: walnut, dried orange peel and shaved ginger notes. There is fine depth here with a slightly tangy, marmalade-tinged finish, although it does not have the complexity of its peers. Drink over the next two or three years.",,RP (93-95)
1647,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a brooding intensity on the nose: citrus peel, wet stone (more granitic than the Bâtard-Montrachet at this stage), accompanied by subtle scents of white chocolate and brioche. The palate is fresh and vibrant with well-executed acidity, gradually building to another marine-influenced finish that lingers long and tenderly in the mouth. Is it better than the outstanding Bâtard-Montrachet? Let’s wait and see… ",,RP (93-95)
1648,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is more expressive on the nose than the Bienvenue at the moment, offering cold wet limestone and Granny Smith apple scents. There is certainly good intensity here. The palate is fresh and vibrant with finely tuned acidity, superb mineral concentration with splendid weight and length on the finish. For me, this is a cut above the Bienvenue this year and on par with last year's Bâtard-Montrachet.",,RP (93-95)
1649,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru, of which there are four barrels this year, has a bashful nose at first, a king demanding coaxing from his chamber! There are certainly good mineral notes here, although I feel that the Bâtard-Montrachet is more complex at the moment. The palate is more regal with finely tuned acidity, reserved at the moment with tangible stony, almost flinty notes developing toward the peacock’s tail finish. This is very fine, but I actually think the Bâtard-Montrachet will give it a run for its money. However, I am more impressed by the 2013 than the 2012 last year.",,RP (93-95)
1650,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Perrières has a straight-laced, correct and linear bouquet without the frills of the les Referts. The palate is crisp and more malic than Sauzet’s other premier crus on the entry with dewy Granny Smith apples, freshly sliced pear and orange zest, the finish more austere, but long and “stony” in the mouth. This should be afforded three of four years in bottle because there is good substance within.",,RP (93-95)
1651,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Referts has a poised, tightly wound bouquet with hints of blackberry leaf and licorice suggesting that post-bottling, this might turn out to be spicy little number. Nothing wrong with that! The palate is crisp and taut on the entry with a steeliness coming through with aeration, then it lets go during the second half with citrus lemon, orange zest, freshly squeezed lime and a long minerally finish. This is one of the more mercurial Puligny's from Sauzet - very intriguing.",,RP (93-95)
1652,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gain, from their parcel just before you arrive at La Truffières, has a pretty orange sorbet and apricot-scented bouquet: vivacious if not as intense as the Hameau de Blagny ’13. The palate is clean and crisp with razor-sharp acidity, a little “pointed” towards the rocky finish, when you expect it to fan out, although I am sure by the time of bottling it will have developed more substance. Still, this is a very assured Champs Gain in the making.",,RP (93-95)
1653,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Truffière,"There are two barrels of the rarely seen 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Truffière. In fact, it has never been reviewed by this publication and in any case, last year's was reduced to a single barrel because of hail. It comes from vines located on the boundary with Champ Gain. It has a more sophisticated and complex nose compared to the Folatieres, with lifted mineral scents. The palate is fresh and crisp, taut on the entry with steely acidity, correct and a little austere, but with plenty of length. Fine, if just missing the ""X-factor"" of say, the Combettes or Les Referts.",,RP (93-95)
1654,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is very reserved, you could almost say “timid” on the nose at the moment, reticent to say the least. The palate is taut and crisp with notes of Granny Smith apple, citrus lemon and a touch of spice. It begins to lose its inhibitions toward the saline, sour lemon-tinged finish. Certainly this will deserve four or five years in bottle, but I wonder whether it will surpass Benoît's best premier crus in 2013?",,RP (93-95)
1655,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Hameau de Blagny (whose paltry 100 liters of 2012 was blended into the village cru last year) has an attractive bouquet with delicate touches of orange blossom and citrus peel, the mineral scents only revealed after some encouragement. The palate is well balanced with touches of apricot and quince on the entry. The acidity is nicely judged and there is more weight and concentration on the finish compared to the la Garenne. Very fine but one I would broach before its fellow premier crus.",,RP (93-95)
1656,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet has a clean and crisp, quite stony and perhaps reserved bouquet compared to the 2012 last year. The palate is crisp and taut, already demonstrating impressive weight in the mouth, leading to a well-defined finish with a hint of fish oil, something almost “Thai” on the finish. Very fine and there's personality here. ",,RP (93-95)
1657,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru la Garenne has a straightforward, wet stone/granitic bouquet that is reserved, but nicely defined. The palate is crisp on the entry with a pleasant saline touch revealed during the second half, alongside orange peel and a dash of spice. Nicely composed, this la Garenne should drink well over the next 8-10 years, but opt for the Champ Canet or Combettes if you seek something with a little more sophistication.",,RP (93-95)
1658,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières, which comes exclusively from the lieu-dit “En la Richarde” this year, has a very austere, flinty nose that almost brings to mind a dry German Riesling! The palate is lighter than I was expecting, and perhaps not as complex as say, the les Referts or Perrières. My advice would be to approach this a little earlier than Sauzet’s other 2013s. ",,RP (93-95)
1659,Etienne Sauzet,Chassagne-Montrachet Les Encégnières,"The 2013 Chassagne-Montrachet Enceignieres has a fragrant bouquet with hints of white flowers and brioche infusing the citrus fruit. The palate has a taut, citric entry, perhaps just a little pinched at the moment with a sharp, quite malic finish. It just does not quite jump out of the blocks like the other 2013s at the moment.",,RP (93-95)
1660,Etienne Sauzet,Bourgogne Blanc,"Bottled at the end of August, the 2013 Bourgogne Blanc comes from three parcels supplemented with purchased fruit from another grower. It has a simple, slightly waxy bouquet. The palate is a little shrill on the entry: quiet piercing acidity here with an abrupt finish. Drink this over the next year or so. ",,RP (93-95)
1661,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2009 Puligny-Montrachet Les Combettes is beginning to really blossom in bottle. It has a reserved, stony, sea cave-scented bouquet that draws you in, though you have the feeling it is holding something back from those willing to cellar this Puligny. The palate is very well balanced with a gentle, spicy entry with notes of bruised apple, pear and a dash of pepper. It finishes it quite Zen-like fashion, but what is lacks in fruite it compensates with tension, so much so that it feels more like a 2010 than a 2009. Minimalist!",,RP (93-95)
1662,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru La Garenne,"The 2007 Puligny-Montrachet La Garenne has a slight mustiness on the nose that seems to obstruct the fruit intensity. The palate is sharp on the entry with sour lemon and pointed acidity, whilst the finish is missing depth and length. This is an under-par La Garenne from Sauzet.",,RP (93-95)
1663,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Combettes 2011 from Sauzet has a very composed bouquet with the minerality shining through, exuding great tension and allowing the aromatics that speak of a place. The palate is well balanced with a crisp line of acidity. This is well structured with judiciously integrated oak, touches of spicy citrus fruit and great tension toward the finish that fans out beautifully. Excellent. ",,RP (93-95)
1664,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet 2011 from Etienne Sauzet has a crisp and defined bouquet with chalk dust, fresh green apple and flint scents that express more vigor than Jacques Carillon’s example. The palate is medium-bodied with penetrating citrus fruit, a stony core and a focused, convincing finish that lingers in the mouth. This is a very well-crafted Puligny premier cru from Sauzet. ",,RP 93
1665,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. There is a touch of reduction on the nose of Sauzet’s Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières 2011, but there is plenty of fruit concentration with scents of citrus lemon, apple blossom and granite. The palate is chewy on the entry, quite phenolic, with good acidity, but like Thierry Glantenay’s 2011, it is missing delineation and finesse on the finish. ",,RP 93
1666,Etienne Sauzet,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru comes from grapes stationed at the top of the slope. It has an open, airy bouquet that reveals hints of mint and licorice as it opens up, becoming more exotic with each swirl. The palate is well-balanced, vibrant and complex, certainly evoking a more ostentatious take on the climat with an animated, spicy, mint-tinged finish that fans across the mouth and lingers long after the wine has departed. This tenacious Chevalier-Montrachet brims over with personality and substance, daring to outclass old “Monty”. And you know what? I think it does. 

Etienne Sauzet has been a source of fine Puligny wines since I first dipped my toe into Burgundy. I visited their winery located on the fringe of Puligny that was constructed just over ten years ago: a tastefully furnished facility equipped with a comfortable tasting room, ideal for laptops tired of being precariously balanced between barrels. Sauzet’s policy has been to buy in fruit to augment their own 9.5-hectare of holdings, almost exclusively from within Puligny-Montrachet. The original parcels had been accumulated by Etienne Sauzet in the 1920s and expanded in piecemeal fashion until 1989, whereupon his daughter divided their vineyards for tax purposes. After almost inevitable familial dissention the holdings were splintered to form domains Jean-Marc Boillot (based in Pommard and taking a significant proportion of the vines) and Henri Boillot (Volnay). Together they essentially deprived daughter Jeanine and her husband Gerard Boudot of the lion’s share of their premier crus. Ergo from 1991 Gerard and Jeanine supplemented the family’s remaining vines with out-sourced fruit and set about rebuilding their own portfolio in Batard-Montrachet and Bienvenue-Batard-Montrachet. Jeanine’s son-in-law Benoit Riffault, who escorted me through their 2012s, commented that these days the domaine is out-sourcing less than previously. Now approximately 15% of fruit is bought in through contracts and I can imagine that figure might ultimately be zero.  Their portfolio did not go unscathed by the difficult growing season. There were one or two esteemed premier crus such as Les Folatieres and Les Champs Canet whereby the triple whammy of hail damage confiscated the wines of their usual breeding. Some of these parcels were up to 80% down and the total crop was depleted by half. Fortunately, they are in the minority. Otherwise, I found that their best wines were brimming over with vigor and tension, encapsulating the mineralite of their terroirs. Sauzet’s wines can sometimes be obscured by sulfur in their youth. However, I did not find such problems here. And I feel that as the domaine as relied less and less on out-sourced fruit, so their wines have become more and more consistent. In 2012 they are crowned by a scintillating Chevalier-Montrachet that ranks as one of the finest that I tasted. If that is beyond your means, then apart from some outstanding premier crus, their Puligny village cru is as dependable as ever. Spotting a couple of palates of village cru destined for “The Wine Society” in the UK, I imagined a lot of satisfied members savoring this superb wine over the next three or four years. N.B.

1667,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrieres comes from 40-year-old vines, the last plot before you reach Les Referts. It has a strict, mineral-driven bouquet that is quintessential Perrieres, evoking sea spray and shucked oyster shell aromas. The palate is extremely well-balanced with crisp acidity. Notes of dried lemon peel, spice and flint gain vigor towards the finish that feels long and persistent in the mouth, although you feel that it is keeping secrets back for after bottling. One of my picks from the domaine this year.

1668,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru originates from vines that are essentially an extension of the rows in Bienvenue, sandwiched between those belonging to Anne-Claude Leflaive and Bachelet-Ramonet. As usual, this Batard-Montrachet is timorous on the nose, demanding coaxing to reveal its flint and granite aromas complemented by a hint of apple blossom. The palate is very well-balanced with a light honeyed note on the entry. There is good depth here and it has a winsome finish that glides across the mouth with style. This is a pretty Bienvenue imbued with style and personality.

1669,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Bienvenue-Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru is located on the Pucelles side of the vineyard and comes from 70-year-old vines, the oldest in Sauzet’s possession. The nose is very fragrant with scents of granite and dandelion emerging with aeration, all with very fine delineation. The palate is well-balanced with suggestions of white peach and dried apricot on the entry. It remains taut and linear. No flourish on the finish here – just direct mineral notes that leave you wanting another sip. This is infused with great tension and it should age well.

1670,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Referts comes from their 0.7-hectare parcel of around 60-year-old vines located in the middle of the vineyard. It has a generous bouquet with melon, dried stone and flint notes that does not quite have the exuberance of the Champs-Gain. The palate is very well-balanced with cheeky peach notes furnishing the entry. This is a pretty Puligny, generous in the mouth with a slight viscosity coming through towards the finish. This is probably suitable for earlier drinking than Sauzet’s other premier crus.

Jeanine’s son-in-law Benoit Riffault, who escorted me through their 2012s, commented that these days the domaine is out-sourcing less than previously.

Some of these parcels were up to 80% down and the total crop was depleted by half. Fortunately, they are in the minority. Otherwise, I found that their best wines were brimming over with vigor and tension, encapsulating the mineralite of their terroirs. Sauzet’s wines can sometimes be obscured by sulfur in their youth. However, I did not find such problems here. And I feel that as the domaine as relied less and less on out-sourced fruit, so their wines have become more and more consistent. In 2012 they are crowned by a scintillating Chevalier-Montrachet that ranks as one of the finest that I tasted. If that is beyond your means, then apart from some outstanding premier crus, their Puligny village cru is as dependable as ever.

1671,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Le Montrachet Grand Cru comes from grapes sourced from two parcels on the Puligny-Montrachet from Baron Thenard. The nose is actually quite similar to the Chevalier-Montrachet. It takes time to unfurl, offering flint, wet pavement and green apple with time. Strict and correct. The palate is well-balanced with a harmonious opening, the acidity very well-judged. It is very linear, very mineral, although following on from the Chevalier; you end up yearning for its feistiness. Still, this is a fine Montrachet that does not quite leave you quivering with anticipation like the Chevalier-Montrachet, nor indeed the Les Perrieres.

Etienne Sauzet has been a source of fine Puligny wines since I first dipped my toe into Burgundy. I visited their winery located on the fringe of Puligny that was constructed just over ten years ago: a tastefully furnished facility equipped with a comfortable tasting room, ideal for laptops tired of being precariously balanced between barrels. Sauzet’s policy has been to buy in fruit to augment their own 9.5-hectare of holdings, almost exclusively from within Puligny-Montrachet. The original parcels had been accumulated by Etienne Sauzet in the 1920s and expanded in piecemeal fashion until 1989, whereupon his daughter divided their vineyards for tax purposes.

1672,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes comes from a single hectare on the Meursault side close to Dominique Lafon’s Charmes. This has a very attractive bouquet with light scents of flint, gypsum and bruised apple that expands nicely in the glass with aeration. The palate is nicely focused with touches of bitter lemon and dried orange peel that segues into a stony, flinty finish that is perhaps atypical for this, habitually one of their fattest premier crus. The bottom line is that this is a commendable wine for the vintage, though this year, not my pick of the bunch.

1673,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatieres is a very small cuvee this year – just two barriques from the lieu-dit “En Le Richard”. There is a sense of orthodoxy and conservatism on the nose coming after the vibrant and much more expressive Les Perrieres. The palate is well-balanced with mineral tones, a touch of ginger developing in the mouth, but it feels a little clipped and truncated towards the finish.

The nose is focused and linear, not dissimilar to the Les Perrieres though without the same level of intensity. The palate is well-balanced with a gunflint opening but it does not quite follow-up the promising start, dipping before the finish line on the attenuated finish. Perhaps it will put on more weight before bottling?

It has a pretty bouquet with hints of white peach and passion fruit at first, though with aeration this ebbs away to reveal stony, Alpine stream scents. The palate is crisp on the entry with pithy fruit combining well with the citrus and bitter lemon. There is a fine edginess here with a touch of lemongrass lining the spicy finish. While this represents a creditable Puligny premier cru, I suggest that the village cru might represent better value and other premier crus offer more breeding this year.

1677,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2010 Montrachet is sweet, inviting and delicate. Even though Sauzet’s Montrachet is from the Chassagne side, it has an element of finesse that is reminiscent of Puligny. Lemon, white flowers and crushed rocks are woven together in a fabric of unusual class and elegance. Here, too, there is an element of reduction, but this is the wine where that note is least bothersome. Saline notes linger on the precise, nuanced finish. Anticipated maturity: 2014+. 

I have to admit I was a bit perplexed by these 2010s from Sauzet. A number of wines were massively reduced and/or heavily sulfured to a degree I did not encounter at any other property I visited. The best selections in the lineup are quite strong, which suggests some of those elements may dissipate over time as the wines integrate, but at the same time, I can only report what is in the glass, and the reality is that some of the wines in this lineup are very awkward at this stage. I suggest readers taste the Sauzet 2010s before making any major commitments. The 2010 harvest started on September 17th. Yields were closer to normal in the village wines, but down by as much as 35% in the premier and grand crus. The wines spent 12 months in oak, 25-35% new for the premier crus, and 35% new for the grand crus, followed by six months in tank.

1684,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Sauzet’s 2010 Puligny-Montrachet Les Combettes is harmonious and beautifully balanced. Nothing in particular stands out.

Anticipated maturity: 2014+.  

I have to admit I was a bit perplexed by these 2010s from Sauzet. A number of wines were massively reduced and/or heavily sulfured to a degree I did not encounter at any other property I visited. The best selections in the lineup are quite strong, which suggests some of those elements may dissipate over time as the wines integrate, but at the same time, I can only report what is in the glass, and the reality is that some of the wines in this lineup are very awkward at this stage.

1705,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Boudot’s 2007 Montrachet represents juice of 50 year old vines that he buys and raises, and I wonder whether to consider the sensational results more a tribute to the inherent quality of this site or to the degree of control he is able to exercise. Musk, daffodil, honeysuckle, lily, nut oils, and brown spices make for a head-turning aromatic display and ally themselves to succulent peach and Persian melon on a silken, palpably thick and dense, yet elegantly-expressive, energy-charged palate. For sheer length, too, this perfectly-proportional wine edges out even the Chevalier-Montrachet. I’m so used to it being the other way around in instances where these two sites can be directly compared that this demonstration of quality amazes me, even allowing for a centuries-long tradition of hype. This ought to be worth following for more than a decade. 

Gerard Boudot harvested the majority of his fruit during the first week in September, after what he considered to have been one last, critical week of ripening, and believing that it was more important to retain ripe acidity than go for a bit more potential alcohol. He reports having chaptalized selectively – largely at village level and to a very small degree – but the wines top out below 13% finished alcohol. Boudot did a rigorous selection not, he claimed, to remove rot but to cull any under-ripe berries and bunches. All of his 2007s were bottled by March, 2009 after their having spent 5-6 months assembled in tank, a period of passive watchfulness that is among diverse aspects of Boudot’s regimen to have been adjusted in recent years in response to high incidence of wines from the late ‘90s that displayed excessive oxidization after a half dozen years. The regimen of new oak here, incidentally, is 20-25% for the premier crus (with the exception of a bit more on Combettes), and never stands out as a factor detectable in itself. (The wines of this domaine legally belong to two entities, that of Domaine Etienne Sauzet and the company consisting of Boudot and his wife. In addition fruit is acquired for a few bottlings on long-term contract. I have not attempted to call attention to these differences in my notes, and in fact numerous crus represented here have multiple official owners.)

1706,Etienne Sauzet,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Boudot’s 2007 Bienvenues-Batard Montrachet – from septuagenarian vines – reminds me of the ability of this small cru to offer a grander and yet more rarified version on the character of its northern neighbor Les Pucelles. Heady of honeysuckle, iris, anise, heliotrope, rowan, and white peach lead into a silken, lushly-fruited, liquidly floral palate that caresses yet enlivens. Suggestions of ginseng and almond paste add to the complexity of a lingering lift-off of a finish. I was completely carried away by this wine, but only when I returned to it after tasting the great Sauzet Montrachet of this vintage did I become fully aware of the amazing clarity, subtlety, refinement, and buoyancy it delivers. I would like to think this will be worth following for a decade or more, but for heaven’s sake – if you are lucky enough to acquire some bottles – do not neglect to relish it in its youth as well!

Silken-textured and refined in texture yet positively gripping in its sense of implacable, enervative, vibratory persistence of chalk, citrus oils, white pepper, and herbal-floral concentrates, this superb representation of some of wine’s finest acreage should be worth following for a decade or more, but is another Sauzet 2007 not to be missed young. In Boudot’s view, it’s typical for Chevalier to deliver “the most immediate pleasure” of the Montrachet grand crus. Here you get surfeit of energy and near-indelible pungency as well as of uncannily seductive liquid flowers, yet with lift and supreme elegance.

A pungent nose of lavender, lilac, fresh ginger, lime zest, and crushed stone leads to an active, vibratory, persistently pungent yet silken-textured palate impression that is palpably dense without exhibiting any heaviness. Persian melon and peach lend lusciousness, while saline, iodine, and crustacean elements make for intriguing mineral complexity. The combination of volume, tactile grip, prominent stoniness, and sheer sizzle in the finish here remind me a bit of certain great Gruner Veltliners. If you depart from a glass of this without feeling enervated and invigorated, better check with your doctor! 

Gerard Boudot harvested the majority of his fruit during the first week in September, after what he considered to have been one last, critical week of ripening, and believing that it was more important to retain ripe acidity than go for a bit more potential alcohol. He reports having chaptalized selectively – largely at village level and to a very small degree – but the wines top out below 13% finished alcohol. Boudot did a rigorous selection not, he claimed, to remove rot but to cull any under-ripe berries and bunches. All of his 2007s were bottled by March, 2009 after their having spent 5-6 months assembled in tank, a period of passive watchfulness that is among diverse aspects of Boudot’s regimen to have been adjusted in recent years in response to high incidence of wines from the late ‘90s that displayed excessive oxidization after a half dozen years. The regimen of new oak here, incidentally, is 20-25% for the premier crus (with the exception of a bit more on Combettes), and never stands out as a factor detectable in itself. (The wines of this domaine legally belong to two entities, that of Domaine Etienne Sauzet and the company consisting of Boudot and his wife. In addition fruit is acquired for a few bottlings on long-term contract. I have not attempted to call attention to these differences in my notes, and in fact numerous crus represented here have multiple official owners.)

1709,Etienne Sauzet,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Grown in the fat neck of this grand cru that runs alongside Bienvenues and up to Pucelles, the Sauzet 2007 Batard-Montrachet smells with aggressive pungency of citrus oils, peach kernel, and quarry dust, then displays more overtly stony, alkaline mineral character, prominent acidity, and restrained sense of ripeness than one normally expects from this cru. Big-boned and palpably dense, it doesn’t lack for a sense of energy nor does it become heavy, but on the other hand, those seeking charm or seduction from this palate-coating, ineradicably intense wine will at least for now be disappointed.

1710,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Sauzet’s 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Folatieres is doubtless marked by one of its two contributory parcels being the rocky “En Richard,” well to the south of the rest of Folatieres; high above the tiny Puligny Les Demoiselles and the northern tip of Chevalier-Montrachet, a location conducive to brightness and mineral characteristics. Hyacinth, apple blossom, and fresh lemon in the nose lead to a juicy, lively, yet silken-textured palate and a long, bittersweet finish featuring chalk, stone, apple pip, and played off against a shimmering reprise of citrus and of floral perfume in liquid form. This impeccably-balanced, nuanced Puligny should continue to reverberate on your palate for another 8-10 years.

1711,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Gain,"Another of the Sauzet trio (or, depending on whether one includes 2 barrels of La Truffiere – which I did not have chance to taste this vintage – quartet) of bottlings from the upper elevations of Puligny, their 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Champs-Gain exudes head-turning vividness of buddleia perfume; bright fresh lime, yellow plum and liquid floral perfume on a lithe but silken palate; and finishes with refreshment, lift, and invigoration, with tactile impingement of lime zest and chalk. This ravishing tonic of a Puligny is distinguished for now by its combination of elegance and intensity, but will probably gain in complexity over the next several years, and I would certainly feel free to follow it for at least half a dozen.

1712,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champ Canet,"The Sauzet 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Champ Canet – from 57 year old vines – is pungent and mineral in character from its nose of crushed stone, white pepper, salt spray, and lemon zest to its persistently juicy, gripping, vibratory finish. Along the way, brown spices and peach kernel add piquancy. There is urgency and an athletic leanness to this super-concentrate that will probably relax with another year or two: Boudot opines that with rare exceptions such as 2006 this bottling is never youthfully forward. Here is another candidate for 8-10 years in bottle. I paused before deciding not to add “promising,” since age-ability assessments at this address – as at so many others – cannot fail to be colored by disappointingly precipitant maturation in bottle during the past decade.

1713,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières,"Boudot’s 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Perrieres is scented with honeysuckle and iris, leading into a palate with prominent peach kernel bitterness playing against persistent floral perfume; and finishing with fresh white peach, lemon, white pepper, and chalk. This lacks quite the density, textural allure, or focus of the Champs-Gain Sauzet, but displays considerable similarity (despite their disparate locations). Lift and brightness are the fortes in this wine that I suspect will be best enjoyed over the next 4-5 years.

Any tendency this bright, tensile wine would have towards austerity is ameliorated by its glycerin-rich texture, which also helps with a hint of finishing roughness.

1715,Etienne Sauzet,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Representing an assemblage of fruit from seven diverse parcels and nearly as many separately-vinified lots, the Sauzet 2007 Puligny Montrachet offers a bitter-sweet aromatic melange of iris, ripe peach, and piquant peach kernel. Exhibiting the tension and interchange Boudot considers characteristic for this vintage (especially in Puligny) between fruit and chalky, saline, and otherwise mineral aspects, this undeniably takes some of its interplay from the juxtaposition of richer material from the environs of Enseignieres and Batard with fruit from stonier, sparer ground near the Meursault border. Suggestions of grapefruit zest and peach skin add a sense of invigoration, although fruit pit and alkaline elements lend a slightly bitter and austere final note. This is significantly more polished than the corresponding Chassagne Sauzet, and I would expect it to perform well for at least the next 3-4 years.

It is packed with loads of buttered hazelnuts, sea shells, gravel, and white peaches. Even though it is decadently fat and rich, this Montrachet has superb delineation and focus.

Interestingly, Boudot was compelled to include quotation marks around the word Chardonnay on this wine's label.

1811,Etienne Sauzet,Montrachet Grand Cru,"On January 17, 1997, a Belgian wine merchant held a comprehensive tasting of virtually every  Montrachet at the Crillon Hotel in Paris. In addition to myself, Pierre Rovani was the only other American in attendance. The group was evenly split between members of the Belgian/French wine trade and private consumers. I was permitted to insert several top California Chardonnays in the tasting as ""ringers."" I provided the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge and the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. The tasting was impeccably organized, with the wines served blind in multiple flights. The results, although not unbelievable to me, were shocking to the group of serious Belgian and French wine tasters. Two of the French tasters were well-known winemakers. One of them who asked to remain anonymous proclaimed that in large part, the group of Montrachets was ""a crime against France's patrimony."" The group overwhelmingly rated the  Peter Michael Chardonnay Pointe Rouge the top wine. Several tasters recognized that it was a California wine, but they still felt it was by far the most compelling, complex, and complete wine of the tasting. Second place went to another ""ringer,"" the  Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Le Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, third place was awarded to the  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne another ringer, and fourth place went to yet another ""ringer,"" the 1992 Mount Eden Estate Chardonnay. Of the Montrachets, three producers produced wines that certainly merited outstanding ratings. The fifth place wine was the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti  Montrachet; sixth place went to Domaine Lafon's  Montrachet; and seventh place was the  Domaine Ramonet Montrachet.

My numerical ratings generally mirrored the group's, with the Peter Michael Pointe Rouge receiving 97 points, Domaine Valette Pouilly-Fuisse Clos de Monsieur Noly Vieilles Vignes, 95;  Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne, 96+; Mount Eden 1992 Chardonnay Estate, 94; DRC  Montrachet, 93; Domaine Lafon  Montrachet, 91+; Domaine Ramonet  Montrachet, 90+; and most of the other Montrachets in the mid to upper-eighties, except for the appalling  Montrachets from Delagrange-Bachelet and Rene Fleurot. A tropical fruit-scented, disjointed the acidity stuck out as it does in many New World Chardonnays  Robert Drouhin Montrachet Marquis de la Guiche was another underachiever. Only four of the Montrachets possessed the depth and richness or the group's top three wines. Perhaps the most remarkable conclusion of this tasting was that none of the Montrachets displayed the complexity of the group's favorite three wines. And let's not hear any whining about these Montrachets needing 5-10, perhaps 15 years of cellaring. That may be the case in vintages such as 1986 or 1995, but the  Montrachets are extremely forward, low acid wines except those that appeared to have had far too much acidity added. Too many of them were diluted, disjointed, flabby, and flat compared to the non-Montrachet wines of this tasting.

Much is being made in European wine writing circles about American versus European tastes, another phony non-issue by writers who would better serve their readership by doing more tasting than pontificating. While no single tasting can be considered definitive, this particular tasting did prove that a group of French and Belgian tasters exhibited a preference for California Chardonnays. C'est la vie.

1845,Domaine Georges Roumier,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot,"The 2001 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot from Domaine Humbert Frères offers up a bouquet dominated by tertiary notes: chocolate, coffee, game bird and a framing of wood. On the palate, the wine is nicely structured, with cool acids, good focus and a fine-grained chassis of tannin, its finish dry rather than generous.

This might have some merit as a generic wine, but one does not feel its propinquity to Le Chambertin.",,RP (92-93)
1847,Domaine Georges Roumier,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot,"The 2000 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot from Humbert Frères offers up a mature nose of dried cherry, cola and raw cocoa. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple, pure and sappy, displaying nice textural elegance and moderate concentration. It lacks the depth and persistence to score higher, but it's a creditable achievement in a challenging vintage.",,RP (92-93)
1848,Domaine Georges Roumier,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles-Saint-Jacques,"The 2000 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles-Saint-Jacques from Humbert Frères reveals a vegetal bouquet of red berries and undergrowth that suggests the fruit struggled to attain full ripeness. On the palate, the tannins are fine and supple, but the raw materials impose a limitation on the level of quality the wine can attain.",,RP (92-93)
1849,Domaine Georges Roumier,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Poissenot has a very elegant bouquet with perfumed strawberry and raspberry scents, with the oak here very discreet. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, dark berry fruit intermingling with cold and white pepper, leading to a structured finish that does not outstay its welcome.

1850,Domaine Georges Roumier,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Estournelles has a broody, quite tertiary bouquet that will need a couple of years to fully subsume the oak.

1851,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru is superb, unfurling in the glass with a stunning bouquet that mingles aromas of smoky wild berries and cherries with savory bass notes of dark chocolate, grilled game and rich soil.

1852,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru is excellent this year, bursting with expressive aromas of orange rind, rose petal, raspberries and cherries.

1853,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"The 2017 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière is a real success, and decidedly reminiscent of the domaine's excellent 2007. Offering up aromas of sweet red berries, warm spices, peony and subtle soil tones, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a fine core of fruit that cloaks its rich but fine-grained tannic chassis. While it's an elegant rendition of the Clos de la Bussière, this always needs bottle age.",,RP (93-95)
1854,Domaine Georges Roumier,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"There will be almost 700 bottles of the 2017 Echézeaux Grand Cru, a considerable improvement on the debut vintage in quantity—only a half barrel was produced—and in quality, as the 2016 was rather dominated by its new feuillette. Offering up aromas of wild berries, peony and orange rind, the wine is medium to full-bodied, tender and delicate, with an open-knit core of pretty fruit, juicy acids and melting tannins.",,RP (93-95)
1855,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes,"A lovely bouquet of cherries, rose petals, forest floor and subtle espresso roast introduce the 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes, a medium to full-bodied wine with an ample, more open-knit and more ethereal profile than the earthier, denser Clos de la Bussière that preceded. Sneaky persistence on the finish makes me suspect that this will continue to gain in depth as it completes its élevage.",,RP (93-95)
1856,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"Lovely aromas of cherries, orange rind and candied peel mingle with savory bass notes in an expressive bouquet to introduce Roumier's 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Village, a medium to full-bodied, ample wine that has gained in fleshy and texture since I tasted it in the spring but has retained its succulent, melting profile. It's an immensely charming Chambolle.",,RP (93-95)
1857,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"One of the wines of the vintage, the 2007 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru has shut down considerably in the last few years, and it's clear that this is one of the few 2007 red Burgundies truly built from the long haul. The wine unfurls in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of red and black cherries, peony, orange zest and woodsmoke that's far less extroverted and explosive than it was only four years ago. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a tight-knit core, fine-grained structuring tannins and a long, stony finish. At this stage, the 2006 rendition is much more approachable, and I'd advise readers who own the 2007 to forget it for the better part of a decade.",,RP (93-95)
1858,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"The 2007 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses continues to drink beautifully, soaring from the glass with a magical bouquet of red and black cherries, wild roses, peony, coniferous forest floor and blood orange, framed by emergent savory nuances of espresso roast and subtle new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, its melting tannins concealed behind a deep core of crystalline fruit, underpinned by succulent acids that lend lift to the long, fragrant finish. This Amoureuses is a touch more reserved than it was a few years ago, so I would recommend forgetting it in the cellar until 2020 or beyond.",,RP (93-95)
1859,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"The 2007 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras is exceptional, offering up a beautifully pure bouquet of red cherries, raspberries and peony, with scant sign of the tertiary nuances to come. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and glossy, with a succulent core of fruit that largely conceals its tannic frame, concluding with a long, chalky finish that's firmly stamped by the terroir of Les Cras.",,RP (93-95)
1860,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"This vintage is a stunner chez Roumier, and the 2007 Chambolle-Musigny Village is no exception, bursting from the glass with an expressive bouquet of raspberries, sweet forest floor, rose petal and cocoa nib. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, sappy and expansive, with melted tannins and a giving core of fruit.",,RP (93-95)
1861,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Like his Chambolle Villages, the 1999 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru from Christophe Roumier is beginning to drink beautifully, bursting from the glass with aromas of red plum, cherry, grilled meat, truffle, toasty oak and a top note of heather. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, rich and ample, with a generous core of cool fruit, excellent length and a long, chalky finish that is classic Ruchottes-Chambertin.",,RP (93-95)
1862,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"Roumier's 1999 Chambolle-Musigny Village is beginning to drink well, offering up an expressive bouquet of raspberry, cherry, rose petal, rich soil and potpourri. On the palate, the wine is velvety, medium full and youthful, with melting tannins and bright acids and a deep core of fruit. This is an excellent Chambolle Village that is showing very nicely after a prolonged slumber in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1863,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, Roumier's 2015 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru is quite reticent, unfurling in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of cherries, cassis, dark chocolate, peonies and espresso roast. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and powerful, with a strikingly concentrated and multidimensional core, an ample endowment of rich, satiny tannin and a long, chewy finish. This is a ripe but structural wine that will demand—and reward—considerable patience: it's likely to prove one of the most long-lived red Burgundies of the vintage.",,RP (93-95)
1864,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind, Christophe Roumier's 2015 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru was especially impressive, unwinding in the glass with aromas of sweet wild berries, dried roses, raw cocoa and espresso roast. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with wonderful depth, dimension and concentration, underpinned by a lovely line of acidity. The combination of amplitude, power and vibrancy make this very special indeed. I won't touch any of my bottles for a decade and would counsel readers to do the same.",,RP (93-95)
1865,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"Tasted blind, the 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses is quite closed, unfurling with extended aeration to reveal a pretty bouquet of wild berries, dark cherries and potpourri, complemented by some deep bass notes of espresso roast and toasty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, succulent and richly structured, with a deep and unusually tight-knit core, fine but abundant tannins and a long finish. While wines from this site are often charming out of the blocks, this is an Amoureuses that will demand and reward cellaring.",,RP (93-95)
1866,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"Tasted blind, Roumier's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras showed well, exhibiting aromas of raspberries, cherries, peonies and espresso roast, framed by some toasty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and even lavish, with an expansive attack, a generous core of dark, savory fruit and a framing of satiny structuring tannins. This is quite a ripe, expressive rendition of Les Cras, in keeping with recent vintages of this Roumier bottling, such as 2012.",,RP (93-95)
1867,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Roumier's 2001 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru was showing very well indeed and was more open for inspection than a bottle I enjoyed 11 months ago, offering up a complex bouquet of real depth, featuring ripe red cherry, peony, undergrowth and venison, framed by a discrete touch of nutty new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a chewy chassis of youthful tannins, an ample core of fruit and a firm, sapid finish. While this misses the intensity and ineffable completeness of the greatest Roumier vintages, this Bonnes Mares is an undeniable success, and it will continue to develop for two decades.",,RP (93-95)
1868,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru consists of a single 180-liter new barrel with 100% whole bunch fruit, so keep that in mind when requesting your allocation of a dozen magnums, preferably signed by Christophe himself. He lost around half his vines due to frost, though he confessed that this was not as much as he expected since they are located toward the upper reaches of the vineyard. It has a brilliantly defined, crystalline bouquet laden with blackberry, briary, minerals and wilted rose petal. Haunting. It is as if to say, what frost? The palate is medium-bodied with filigreed tannin, and yet there is impressive density. This is so pure and expressive, with hints of kirsch and orange peel toward the vivid finish that has almost clinical precision. The wake of the aftertaste is that of an ocean liner charging across the Atlantic. The quality of this Musigny is inversely proportional to its quantity.",,RP (93-95)
1869,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"There is only around half the production of the 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses this year, which equates to three barrels or a measly 750 bottles. It has a heavenly bouquet with lifted black cherries, cassis and blueberry that are just so vivacious, as if not caring two hoots about the frost damage. The palate is beautifully balanced with fine and slightly chalky tannin. There is a noticeable saline influence with hints of oyster shell toward the dense, gently grippy finish and finally hints of tea leaf on the aftertaste. The only thing wrong about this wine is the quantity. Bewitching...",,RP (93-95)
1870,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru, labelled under ""Christophe Roumier"" as usual, was unaffected by the frost, and Christophe described how this cuvée is more “relaxed” as a result. I concur. It has a gorgeous and very pure bouquet with ebullient red cherry, strawberry and cranberry fruit intermingling with blood orange and mineral scents. The palate is medium-bodied with dense, fairly strict tannins that lend weight to this Charmes-Chambertin. I commented to Christophe that it is very Mazoyères in style, forgetting that it is actually from Mazoyères. Superb.",,RP (93-95)
1871,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"The 2016 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru was not as affected by the frost as other cuvées. Christophe explained that the northern part of his vines was less frozen and ended up being cropped at a none-too-shabby 28 hectoliters per hectare. Also, his holding is augmented by half a hectare situated on the terres blanches soils under a new fermage from Pierre Naigeon. It has a very precise bouquet that delivers exquisite blackberry, briary and subtle leafy/undergrowth scents emanating from the whole bunch element. For a Bonnes Mares, this has an atypically firm structure: a more masculine Bonnes Mares with dark berry fruit and hints of graphite toward the finish. This is a Bonnes Mares that is holding its breath, and it deserves several years, probably a decade, to reach its drinking window. It is not quite as good as the 2015 Bonnes Mares, but it is only a whisker away.",,RP (93-95)
1872,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru is labelled under Christophe's own name as usual. He told me that it was impacted by around 20% by the frost, unlike Mugneret-Gibourg or Rousseau’s that were both spared. Christophe posited that this might be due to the weeds between the rows exacerbating frost damage. It has a tightly wound bouquet at first, very mineral-driven, with cold limestone permeating the pure dark berry fruit. There is just a very slight shrillness here. The palate is medium-bodied with a strong saline influence right from the beginning. It has a firm and almost foursquare structure, and yet there is outstanding focus. Quibbling, it is not quite as persistent as the 2015 Ruchottes-Chambertin last year, then again, you are not going to refuse any, if offered.",,RP (93-95)
1873,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"The 2016 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière almost seemed to relish being unaffected by the frost. A soupçon of schadenfreude perchance? It delivers a joyous, well-defined and concentrated bouquet with a mixture of black and blue fruit, almost Chambolle-like thanks to its richness. The palate is medium-bodied with fresh acidity, and there is superb density here. It feels lively and tensile without compromising the backbone one expects from this vineyard: layers of black fruit tinged with graphite toward the finish. It is almost as if this Morey is rubbing in the fact that its Chambolle stablemates suffered so much during the growing season. This ranks alongside the stupendous 2015 last year.",,RP (93-95)
1874,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Cras,"The 2016 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Cras was cropped at just 10.5 hectoliters per hectare due to the frost damage. Yet still, it has retained a very complex and mineral-driven bouquet with discrete scents of sea cave and oyster shell permeating the red and black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin that frames a surprisingly juicy Chambolle-Musigny considering the frost damage. Then toward the last third, it tapers a little and becomes more compact, linear and sappy that together suggest this will be a long-term prospect. Against the odds, it is one of the best premier cru Chambolle-Musignys from a tumultuous season.",,RP (93-95)
1875,Domaine Georges Roumier,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2016 Echézeaux Grand Cru is a new méteyage located in the lieu-dit of ""En Orveau"" that Christophe took over a week before harvest (therefore, he did not do any of the viticulture). There is just half a barrel due to the frost, which equates to a blink-and-you'll-miss-it 150 liters. I have to admit that unlike the Musigny, the new oak comes through more strongly on the nose and obstructs the fruit a little. But the palate is nicely balanced with good density, smoky and quite savory with a fresh, almost menthol finish. There should be two barrels and a quarter in 2017, so I think these will be a much better barometer of its potential.",,RP (93-95)
1876,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny Village was cropped at just 9.5 hectoliters per hectare due to frost, and it includes 20% to 30% whole bunch, as well as the declassified droplets of Chambolle Combottes. It initially has a bashful bouquet and gradually opens with pure red cherry and crushed strawberry scents, not delicate but perhaps understated and not wishing to make a fuss. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly coarse tannin on the entry, yet these appear more finessed on the second half whereupon it offers a touch of black pepper. Considering what the vines faced in the growing season, this should be considered a success.",,RP (93-95)
1877,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting, Christophe Roumier's 2014 Ruchottes Chambertin Grand Cru had a touch of volatile acidity on the nose, more feisty and fruit-driven than its peers, the barrel more pronounced and clearly requiring more time to be fully assimilated. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, more austere in style but nicely proportioned. There is impressive tension and salinity toward the marine-influenced finish and it feels very persistent. Give it 3 or 4 years in bottle. Tasted September 2017.",,RP (93-95)
1878,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Cras,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Cras from Christophe Roumier was showing just a touch of reduction on the entry, but that conceals plenty of concentrated red and black fruit with outstanding purity. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, grippy in the mouth with tarry black fruit, a fine line of acidity and a powerful, demonstrative finish that clings on after the wine has departed. It reminded me of Groffier in style, but maybe it is more nuanced on the finish. Whatever...just a fantastic ""bit of kit."" Tasted September 2017.",,RP (93-95)
1879,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey St Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Morey St Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière has a lifted, charming bouquet with ample black plum, damson and incense aromas that gain vigor in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine line of acidity, delivering the structure and perhaps the masculinity you expect from a Morey-Saint-Denis, with a pinch of black pepper than enhances the finish. This is a well-crafted if maybe slightly conservative wine from Christophe Roumier...but still ""yum yum."" Tasted September 2017.",,RP (93-95)
1880,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"It is 12 years since I last tasted the 1992 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru from Roumier. Perhaps I underrated it back then. Here, it showed much better with leafy red berry fruit, autumnal but much more vivacious than I was expecting. If anything, it coalesces in the glass and gains a sense of confidence. It may be born in a difficult growing season, but this Bonnes Mares wants to disabuse the drinker of his pessimism. And the palate is well balanced with good body, satisfying red fruit, dried herbs, a touch of Earl Grey and pleasant tartness on the finish. Of course, prices have skyrocketed over the intervening twelve years; however, the bottom line is that Christophe Roumier made a very fine Bonnes Mares this year. Tasted June 2017.",,RP (93-95)
1881,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The last time I tasted the 1995 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru from Roumier was back in 2010. Here, served from a magnum no less, I found that the bouquet remains quite sensual, but perhaps more backward and sultry than expected, possibly because of the larger format it was served from. The palate is medium-bodied, elegant and refined with orange rind and hints of brown sugar interlacing the red berry fruit. Again, like the bottle in 2010, I find this does not quite deliver the persistence you would expect from a wine of this stature, which is why I am parsimonious with my score. Very fine, no doubt, but not reaching for the stars. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1882,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 1985 Musigny Grand Cru from Domaine Georges Roumier is a fabled wine, one that is extraordinarily rare given that little more than a barrel is produced. As usual, I had to be a little skeptical about its provenance, but just feeling the bottle in my hand and tasting the wine itself left me in no doubt that it was genuine. Now just over three decades in age, it still has a fairly deep core with noticeable bricking on the rim. The aromatics felt a little aloof for the first 10-15 minutes, perhaps deeming whether I was worthy of the privilege? Then it magically blossomed in the glass with dark berries, damp undergrowth, fern and bay leaf. Each swirl of the glass seemed to reveal another facet. The palate was exquisitely balanced with filigree tannin, conveying the richness of the 1985 vintage yet with almost ineffable finesse and precision. Certainly a mercurial Musigny, the fruit darkened towards the finish with hints of Chinese tea and sandalwood emerging with time, yet never compromising the ""Pinot"" of this majestic wine. I am unlikely to ever taste this Musigny again; then again, once is an absolute honor. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1883,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"The 1985 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses from Roumier lived up to expectations. What a fabulous wine. Mature in color, the bouquet bursts from the glass with red cherries and wild strawberry, wild heather, a hint of bacon fat and a ferrous tincture. There is wonderful delineation here, the essence of pure Pinot Noir. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin. Perfect acidity and stunning balance, the flow and the energy of this Amoureuses is utterly bewitching. Effortless and captivating, this 1985 is now at the peak of its power, and while I cannot envisage it improving further, it should cruise at higher altitude for many years. Brilliant. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1884,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2015 Chambolle Musigny Village contains around 5% whole bunch fruit. It has an understated bouquet at first, needing just a few swirls of the glass to reveal red cherry and cranberry nose with purity rather than power. The palate is very well balanced with crunchy red fruit, wonderful acidity, fresh and with a touch on confit fruit on the engaging finish. What a delicious village cru this will grow up to be.",,RP (93-95)
1885,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2015 Musigny Grand Cru has a bouquet that will make you want to cry (with joy). It has astonishing purity, waves of pure red berry fruit tinged with minerals, hints of blood orange developing. There is astonishing focus here, even compared to all the vintages I have been lucky enough to taste from barrel since 2002. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin, a perfect symmetry, sorbet-like freshness with orange sorbet infusing the fruit that leans towards dark cherry and raspberry on the finish. It reminds me of the 2005 Musigny from barrel. It might be even better. This may represent the peak of the 2015 Burgundy vintage: just one barrel and a quarter for the world.",,RP (93-95)
1886,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes contains around 40% whole bunch this year. It has a very refined bouquet with dark, almost broody black fruit, a touch of cold granite and graphite, austere and yet blessed with exquisite delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with sorbet-like freshness on the entry, here more blue fruit than the Clos de la Bussière with an elegant, poised finish. The word that sprung to mind? Balletic.",,RP (93-95)
1887,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"The 2015 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière, which contains 50% whole bunch fruit, has a clean and precise, almost pixelated bouquet with blackberry, briary and cold limestone scents that gain intensity in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, quite structured in the mouth with filigree and tensile tannin. This is very focused, linear in style, which is surprising given the warmth during the growing season, with great clarity on the finish. This is just a fantastic Morey-Saint-Denis from Christophe Roumier.",,RP (93-95)
1888,Domaine Georges Roumier,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru comprises of two barrels this year, one of the new (there will be none in 2016 due to hail). It offers dried honey, honeysuckle and touches of brioche on the nose. The palate is rounded on the entry with tropical tones, guava and peach, a touch of pineapple towards the candied finish. It is a perfectly respectable Corton-Charlemagne that will give a decade's worth of drinking happiness.",,RP (93-95)
1889,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2015 Bourgogne Pinot Noir, which was totally de-stemmed and sees no new oak, has a fragrant bouquet of red cherry and pomegranate fruit, nicely defined and very natural in style. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, a touch of spice towards the satisfying finish. It serves as a (hopefully) affordable introduction to Christophe Roumier's wines.",,RP (93-95)
1890,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru from Christophe Roumier has a ripe redcurrant, kirsch and vanilla-tinged bouquet, high-toned but not volatile, generous if missing some mineralité. The palate is defined by its very smooth texture: seamless and so lithe in the mouth. There is impressive purity here and while you could describe this as ""showy"" (not an adjective that I often apply to Christophe's wines), that is meant in a positive way. There is the substance to suggest this will age with style -- a sophisticated and thoroughly enjoyable Bonnes-Mares to savor. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1891,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses had an odd bouquet, disjointed at first, a little reductive but coming together in the glass, though never fully conveying the joie-de-vivre of sumptuousness that you look for in this vineyard. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy, ripe dark berry and white pepper notes. It feels dense in the mouth and though it initially felt a little ""predictable,"" I noticed how it rapidly meliorated in the glass and its nuances and mineralité began to be conveyed. It needs plenty of time. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1892,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru from Christophe Roumier has a simpler bouquet than its peers: a little reduced to contend with, later sea spray and iodine scents infusing the tightly wound brambly red fruit underneath. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, moderate acidity, quite dense though it feels a little ""pushed"" at the moment, has not quite settled into its groove. I would hope to see more nuance develop in bottle as it was outclassed by Mugneret-Gibourg's own 2013 Ruchottes-Chambertin here. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1893,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière has a composed bouquet with cranberry and brambly black fruit, the oak neatly integrated here though tightly wound. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, cedar-tinged black fruit, a little spiciness here with some dryness just curtailing the creamy-textured finish. There is class here but I maintain that it was not Christophe's best in 2013. Tasted September 2016",,RP (93-95)
1894,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"This was the first time that I had tasted the 1995 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru from Christophe Roumier. It is said that he did nothing wrong in this vintage and this splendid bottle attests to that (though another bottle was slightly corked). It has a bouquet that clearly evinces Grand Cru quality: a complex, nuanced aromatic profile of red cherries, blueberry, cold stone and iris, all delivered with quite brilliant delineation. The palate does not disappoint. It has exquisite poise, supremely fine tannin and delivers that opulence and lusciousness you expect from Bonnes-Mares. The only fault is that you will finish your glass too quickly and the current market value. Those with bottles in their cellar ... I am jealous. Tasted September 2016.",,RP (93-95)
1895,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Amoureuses,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Amoureuses has an exquisitely defined bouquet, a touch of shucked oyster shell infusing the red cherry and blackberry fruit, as well as hints of cassis developing in the glass. The palate is crisp and taut, with fine acidity and crisp tannin; it is linear and so energetic on the finish, this has to be one of the best wines of the vintage. It is a wine that can barely contain its talent and it is sure to give so much pleasure over the next 20-30 years. This is simply awesome. ",,RP (93-95)
1896,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru has a fragrant, floral bouquet with touches of blueberry, violet, wet limestone and effervescent blood orange. There is simply wonderful delineation here. The palate is very well structured, linear and strict in accordance with the vintage, driving acidity here maintaining the freshness with superb minerality on the finish. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. ",,RP (93-95)
1897,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny,"The 2014 Musigny Grand Cru taken from the full barrel, not the feuillette, which is how much Christophe Roumier has this year. It has a crisp, mineral bouquet with black fruit, and there is a touch of graphite developing with time in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, with the oak showing a bit more here than the Amoureuses; it is quite powerful and dense on the finish, with a touch of white pepper and dried blood on the aftertaste. Of course, it is a very fine Musigny, although I suspect that the Bonnes-Mares and the Les Amoureuses 2014 may ultimately bestow more pleasure. But hey, are you really going to turn it down if someone offers you a glass? ",,RP (93-95)
1898,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Charmes Chambertin Grand Cru has a very precise and harmonious bouquet: blackberry and cranberry fruit, cold granite and sea spray. There is enthralling focus here, a quite profound Charmes-Chambertin. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet tannin, a bit of new wood to be subsumed, grippy in the mouth with a mineral-driven and tensile finish that is endowed with wonderful symmetry. Give this killer Charmes-Chambertin 4-6 years in bottle.",,RP (93-95)
1899,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes has a broody, gravel-tinged bouquet with undergrowth and briary scents, one that is decidedly more introspective than the Bussières. The palate is underpinned by very fine, slightly chalky tannin. The acidity drives this along, almost citric towards the pointed finish with a stony aftertaste. This is another thought-provoking and wondrously crafted Chambolle Musigny from Christophe Roumier. ",,RP (93-95)
1900,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny Villages has a refined bouquet with touches of hints of rose petal infusing the red berry fruit, fine minerality coming through. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and nicely structured. This displays good backbone for a village cru with fine precision on the slightly curtailed finish. Very fine.",,RP (93-95)
1901,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bourgogne,"The 2014 Bourgogne Rouge, which is completely destemmed, has a ripe and quite opulent bouquet with kirsch and orange sorbet aromas. The palate is supple in the mouth with sweet tannin, candied orange peel with a juicy red cherry finish. Just a delicious, straightforward generic red Burgundy to enjoy over the next five or so years.",,RP (86-88)
1902,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Amoureuses from Christophe Roumier was showing just a touch of TCA on the nose. Yet the quality of this Amoureuses was not obscured, particularly on the beautifully structured palate that feels so long and tender. Damn those corks that try to ruin what is a fantastic wine clearly visible underneath. ",,RP (86-88)
1903,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Bonnes Mares Grand Cru from Domaine Georges Roumier has a touch of reduction to get round first, though underneath are sophisticated red and black fruit, the oak nicely integrated though needing another couple of years to fully knit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, dense black fruit, quite saline in the mouth but nicely focused with a structured, introspective but extraordinarily long finish that will require three or four years to mellow. There is so much potential here - words written before I knew the identity of the grower. ",,RP (86-88)
1904,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chambolle Musigny 1er Cru les Cras from Christophe Roumier was showing a lot of reduction on the nose, yet underneath one can find lovely blackberry, game and dried blood aromas coming through mixed with autumn leaves and woodland scents. There is something very natural here. The palate is medium-bodied with fine definition, quite masculine and structured in style with good acidity, moving towards a harmonious, saline finish that beckons another sip. ",,RP (86-88)
1905,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Ruchottes Chambertin Grand Cru from Christophe Roumier does not have the pedigree of the best Mazis-Chambertin from Faiveley that was the standout tasting of the flight. Part of the reason is that there remains quite a bit of oak on the nose and there is also just a touch of reduction. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, masculine and very structured, sturdy and broad-shouldered. There is density to the Ruchottes-Chambertin and one suspects that its finesse will only be revealed with bottle age. ",,RP (86-88)
1906,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Morey St Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière from Christophe Roumier from has a brisk and lively bouquet with briary, blackberry and sous-bois notes, detailed and precise with subtle use of oak that feels discrete, yet gives the aromas lift. The palate is medium-bodied with lithe, slightly soft tannin. There is just the right amount of dryness here, but it needed just a little more backbone and drive towards the finish. Though not as stellar as it showed from barrel, I suspect this will find its mojo with a few more years in bottle. ",,RP (86-88)
1907,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2008 Bourgogne Rouge from Christophe Roumier is so good that for a moment, you wonder why you spend all those hard earned $ or £ for the premier or the grand crus. Without wishing to disrespect those wines, it is simple testament to how Christophe makes such a gorgeous generic red Burgundy. The nose is pure and beautifully defined: crisp, fresh and bursting with lively red cherry fruit laced with sous-bois scents. The palate demonstrates exquisite balance with more than adequate fruit concentration. It just so tensile from start to finish. Feel free to drink this now, but don't be afraid to leave it 10 years in bottle and surprise a few friends fretting about their bottles of Musigny. ",,RP (86-88)
1908,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"I am aware that we must not blaspheme against a great vintage like 2005 and a great winemaker like Christophe Roumier, but served blind, I must say that I was not the only one a little perplexed by the 2005 Chambolle Musigny Village. It has a monstrously backward nose of blackberry, lead and iodine scents, but the sensation is not far removed from hitting an aromatic brick wall. The palate is structured, backward and for want of a better expression, ""in your face,"" missing the elegance and finesse one associates with Christophe's wines. Perhaps we just met at an inopportune moment, but I was surprised when the identity of the bottle was revealed. Give it 5 years in bottle and let's see.",,RP (86-88)
1909,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"There is 1¼ barrels of the 2013 Musigny this year and Christophe mentioned that he would be transferring it into a used barrel the following week after my early November visit. It has a beguiling bouquet, like a more serious cousin of the Bonnes-Mares. There is very tangible sea foam/oyster shell tincturing the pure dark cherry and bilberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannins, perfect acidity and a silky texture. This Musigny is very harmonious and even though this was taken from the new barrels, it just oozes class. ",,RP (86-88)
1910,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru was showing some reduction on the nose. The palate is very silky to the touch, the acidity well judged and full of energy, touches of orange sorbet infusing the black fruit toward the focused finish that lingers long in the mouth. This is a sensual Charmes-Chambertin to enjoy over the next couple of decades",,RP (86-88)
1911,Domaine Georges Roumier,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"There are usually four barrels, but this year there are only 150 liters that Christophe will not commercialize.  I asked if I could taste it anyway, before bottling the following week. It had an attractive bouquet with lemon curd, white flowers and brioche, the palate not complex, but clean and balanced, segueing into a slightly waxy finish that shows respectable length. The only chance of ever tasting this is if Christophe invites you to dinner. I suggest you bring a Bâtard-Montrachet from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.",,RP (86-88)
1912,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Cras has a very reticent, broody bouquet that does not want to come out to play. The palate is vibrant and focused with wonderful chalky tannins, citric acidity and a long, lightly spiced finish that fans out with vim and vigor. This should be very satisfying once in bottle, although I wager that it will deserve more cellaring than Roumier’s other 2013s. ",,RP (86-88)
1913,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Combottes has a more earthy bouquet compared to Christophe’s other crus, though it comes armed with fine fruit intensity. The palate is well structured with good backbone: fine acidity here with a refined blackberry leaf finish that is a little reduced though of course that will blow off. This will have more to give once in bottle. ",,RP (86-88)
1914,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"The 2013 Morey-Saint-Denis Clos de la Bussiere has a taut, well-defined bouquet with light oyster-shell scents emerging in the glass. The palate is crisp and fresh with a chalky, almost brittle texture, noticeable acidity and a tart and pointed finish. This seems just a little disjointed at the moment, so hopefully it will meld together during the remainder of its maturation period. ",,RP (86-88)
1915,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"Due to be racked literally a few minutes before my arrival, the 2013 Chambolle-Musigny Village was more difficult to read, although it has plenty of dark cherry fruit “bubbling away” on the nose. The palate is finely balanced, clean and pure with filigree tannins – understated but with commendable poise if not enormous length.",,RP (86-88)
1916,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Deeper and more limpid in color that its peers, the Ruchottes-Chambertin 2011 from Christophe Roumier has a modern, more exotic bouquet with small dark cherries, crème de cassis and crushed violet petals. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tension and poise, good depth but very backward and sinewy. There is plenty of matière here, although we will have to wait for the finesse and elegance because it comes across as taciturn at present. This is worth cellaring for 6-8 years. ",,RP (86-88)
1917,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Christophe Roumier’s 2011 Bonnes-Mares comes across a little lean on the nose, although there is fine delineation – distinct marine scents emerging with time while there is just a touch of reduction. The palate is medium-bodied and quite masculine for a Bonnes-Mares. There is more reserve compared to its peers, but it is undeniably succinctly focused with an abiding sense of symmetry on the finish. Excellent, but at the moment it feels rugged for a Bonnes-Mares. I suspect that it will improve with 3-4 years in bottle.",,RP (86-88)
1918,Domaine Georges Roumier,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos de la Bussière,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Morey Saint Denis Clos de la Bussière from Christophe Roumier has a rather dense bouquet with blackcurrant pastilles, dried herbs, sous-bois and stemmy scents that become more intense with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a stern entry. There is a tinny tincture in the mouth, the finish missing the complexity of a premier cru, the aftertaste spicy with a dash of black pepper. I have to be honest, this did not put in a good performance and I was not the only taster to criticize this wine before its identity was revealed. ",,RP (86-88)
1919,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"Tasted blind in a line-up of 2011 Amoureuses in Holland, Georges Roumier’s 2011 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Amoureuses possesses a stricter nose vis-a-vis La Pousse d’Or’s Amoureuses ’11: slightly more herbaceous in style but well-defined and demonstrating good intensity. This is very natural and composed – very 2011 in style more than Amoureuses, but more bashful. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chalky tannins, a fine citric thread of acidity as well as tension, and a structured but feminine finish. This is a more elegant take on Amoureuses but one that is well made. This has a mouth-tingling saltiness on the finish. On this showing, this is the finest Amoureuses in 2011. Tasted June 2014.",,RP (86-88)
1920,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"I have not tasted the 2002 Bonnes-Mares for several years. This bottle has an exquisite, delineated bouquet that suggests those precocious dark berry fruits have mellowed and given way to scents of Indian ink and a splash of balsamic. The palate is marked by a fleshy sweet entry and forward, slightly aggressive tannins that coalesce with aeration in the glass. There is a touch of hardness toward the finish, indicating that it might benefit from another two or three years in bottle. This is a stubborn Bonnes-Mares that has yet to really settle into its groove, although that may come in time. Tasted November 2013.",,RP (86-88)
1921,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"The 2011 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras has blacker and earthier fruit compared to the village cru, but here there is more volume and intensity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly grainy tannins. There is lovely balance here: a little more forward than I was expecting, but generous with impressive complexity on the finish. This forms a fine introduction to the delights of Christophe’s wines. Drink 2016-2030.  

Only the super-rich now have the privilege of tasting the wines of Christophe Roumier , which is a shame, and something that Christophe himself must rue.

Roumier’s name was about to go from the esteemed to the iconic, with all the positives and negatives that it entails.

1923,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2000 Chambolle-Musigny Village is probably just reaching its peak. Deep in color for a village cru, it has a sweet, attractive bouquet with smudged strawberries, kirsch and dark plum. The entry is expressive and quite lush, that initial burst of summer fruit rapidly usurped by tertiary notes. There is just a touch of heat coming through on the finish, but it will continue to give pleasure of the next 3-4 years. Drink now-2016. Tasted December 2013.

1924,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 1991s were controversial for the domaine at the time, but my second encounter with the 1991 Musigny Grand Cru suggests that it has only now settled down. Fully mature on the nose (more so than the previous bottle in 2011), there are strong undergrowth scents, tea leaf, leather and a touch of burnt toast augmenting the red fruit. The palate is medium-bodied and rounded on the entry, nicely balanced with a silky, though conservative, finish that does not deliver the flourish, -the peacock’s tail- one might have hoped for on the finish. Still, this is a very fine Musigny. Drink now-2020.  Tasted November 2013.

1925,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"The 1969 Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru has a rustic bouquet straight from the farmyard, with touches of rusty piping, scorched earth and Morelles. It is funky, but endearing. The palate is medium-bodied, nicely balanced, and with good presence, as befitting such a great vintage. Harmonious and elegant towards the masculine finish, this might not eclipse Christopher Roumier’s recent wines, but is still a thoroughly enjoyable blast from the past. Tasted November 2013.

1926,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"Christophe told me that there are 1½ barrels of the 2012 Musigny Grand Cru this year. The nose is hauntingly beautiful – not powerful, not ostentatious, but just extraordinarily pure and delineated, the mineral component emerging with time in the glass. After a couple of minutes there are subtle floral scents – dried rose petal that a neatly placed. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins, astonishing purity and tension with a faultless finish that makes you wonder whether you should bother tasting Pinot Noir ever. This is heaven in a wine glass.

Christophe Roumier was multitasking when I arrived at his domaine in Chambolle-Musigny: his mobile constantly trilling and tasting parties arriving in haphazard fashion, running here and running there. And as we know, men are not cut out for multitasking. No wonder he complained about his headache, though hopefully the aspirin, washed down with a glug of Musigny, relieved his mal de tete. But generally Christophe Roumier was in top form – just like his wines. He commenced the harvest on 22 September after the usual travails of the growing season that reduced his crops. He rued the fact that he is undergoing an expansion of his cellars, but after 2012 and a meagre 2013, has little to put in them. He suggested a comparison between 2010 and 2012, though the latter is less tannic and more “weightless” – a great word to describe many of this vintage’s wines. This year there is all but one and a half barrels of his elusive Musigny. It is an utterly transcendental wine, perhaps equal to the 2005 when I encountered that out of barrel, but if that proves just a wee bit difficult to find, then the Clos de la Bussieres is a quite brilliant Morey Saint Denis that will offer immense pleasure over the next 20 years.

1927,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses has an atypically broody nose at first, so leaving the glass aside for a couple of minutes, one can see it transforms as those bewitching scents of red berry fruit, minerals, dried flowers and candied orange peel emerge with wondrous precision. The palate is medium-bodied with a firm structure and a more masculine personality than I have experienced vis-a-vis other vintages. There is very good weight and a lovely spiciness towards the long and totally entrancing finish. Perhaps the Bonnes-Mares has the edge at the moment, but this is still a sublime Amoureuses.

The palate is medium-bodied with entrancing energy and superb structure on the entry. Slightly more masculine than I was expecting, it has a stern but compelling finish that leaves you utterly satisfied. This has stupendous potential once in bottle.

1934,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"This is the third time I have tasted this vintage from Christophe Roumier and the best bottle that I have encountered. That brambly nose remains intact with less leafiness than I recall, although the aromatics do not possess the complexity of other ’93 Grand Crus tasted alongside. The palate is sinewy on the entry, more youthful than I was anticipating with harmonious, light tannins but good weight on the red-berried finish. For me, it is just missing a little personality compared to more recent vintages, but it is still a pleasurable Bonnes-Mares, albeit one I would not buy given present inflated secondary market prices.

1935,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"This is the first time that I have encountered this vintage of Bonnes-Mares. It has a superb, quite voluptuous bouquet with precise, small dark cherries, boysenberry and fresh strawberry fruit that are packed tightly together. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy brambly fruit, perhaps a little simple compared to other vintages (especially more recent ones) but quite “punchy” and bold. Although it does not possess that frisson of excitement you often find with Christophe’s wines, you could see this lasting another 10 years and perhaps mustering more secondary aromas and flavours.

1936,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Roumier’s 2009 Bonnes-Mares is without question one of the wines of the vintage. Firm yet beautifully integrated tannins provide the backdrop for the highly nuanced, expressive aromas and flavors that emerge from the glass. All the elements are in the right place in this extraordinary, moving wine. At times the Bonnes-Mares comes across as very powerful, at other times it is quite sensual. In other words, it is pure magic in the glass. Burgundy fans will flock to the Musigny because of its rarity but there is a very real possibility that the Bonnes-Mares will outshine it over time. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.

1937,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2009 Musigny is breathtakingly beautiful. Of course it is far too young, but the wine’s pedigree is impossible to miss. At the same time, it is also impossible to ignore the challenges of making wines in tiny lots, such as the Musigny, of which there are just one and half barrels. In two separate tastings, the Bonnes-Mares, which is made on a large scale here, proved to be more consistent than the Musigny. There is no question the Musigny is phenomenal, but I am not sure it is worth the risk considering a price that is now in excess of $5,000 a bottle. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.

Anticipated maturity: 2019-2029.  

It is a fascinating to revisit Christophe Roumier’s 2009s from bottle. The lower-end wines are marked by the year to a significantly greater extent than the top wines.

There is wonderful depth to the fruit as the wine continues to open up in the glass. This is a decidedly dark, powerful style of Chambolle, but it works, and quite beautifully, too. It will be interesting to see the direction the Combottes takes over the coming years. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024.

1944,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"The 2010 Bonnes-Mares is explosive and totally exciting. A big, broad- shouldered frame supports a core of black fruit, mint, flowers and licorice in this powerful, massively structured wine. Here, too, it is the wine’s energy and focus that truly stand out most. The finish turns weightless and totally sublime. As usual, I tasted the Bonnes-Mares from its two main components, and then in the blend, and it was the blend that was most convincing of the three wines. The 2010 Bonnes-Mares is a wine built for a long rest in the cellar before it begins to approach the early part of what promises to be a long drinking window. Anticipated maturity: 2025-2050.

1960,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"Given that there is as usual for this bottling only a barrique and a half of Roumier's 2008 Musigny, neither barrel is new. This was vinified entirely vendange entier, and had been bottled for only three weeks when I tasted it in February. Haunting, high-toned scents of kirsch, rowan, lily, heliotrope, and cinnamon lead to a bright, searching palate impression piquantly tinged with cherry pit, brown spices, and underlain with dark forest floor emanations. Ultra-fine tannins and a deep, umami-rich meaty finishing savor take this startlingly far from the ""fruit syrup"" expression of de Vogue's equally impressive Musigny of the vintage. But along with all of the best 2008s, this displays terrific - in this instance low-toned, reverberative - finishing energy. 

Christophe Roumier says his 2008 fruit demanded rigorous sorting to remove under-ripe bunches (whereas in 2007 this was necessary to remove rot), but he liked what was left enough to indulge in a significant proportion (most frequently 50%) of stems and whole clusters for the fermentations. ""With such tiny, perfect berries, it was almost a shame to de-stem any of them,"" he remarks. Late to go through malo, like so many others of that year, these 2008s certainly preserve the vintage's primary virtues of vivacity and interactive complexity. Not more than 50% new wood was employed, to guard against loss of the vintage's vividly bright fruit in a vintage Roumier felt was unusually sensitive in that regard. Some of the 2008s remind him of 1980 or, more precisely, of what the 1980s could have become given today's standards of viticulture and selection. Roumier has a higher opinion of 2007 and their age-worthiness than do I, considering them superior to 2006 or 2008 - and given the way the two that I tasted from bottle showed, that opinion is not inexplicable. (I tasted the other Roumier 2007s too early in their evolution to render proper verdicts, although they were certainly effusively generous if not yet complex even pre-malo.) Roumier employed comparable percentages of stems and whole clusters, and indulged in more frequent pigeage than in 2008, comparing his resulting 2007s with 1985s.

There is a certain textural austerity and restraint of sheer ripeness here, but what a concentrated ball of energy we have, making for a finish of spine- as well as tongue-tingling length!

1962,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Roumier's 2008 Charmes-Chambertin (from Mazoyeres), suggests - even on the nose - sauteed sweetbreads in its savory carnality, accompanied by ripe, fresh cherry. Hints of oregano, cherry pit bitterness, and alkali as well as chalk dust make for a cooling, slightly aloof aspect to this Pinot entirely free of superficial sweetness. A saliva-inducing salinity helps convey a more winsome message, but abundant if fine-grained tannins also suggest restraint. I would want to revisit this in a few years before attempting to predict a useful bottle life of more than a decade, though it's entirely possible that it was still suffering some post-bottling trauma when I tasted it in February.

Forest floor and clean meaty elements as well as hints of cinnamon and nutmeg emerge as this opens to the air, all nicely complimenting the wine's fresh fruit edge, as does its incipiently silken texture. This finishes long and vibrant, with alluring spice and pure fruit. I would plan to enjoy it over the next half dozen years.

1964,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"As in 2005, there are one and a half barriques' (but a whole lot of Euros!) worth of Roumier 2006 Musigny. Liqueur-like kirsch and framboise, white truffle, peony, iris, and rich, savory meat stock fill the nose and carry onto an almost velvety palate that for all of its unctuousness displays dynamic interaction of flavors and uncanny lift. White pepper pungency and saline, meaty savor add to the invigoration and saliva-inducing allure of a long finish. While this cannot boast the concentration and structure of the 2005, its virtues are otherwise similarly prodigious. And one might well ask how much structure is needed to carry a wine like this - already soaring - over the next decade and beyond?

Rigorous triage - along with Christophe Roumier's seemingly intuitive sense for the limits and potential of the vintage - have resulted in a set of 2006s here that are youthfully generous, but in the best instances will be well worth cellaring. The fermentative regimen and elevage (including no racking until assemblage, to maximize contact with lees convey both fat and structure; yet early bottling to preserve fruit) were tailored to the vintage, whereas the regimen of new wood was little changed from other recent years, meaning around one-third for the premier crus. Stems were selectively included, up to something over one-third in the grand crus.

1965,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"A haunting bouquet of iris and heliotrope; ripe, fresh red raspberry and cherry along with their spirituous proxies; and brown spices fills the nose from Roumier's 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Les Amoureuses, which offers a similarly ravishing palate display, silken in texture and underlain by metaphorically cool chalkiness and rich meat stock. The finish here preserves white-wine like clarity to floral and mineral nuances yet with powerful resonance, as well as buoyancy and sheer refreshment. I would anticipate its remaining ravishing for at least a decade.  

Rigorous triage - along with Christophe Roumier's seemingly intuitive sense for the limits and potential of the vintage - have resulted in a set of 2006s here that are youthfully generous, but in the best instances will be well worth cellaring. The fermentative regimen and elevage (including no racking until assemblage, to maximize contact with lees convey both fat and structure; yet early bottling to preserve fruit) were tailored to the vintage, whereas the regimen of new wood was little changed from other recent years, meaning around one-third for the premier crus. Stems were selectively included, up to something over one-third in the grand crus.

1966,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Pungent incense, and herbal concentrates; ginger and cinnamon; kirsch and framboise distillates, along with their dark flesh-and-juice fresh counterparts, all practically assault the nose from Roumier's 2006 Bonnes Mares. This saturates the palate with sweet ripeness and liqueur-like textural richness, while cherry pit, black pepper, and peat offer counterpoint. A savory carnal undertone adds another intriguing dimension. The concentration and resonance of spices, herbs and fruit in the finish is superb. Here is a Bonnes Mares much more complex and dynamic at this youthful stage than the majority. In fact, I can't see that it would be a crime to drink some young, although it should age well for at least a dozen years.

1967,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras,"A complex aromatic melange of smoked meat; sauteed mushroom; diverse, lightly-cooked berries; and nutmeg greets the taster from the glass of Roumier 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Les Cras. A tart edge to the fruit and savory salinity lend some of the same invigoration that characterized other wines in this collection, but here allied to deep meatiness and an underlying impression of wet stone. The tannins are superbly refined and the finish penetrating and dynamic in its interplay of fungal, fruity, mineral, carnal, and spicy notes. Here is another instance of the vigor and almost airy openness of the vintage beautifully expressed. I suspect this will be worth following for 6-8 years, but make sure not to deprive yourself of the pleasure of its youthful charms.

1968,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Decidedly well-hung notes of game first reach the nose from Roumier's 2006 Ruchottes-Chambertin, although sweetly ripe raspberry and cherry come flooding after. A balance between fruit and gaminess is maintained on the palate, and unlike the Charmes, this is polished in texture, if not notably transparent to nuance. The finish here is quite powerful in fact, carrying with it a hint of heat. More intriguing complexity emerges as this takes on air - one of several hints that it's still a bit reduced - and I suspect that in addition to short-term evolution it needs 2-3 years in bottle to show at its best, after which it should remain worth following for at least a half dozen more.

1970,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Smoky and carnal in the nose, with more typical red fruits, licorice, and rose petals emerging with air, Roumier's 2006 Charmes-Chambertin (actually form Mazoyeres), comes to the palate with a sense of ample ripeness but opacity of fruit and slightly awkward astringency that might represent a legacy of hail (and that were evident in cask as well as from bottle). There is richness here that just can't fully express itself, and the sense of meatiness is impressively profound. This should really be revisited in 2010 to attempt a proper assessment of its longer-term future.

1971,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Combottes,"Roumier's 2006 Chambolle-Musigny Les Combottes - from a tiny cru just north of Charmes - features tart red raspberry, smoked meat, sage, brown spices, and hints of white pepper on the nose; offers a more roasted, low-toned meatiness than the corresponding Clos de la Bussiere; and finishes with a highly invigorating combination of salinity and fresh berry tartness. Perhaps due to the presence of a cocktail of modern clones in the half of this site that is planted with very young vines (and all of whose fruit was de-stemmed), this is the highest in alcohol - at 14% - in its collection, but I must say there are no ill-effects. While not downright silken as was the Clos de la Bussiere, its tannins are certainly fine-grained. I would plan to enjoy this over the next 4-6 years.

1974,Domaine Georges Roumier,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The four barrels of Christophe Roumier’s 2006 Corton-Charlemagne (from the western, En Charlemagne terminus and original white grape sector of this grand cru) completed their malo-lactic transformation in late Spring of the following year, but it was the end of the summer before they finished alcoholic fermentation. Just prior to bottling, this displayed an impressive combination of depth and clarity of flavor with a positively airy, wafting elegance. Apple blossom, honeysuckle, white peach, lime, toasted nuts, and crushed stone all seem to rise from the glass. A tender, soothing texture and continued abundance of floral perfume, put fruits, citrus, and minerals greets the palate, and the long finish manages to remain refreshing and full of lift – not to mention open and accessible – yet deeply layered, the stony mineral elements uniting with a mysteriously sweet and saline savor. “What I really like is a wine that’s very elegant and graceful, but at the same time very rich.” The virtues of his 2006 could not have been better summarized. Despite its youthful generosity, I suspect it will be worthy of at least 8-10 years’ cellaring.

1975,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"There will sadly be fewer than forty cases of 2005 Musigny, which displays pristine ripe and distilled red berry fruit, herbal and bitter-sweet citrus zest and floral essences, and mysterious intimations of meat and minerals on the nose. In the mouth, this offers polished, melting tannins and creaminess of texture; clarity, vivacity and intensity of sweet, ripe red fruits; persistent iris and violet florality; deep, marrowy meatiness; and a dynamic exchange with subtly tactile suggestions of white pepper, chalk dust, and wet stone such as – other than Pinot – only a great Riesling can give.

1976,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,"Roumier vinifies separately and later assembles the fruits of white chalk and red (iron-rich) parcels that inform his 2005 Bonnes Mares. At the time of my visit he had retained one pure barrel of each component as an investigation into terroir and the results were as fascinating as the blended wine is fascinatingly and profoundly beautiful. The ferrous lot (55% of the final assemblage) displays ripe blackberry and raspberry berries, along with (red soil-born) pungent smokiness, Chartreuse-like herbal and floral essences. A liqueur-like presentation of black fruits temporarily overshadows the mysterious (white rock-born) meld of chalky minerality and beef marrow that wells up gradually on a creamy palate with tannins of utmost refinement. The tension and energy are riveting – lending the wine a dynamic, fleet-of-foot impression for all of its manifestly huge extract – with incisive brightness of palate-staining fruit and vibrant minerality leading to a finish of sensational clarity and length. Even here, by the way, Roumier employs only around 40% new wood.

There are certainly indications of this in the glass, but the wine is suffering from a slight, temporary reduction. This enhances the gamey and smoky side of the nose, but there is ample concentration of black raspberry along with narcissus and iris florality as well. In the mouth, one is rewarded with prodigious, persistent, fascinatingly complex animality and floral perfume, pointed ripe-yet-tart black fruits, a fine-grained structure, and palpable mineral extract. The finish is strikingly energetic and penetrating, even though one senses a slight reductive corset on the fruit. This will certainly become a profound wine, best revisited only after a decade in bottle.

1983,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"Aptly illustrating how deeply the quality of this vintage can run, Roumier’s 2005 Bourgogne (from vineyards below Chambolle) is full of infectiously juicy, primary, tart blackberry fruit – exuberant despite very recent bottling – exhibits remarkable florality, density, refined tannins, and silken texture for a generic Pinot, and finishes straight and long, with subtle, low-toned suggestions of roasted meat, and invigorating fruit skin tartness and hints of salt. This represents an excellent value, but in truth that could be said of the Grand Cru end of Roumier’s line-up as well (at least based on their suggested retails – though finding any will be the trick!).

Bright cherry fruit, undertones of roast beef, and persistent inner-mouth florality lead into a refined, long, attractively lean finish, revealing abundant but sophisticated tannins that will help justify at least 3-5 years in the cellar.

Here Roumier interjected that the 2003s “took on springiness and vigor during elevage,” something many vignerons reported.

It bursts from the glass with stupendous, mouth-watering aromas of kirsch, candied cherries, perfume, flowers, and Asian spices. On the palate it is silky-textured, lush, medium-bodied, and sweet.

While all that seems positive, certainly meriting an outstanding score, this wine’s most striking feature is its lack of harmony: the parts are substantially more appealing than the whole. It does not appear to be worthy of extended cellaring, yet it is quite possible this wine could come together with some bottle age. Try it between 2005 and 2012.

1998,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"Roumier elected to perform the elevage of his entire 2002 Musigny production in one new 350 liter barrel. Fulfilling every winemaker’s nightmare, the barrel’s toasting was flawed by the cooperage, according to Roumier, marring the wine with excessively toasty aromas and flavors. Christophe quickly racked it into a used 228-liter traditional barrel and an older 114 liter one but the damage was done. When tasted, it exhibited a tight, rough, light-bodied character (perhaps from the quick racking) as well as the charred barrel scents and flavors.

2031,Domaine Georges Roumier,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"This deep ruby-colored wine reveals a super nose of sweet and creamed cherries leading to a tangy, medium-bodied, and vibrant core of raspberries and red currants. This delicious wine should be consumed over the next 2-3 years.

Roumier informed me he was planning to bottle his 1996s earlier than usual to ""trap the fruit."" He is of the opinion that they will not be exuberant, charming, and seductive following bottling. Virtually every vigneron agreed that the 1996s have been a delight to drink from the moment the grapes were pressed. Yet Roumier thinks they will need years to be expressive. Those 1996s that I have tasted stateside have maintained their forward, fruity character, but time will tell.

2032,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"Red Burgundy enthusiasts will have to fight, cajole, beg and plead to get some of Roumier's 1995 Musigny ( with a total production of only 400 bottles, 180 will be imported to the US through normal channels). This is an utterly mind-blowing wine! The robe is super-dark with touches of purple (similar to a high class Northern Rhone.). When I raised the glass to my nose I felt like I had fallen into a blueberry-filled well lined with sweet, dark violets. I've rarely experienced such sublime aromatics. This hyper-structured and extraordinarily balanced wine is jam-packed with gorgeously concentrated and floral ripe dark berries. The finish is as long as any Burgundy I've had (including those from Leroy!). Full-bodied, powerful, thick-textured and stunningly elegant, this is a show-stopping sumptuous Burgundy that should be cellared for at least 8 years. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2020.

This note is the result of tastings I did in Burgundy between January 7 and January 29. The wine was tasted from cask, not bottle. Pinot Noir, a fragile varietal, reacts poorly to fining, filtration, and careless bottling techniques, I recommend caution when considering buying a red burgundy based on cask samples. I called it as I tasted it, and hope the bottled wine reflects the quality of the samples I was provided.

The harvest took place here on September 29 for the Corton-Charlemagne and between October 2 and 9 for the reds. Yields averaged 28 hectoliters/hectare.

Overall, Roumier's 1995s are stunning wines. They have breathtaking ripeness of fruit, elegance, power and texture. Bravo!

Roumier's 1995 offering is a persuasive example of this vineyard's potential. Dark ruby-colored, it explodes from the glass with powerful scents of dark berries. A spectacular wine, it is packed with blueberry flavor.

Although this is one of Burgundy's finest domaines, and a reference point for quality in most vintages, Roumier's 1991s are less successful than other top Cote de Nuits producers'.  The yields were minuscule, ranging from 8-10 hectoliters per hectare, to 16-20 hectoliters per hectare for several of the grand crus.  Though well-colored, the wines tend to be hard, tannic, and lacking the intensity of fruit necessary to match the tannin.  Like some other 1991s, the balance between tannin and fruit is questionable.  My experience has shown that the fruit usually fades more quickly than the tannin.

2061,Domaine Georges Roumier,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Musigny displayed great fruit, elegance, and a tremendous aromatic penetration. It had nowhere near the weight of either the Bonnes Mares Cuvee Vieilles Vignes or Ruchottes-Chambertin, but made up for that deficiency with its sheer velvety elegance and charm. It should drink beautifully young, but will age gracefully for up to a decade.",,RP 91
2062,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Ruchottes-Chambertin is a muscular, full-bodied, highly extracted and flavorful wine with a great deal of character. In fact, some people feel it suffers from too much complexity. There is a sweet, leathery, almost ground beef and soy sauce aroma, and long, tannic, powerful, heady flavors. This wine should be laid away for at least 4-5 years and consumed over the following 15. It should prove to be one of the longest-lived wines of the vintage.",,RP 91
2063,Domaine Georges Roumier,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"The 1988 Chambolle-Musigny Les Amoureuses is superb, with outstanding extract, a long, fleshy, seductive palate impression, and an excellent bouquet of red fruits and spicy new oak. It is delicious enough to drink young, but is capable of lasting for up to a decade.",,RP 91
2064,Domaine Georges Roumier,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Charmes-Chambertin is impossible to find as the entire production is sold in Switzerland. They have only been making the wine since 1984, and the 1988, should anyone be lucky enough to find a bottle in Zurich or Geneva, is well worth buying.

2069,Domaine Georges Roumier,Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"One of the best-kept secrets of this domaine is the Ruchottes-Chambertin, normally the largest-scaled wine the Roumiers produce.

2100,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"Bottled in July of last year, the 2015 Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche is a daring and absolutely profound expression of Nebbiolo with the depth, thickness and volume you can expect from a warm vintage such as this. This wine is a veritable bomb of aromatic intensity with thick layers of dark fruit, spice and crushed stone that all vie for your attention in equal measure. The mouthfeel is characterized by thick fiber and lasting succulence, all capped with fresh acidity and a firm tannic backbone. This Barolo is classic Giacosa.",,RP 93
2101,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"This red label Riserva was made in 2012 and 2014 and will be released in 2016 and 2017. Bruna Giacosa and her team skipped over 2013 and 2015. However, the current release is the 2014 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche, and well, there's a lot to take in. Simply put, this is a beautiful wine that unfolds slowly with amazing intensity and complexity, delivering delicate notes of violets and candied orange peel that cede softly to darker tones of licorice, dried blackberry and savory spice. Give the wine the time it needs to open in the glass. This vintage flaunts its most elegant side, with fine tannins and soft fruity fiber that remains everlasting and pure. This estate is known for taking its biggest chances in the so-called off vintages. Betting on 2014 has turned out to be a brilliantly contemplated move.",,RP 93
2102,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"From a hot vintage, the 2017 Roero Arneis is a rich and pulpy white wine with bright fruit definition. The bouquet delivers tropical fruit, papaya and apricot. The mouthfeel is rich with thick fruit flavors. This vintage shows superior structure. But an expert winemaking hand is clearly at play, because that sunny ripeness falls short of tasting jammy or too heavy. Bruna Giacosa tells me that because of reduced yields, it proved challenging to source enough fruit to make this wine. Drink this fruit-forward white wine within the next few years.",,RP 93
2103,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,"I am a huge fan of this vineyard site in the Roero region. The 2016 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore serves to encourage and confirm my enthusiasm. The Valmaggiore vineyard is home to dangerously steep rows that make farming extremely laborious. The effort is worth it, especially when you consider those delicate and nuanced berry aromas that so beautifully permeate the bouquet. Wild strawberry, cassis and blueberry are followed by pressed violet and bitter almond. Nor is the mouthfeel to be underestimated, as it provides ample structure and extra crunch on the tonic finish. This wine was bottled just three weeks prior to my tasting and is developing handsomely.",,RP 93
2104,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"In 2013, the father and daughter winemaking team of Bruno and Bruna Giacosa decided not to produce their Barbaresco Asili. They made a Rabajà expression instead. Asili was vinified separately again in 2014 and more recently to create the impressive 2015 Barbaresco Asili. This wine was bottled one year ago in July and has been on the market since February. This expression offers accessible and generous fruit tones, with blackcurrant and dark plum. The wine delivers big inner power with evident tannic firmness and a point of astringency on the finish. All it needs is more time in the bottle.",,RP 93
2105,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"Packaged in its distinctive red label (red is for Riserva), the 2014 Barbaresco Riserva Asili represents a tremendous effort in a challenging but ultimately very rewarding vintage. This wine will be released in February 2019. The previous edition was 2011, and Bruna Giacosa tells me that it will be produced in 2016 and possibly 2017—although this has not yet been officially confirmed. In a normal vintage, production is 11,000 bottles strong, but because of reduced yields in 2014 we can expect some 8,000 bottles instead. Growing conditions in 2014 were cause for concern up until the end of August because of humidity and below average temperatures. Those conditions changed suddenly in the nick of time, bringing strong sunshine and warmth during the final stage of grape ripening. Ultimately, 2014 proved to be a long growing season with healthy fruit in reduced volume. The Rabajà cru sometimes shows a harder edge with more mineral definition. Asili, in comparison, offers gorgeous intensity and profound depth. This Riserva shows seamless integration of wild fruit, blue flower, spice, balsam herb and pencil shaving. This is a complete and complex expression with an enduring sense of dimension and structure. I can’t wait to taste this wine one day in the far future when it is further along on its promising evolutionary track.",,RP 93
2106,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"This is the second year in which this wine was made with estate fruit (opposed to purchased fruit). Bruna Giacosa calls the 2014 Barbaresco Rabajà her “little miracle wine.” The Rabajà cru is very close to Asili, but indeed, the two corresponding wines are extremely different in character. This expression offers black fruit intensity, with sharp and classic lines. Rabajà tends to be closed in its younger years and needs extra aging time before it finds its voice. The mouthfeel is dense, brooding and slightly austere at this point. Ten additional years of cellar aging should be considered at a minimum.",,RP 93
2107,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"This wine was made in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013. The 2014 Barolo Falletto (white label) is fascinating to taste right after the Barbaresco Riserva Asili from the same vintage. There is no doubting the extra muscle mass and power that is obtained in the Barolo appellation, and from the Serralunga d’Alba township specifically. This dramatic Barolo delivers darkness and density. It shows a beautiful appearance with faint highlights of dark ruby that add a subtle sparkle. At this point in its drinking cycle, the wine shows all the characteristic traits of its youth. This means it is more closed and rigid at present. That nervous tightness needs to be factored in when assessing the cellar longevity of this vintage. Hints of the wine’s inner complexity, sheer determination and textural fortitude are already bubbling up from deep inside this firmly layered Nebbiolo. I wanted to mention the tightness of the tannins now. These will undoubtedly serve to carry this wine forward over the coming decades.",,RP 93
2108,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2012 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche (red label) was bottled last September and has already eased into a comfortable and promising stage in its very early evolution. Bruna Giacosa tells me that this wine will be made in 2014 and 2016, so future supplies are plentiful. The jury is out on whether the wine will be produced in 2015, but Bruna tells me it is unlikely (albeit by no means confirmed at this point). Fruit selection was extreme in 2012. This is a warm vintage expression, and the wine is beautifully rich and velvety as a result. That textural richness is what stands out most. The primary fruit is bold and very well defined. There is a point of dark cherry ripeness, but it adds to the generous fiber and softness of the mouthfeel. Of the many beautiful vintages I have tasted of this wine, I suspect the 2012 might be faster in its evolution.",,RP 93
2109,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The 2016 Roero Arneis was bottled on Saint Valentine's Day and that's a fitting touch. Some 140,000 bottles were made, which is more than average. This is a fresh and buoyant wine that is loaded with tangy tropical fruit, pineapple and honeydew melon. The wine's intensity is exuberant, pronounced and refreshing. Dustings of fine mineral and salty limestone characteristics give the wine a brilliant sense of polish and crispness. Bruna Giacosa tells me the fruit harvested in 2016 was beautiful. She distinctly remembers the perfumes of the Arneis grapes as they came into the winery on the back of a truck during harvest. This is a beautiful white wine.",,RP 93
2110,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2016 Dolcetto d'Alba opens to a vinous and foxy nose of black cherry and raw fruit. The wine reveals a saturated ruby color with blackish coloring at the edges. This vintage delivers an extraordinary sense of varietal purity. Grapes used to make this wine were purchased from outside farmers located in the Neive township. I tasted this wine less than a week after it was bottled, but the underlying potential of the fruit is apparent.",,RP 93
2111,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,The Valmaggiore vineyard in the Roero appellation is one of the hottest spots for grape-growing in Piedmont today. Fruit coming out of this site has been exceptional these past few years. The 2015 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigne Valmaggiore shows a youthful personality with fresh primary fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry followed by red rose and pressed violet. The Roero area is characterized by sandy soils so those floral perfumes are very pronounced and intense. Bruna Giacosa just signed a ten-year lease on this site meaning she now manages all the farming needs in-house. The Valmaggiore cru awards us with a different and equally exciting perspective onto the Nebbiolo grape.,,RP 93
2112,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco,"This is a difficult wine to find in the marketplace and it is rarely presented for official review. In fact, the last time it was produced was way back in 2008. The 2014 Barbaresco sees fruit sourced from the lower part of the Asili cru with some smaller amounts from Rabajà. This is a very opulent and rich expression with forward determination and power. This is an unusual vintage with a cool summer and a very warm pre-harvest period. It produced interesting wines specifically in Barbaresco and almost nowhere else in Northern Italy. The quality of fruit is ripe and a touch sweet. Its texture is succulent and soft. The wine feels like it could be ready to drink now, but it also has the pedigree and beautiful inner structure for long cellar aging.",,RP 93
2113,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The recent evolution of this wine is a bit confusing. After the 2009 Barolo le Rocche del Falletto was released, the wine was not made in 2010 or 2011. The following year, we got the 2012 Barolo Falletto that I scored last year. We now return to the series with the 2013 Barolo Falleto Vigna Le Rocche—which is, of course, the white label wine. The wine shows extremely elegant and fine characteristics with a dry and streamlined approach. Fruit tones on offer are delicate and nuanced. White truffle, balsam herb, violet and licorice are folded within. The wine was a little reticent when I tasted it and it definitely needs more time to flesh out in the bottle.",,RP 93
2114,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"This is the exciting new wine being presented by the Bruno Giacosa estate this year. The 2013 Barbaresco Rabajà comes from a half-hectare parcel purchased by Bruna Giacosa (Bruno's daughter) in 2013. Past incarnations of this wine were made with fruit that has now become part of the Asili cru under the revised map of vineyard crus. In other words, the name of the wine is technically the same, but the grapes used to make it are sourced from a different place starting with this vintage. This is a darkly enriched expression with ample power and muscle. The bouquet pours forth a beautiful array of dark fruit aromas with spice, smoke, laurel leaf and balsam herb. There's even a touch of aged cheddar or pecorino cheese that adds a spicy or piquant touch to the finish.",,RP 93
2115,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"Here we have the venerated red label. The Bruno Giacosa 2011 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigne Le Rocche commands attention and respect. The wine successfully, and somewhat magically, turns the tables on the overdone exuberance of the warm vintage and the natural heft that is inherent to Serralunga d'Alba. It does a great job of reining in all that power and transforming it into streamlined elegance instead.  The wine opens to a dark and penetrating color and an immediately expressive bouquet. Thick layers of dark fruit, iron-rich earth, balsam herb, Darjeeling tea, dried ginger and cherry cola rise from the bouquet. The wine's Falletto signature is very strong. This is a Grande Vino with the proverbial capital G and capital V.",,RP 93
2116,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The Bruno Giacosa 2015 Roero Arneis is a mineral-driven and beautifully fresh white wine that would taste great on a warm summer evening. The wine sports a luminous golden color that seems slightly more intense in this vintage. The bouquet offers citrus, peach, dried sage and crushed oyster shell. In the mouth, the wine is tangy and crisp. ",,RP 93
2117,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2015 Dolcetto d'Alba opens to a very fruity bouquet with ripe cherry and raspberry on prominent display. The wine offers immediate appeal and dark cherry that spills over into tilled earth and button mushroom. The Dolcetto grape doesn't offer much tannic support, but this wine offers noticeable firmness nonetheless. This was not an easy vintage for Dolcetto, but the winemaking team at the Giacosa winery took extra steps to safeguard the integrity of the fruit. ",,RP 93
2118,Bruno Giacosa,Barbera d'Alba Falletto,"This wine was produced in 2012, but the Giacosa family decided to skip over the very difficult 2013 (especially difficult for Barbera) vintage. The 2014 Barbera d'Alba Falletto is made with estate fruit and shows the power and heft of Serralunga d'Alba. This is a more structured expression with good depth and a generous offering of dark fruit flavors. The finish is marked by a crisp spot of balanced acidity. ",,RP 93
2119,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The Bruno Giacosa 2021 Roero Arneis is an especially luminous and fresh white wine that is packed with tropical fruits and floral notes. There is great freshness, and the wine reveals an elegant mineral signature. Production was reduced in this vintage (with some 150,000 bottles created) and even more so in 2022 due to the heat. Fruit for this wine is purchased in the neighboring Roero appellation. Harvest took place on September 17th, and the wine fermented in stainless steel at 16 degrees Celsius, lasting 15 to 20 days. It remained in contact with the fine lees for three months.",,RP 93
2120,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,"Cherry, bright berry and cassis emerge from the Bruno Giacosa 2020 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore. This is a somewhat looser, more open-knit approach to Nebbiolo that offers a delightful, fruit-forward mouthfeel that is characterized by moments of delicate softness and, alternatively, bright freshness. Blue flowers and violets appear on the close.",,RP 93
2121,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"With the white label, the 2019 Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche is a generous and expansive wine that hits the palate from all sides. It offers lingering sensations of sweet fruit with a good amount of intensity and muscle power pushing from behind. That forward momentum is fueled by dark fruit, rusty earth, wet clay and blood orange. It shows elegance, substance and finely tuned tones with considerable tension and tightness. This is another bottle to rest at the back of your cellar.",,RP 93
2122,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"Next to the Asili, the Bruno Giacosa 2019 Barbaresco Rabajà has even more structure and power, promising more longevity too. Thanks to the wine's natural tannic grip and structure, I suggest a longer drinking window for this expression. The Rabajà will require more time in bottle. At this young stage, it displays a pretty ensemble of dark berries, crushed rose, white stone and dusty licorice root. Patience is required here.",,RP 93
2123,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"With the white label, the 2019 Barbaresco Asili is a wine of exceptional clarity and focus. That brightness is applied to the bouquet and the mouthfeel alike, where the wine feels streamlined, elegant and tight. Asili is redolent of wild fruit, violets and candied orange peel. This wine was bottled in 2021 and needs a few more years in glass before it really starts to unwind and soften.",,RP 93
2124,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"This year's top-end release from Bruno Giacosa is the 2017 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche (in the red label). Bottled in 2019, the wine stands apart thanks to a hot and dry growing season that Bruna Giacosa is very excited about. In fact, she prefers 2017 to 2015, although the two vintages do share similarities. This wine is very open-knit, and it reveals dark concentration in the form of ripe blackberry, candied cherry and spice. The tannins show a loose, granular quality that adds considerably to the textural impact of this Riserva.",,RP 93
2125,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The Giacosa family does a great job with its high-end wines and its entry-level products alike. The 2020 Roero Arneis is a great example of a wine that knocks out simplicity while maintaining a great sense of inner freshness and complexity. This was a great vintage for the popular Arneis white grape that shows a wide range of tropical perfumes with papaya, citrus and Williams pear. The wine also boasts rich inner fiber, good fruit weight and concentration. At this young stage, it is less defined by its inherent minerality and more defined by those exotic fruit tones. But you can expect the mineral tones to take on more importance a year or two from now.",,RP 93
2126,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"The Bruno Giacosa 2017 Barbaresco Rabajà is a fine and delicate wine that throws a curveball at our expectations of this notoriously hot and dry vintage. The wine is exceedingly generous when it comes to its fruit, especially its blackcurrant and plum, but what steals the show is that elegant mineral note that so seamlessly cedes to spice, licorice and cinnamon. Rabajà is one of the most distinctive growing sites in Barbaresco, thanks to its white stony soils that leave such a strong imprint on its wines. The wine is remarkable for its nicely linear and delicate style, but it ultimately proves its power and determination on the palate over many long minutes.",,RP 93
2127,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The Bruno Giacosa 2016 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche sees its fruit sourced from the oldest vines in the Falletto cru. This wine boasts all the signature touches of Serralunga d'Alba with the massive structure, density and the long aging potential that comes with Nebbiolo grown in this village. The wine spreads evenly over the palate, imparting its considerable fruit weight and generally leaving a big impact. This Barolo is really quite lovely and beautiful. The bouquet is fluid and ever-shifting, showing new sides with firm fruit, blackberry, smoke, rusty nail and mineral with every swirl of the glass. I visited this vineyard site shortly before tasting this wine and marveled at the beautiful peacocks that roam free between the rows of vines.",,RP 93
2128,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"Packaged in its distinctive red label, the 2016 Barbaresco Riserva Asili is a rich and profound wine with incredible depth and dimension. Bruna Giacosa skipped over the 2015 vintage because she felt that the fruit was not poised for long aging. From the 2014 vintage, we jump to this 2016 expression, a wine that Bruna says reminds her of the epic 2001 and 2004 vintages. She also loves the 2017 vintage, which I look forward to tasting next year. This wine is incredibly precise and sharp; however, the volume and generous fruit weight promises a long aging future. The aromas veer toward red berry, cherry and cassis, and the darker black fruit tones that you might expect are less prominent in the Asili. The wine majestically captures the elegance and the power of this iconic vintage. Production is 11,000 bottles, 1,500 magnums and 200 Jeroboams.",,RP 93
2129,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"The Bruno Giacosa 2016 Barolo Falletto (white label) brings us another extraordinary expression from a classic vintage. Serralunga d'Alba fruit is full, generous and thickly layered in a manner that you always hope to encounter when lucky enough to drink pedigree Nebbiolo. There is enormous density here and power and grace; however, the Barolo Falletto is seemingly weightless and ever so delicate as it warms smoothly over the senses. Crisp cherry and blackberry are followed by delicate tones of crushed stone and iron ore. Bright tones of grilled herb and blue flower lift gently from the bouquet and add to the balanced intensity of this collectors' vintage.",,RP 93
2130,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"I tasted this wine next to the 2017 vintage, and the differences between the two growing seasons are remarkable. The 2017 expression is open, more accessible and singing from the glass. However, the Bruno Giacosa 2016 Barbaresco Rabajà is certainly more reserved and timid if tasted now. The wine opens to beautiful richness, saturation and concentration. There is plenty of dark fruit and bright cherry with ample textural richness that is followed by sweet tannins and an attractively tight or firm structure. Saline or mineral notes give the wine sharpness and added dimension. It has all its cards in place for long aging, and the wine most certainly needs more time in the bottle.",,RP 93
2131,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The 2018 Roero Arneis is a fragrant and linear white wine with plenty of spicy lemon, tangerine and crushed stone aromas. The 2017 vintage of this wine (from a hotter vintage) showed more tropical fruit, whereas this cooler vintage offers more citrus and mineral notes. Bruna Giacosa tells me that she prefers 2017 over this 2018; however, it's all a matter of personal choice. I am partial to this vintage because of those tangy flavors and the wine's precisely linear quality. However, this wine is set to flesh out and gain in volume after the summer because Arneis starts to show its best results in September following the harvest.",,RP 93
2132,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,"The 2017 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore is hitting the market as I write this review. The Giacosa family never made a Langhe Nebbiolo and instead focused their efforts on a site-specific expression of Nebbiolo to fill in the lower end of their portfolio. The 2017 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore hails from an always over-performing site in Roero that is distinguished by floral notes and bright berry intensity. This hot vintage is more accessible and near term (compared to 2016); however, it offers plenty of that pretty floral intensity that makes Valmaggiore so special.",,RP 93
2133,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"This beautiful wine was released in January and is on the market now. The 2015 Barbaresco Rabajà benefits from one more year in the bottle (compared to its peers) to show expressive and exuberant intensity. The bouquet delivers a special floral note that resembles lady's perfume of fragrant rose potpourri, but these ethereal tones only last for the first minute or two. After that, you get a solid core of dark fruit with blackberry and dried cherry. The wine is nicely contoured by firm tannins and lasting acidity. The Rabajà vineyard site measures only half a hectare, and 3,600 bottles are made each year as a result.",,RP 93
2134,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"Bottled in July of last year, the 2015 Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche is a daring and absolutely profound expression of Nebbiolo with the depth, thickness and volume you can expect from a warm vintage such as this. This wine is a veritable bomb of aromatic intensity with thick layers of dark fruit, spice and crushed stone that all vie for your attention in equal measure. The mouthfeel is characterized by thick fiber and lasting succulence, all capped with fresh acidity and a firm tannic backbone. This Barolo is classic Giacosa.",,RP 93
2135,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"This red label Riserva was made in 2012 and 2014 and will be released in 2016 and 2017. Bruna Giacosa and her team skipped over 2013 and 2015. However, the current release is the 2014 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche, and well, there's a lot to take in. Simply put, this is a beautiful wine that unfolds slowly with amazing intensity and complexity, delivering delicate notes of violets and candied orange peel that cede softly to darker tones of licorice, dried blackberry and savory spice. Give the wine the time it needs to open in the glass. This vintage flaunts its most elegant side, with fine tannins and soft fruity fiber that remains everlasting and pure. This estate is known for taking its biggest chances in the so-called off vintages. Betting on 2014 has turned out to be a brilliantly contemplated move.",,RP 93
2136,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"From a hot vintage, the 2017 Roero Arneis is a rich and pulpy white wine with bright fruit definition. The bouquet delivers tropical fruit, papaya and apricot. The mouthfeel is rich with thick fruit flavors. This vintage shows superior structure. But an expert winemaking hand is clearly at play, because that sunny ripeness falls short of tasting jammy or too heavy. Bruna Giacosa tells me that because of reduced yields, it proved challenging to source enough fruit to make this wine. Drink this fruit-forward white wine within the next few years.",,RP 93
2137,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,"I am a huge fan of this vineyard site in the Roero region. The 2016 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore serves to encourage and confirm my enthusiasm. The Valmaggiore vineyard is home to dangerously steep rows that make farming extremely laborious. The effort is worth it, especially when you consider those delicate and nuanced berry aromas that so beautifully permeate the bouquet. Wild strawberry, cassis and blueberry are followed by pressed violet and bitter almond. Nor is the mouthfeel to be underestimated, as it provides ample structure and extra crunch on the tonic finish. This wine was bottled just three weeks prior to my tasting and is developing handsomely.",,RP 93
2138,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"In 2013, the father and daughter winemaking team of Bruno and Bruna Giacosa decided not to produce their Barbaresco Asili. They made a Rabajà expression instead. Asili was vinified separately again in 2014 and more recently to create the impressive 2015 Barbaresco Asili. This wine was bottled one year ago in July and has been on the market since February. This expression offers accessible and generous fruit tones, with blackcurrant and dark plum. The wine delivers big inner power with evident tannic firmness and a point of astringency on the finish. All it needs is more time in the bottle.",,RP 93
2139,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"Packaged in its distinctive red label (red is for Riserva), the 2014 Barbaresco Riserva Asili represents a tremendous effort in a challenging but ultimately very rewarding vintage. This wine will be released in February 2019. The previous edition was 2011, and Bruna Giacosa tells me that it will be produced in 2016 and possibly 2017—although this has not yet been officially confirmed. In a normal vintage, production is 11,000 bottles strong, but because of reduced yields in 2014 we can expect some 8,000 bottles instead. Growing conditions in 2014 were cause for concern up until the end of August because of humidity and below average temperatures. Those conditions changed suddenly in the nick of time, bringing strong sunshine and warmth during the final stage of grape ripening. Ultimately, 2014 proved to be a long growing season with healthy fruit in reduced volume. The Rabajà cru sometimes shows a harder edge with more mineral definition. Asili, in comparison, offers gorgeous intensity and profound depth. This Riserva shows seamless integration of wild fruit, blue flower, spice, balsam herb and pencil shaving. This is a complete and complex expression with an enduring sense of dimension and structure. I can’t wait to taste this wine one day in the far future when it is further along on its promising evolutionary track.",,RP 93
2140,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"This is the second year in which this wine was made with estate fruit (opposed to purchased fruit). Bruna Giacosa calls the 2014 Barbaresco Rabajà her “little miracle wine.” The Rabajà cru is very close to Asili, but indeed, the two corresponding wines are extremely different in character. This expression offers black fruit intensity, with sharp and classic lines. Rabajà tends to be closed in its younger years and needs extra aging time before it finds its voice. The mouthfeel is dense, brooding and slightly austere at this point. Ten additional years of cellar aging should be considered at a minimum.",,RP 93
2141,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"This wine was made in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013. The 2014 Barolo Falletto (white label) is fascinating to taste right after the Barbaresco Riserva Asili from the same vintage. There is no doubting the extra muscle mass and power that is obtained in the Barolo appellation, and from the Serralunga d’Alba township specifically. This dramatic Barolo delivers darkness and density. It shows a beautiful appearance with faint highlights of dark ruby that add a subtle sparkle. At this point in its drinking cycle, the wine shows all the characteristic traits of its youth. This means it is more closed and rigid at present. That nervous tightness needs to be factored in when assessing the cellar longevity of this vintage. Hints of the wine’s inner complexity, sheer determination and textural fortitude are already bubbling up from deep inside this firmly layered Nebbiolo. I wanted to mention the tightness of the tannins now. These will undoubtedly serve to carry this wine forward over the coming decades.",,RP 93
2142,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2012 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche (red label) was bottled last September and has already eased into a comfortable and promising stage in its very early evolution. Bruna Giacosa tells me that this wine will be made in 2014 and 2016, so future supplies are plentiful. The jury is out on whether the wine will be produced in 2015, but Bruna tells me it is unlikely (albeit by no means confirmed at this point). Fruit selection was extreme in 2012. This is a warm vintage expression, and the wine is beautifully rich and velvety as a result. That textural richness is what stands out most. The primary fruit is bold and very well defined. There is a point of dark cherry ripeness, but it adds to the generous fiber and softness of the mouthfeel. Of the many beautiful vintages I have tasted of this wine, I suspect the 2012 might be faster in its evolution.",,RP 93
2143,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The 2016 Roero Arneis was bottled on Saint Valentine's Day and that's a fitting touch. Some 140,000 bottles were made, which is more than average. This is a fresh and buoyant wine that is loaded with tangy tropical fruit, pineapple and honeydew melon. The wine's intensity is exuberant, pronounced and refreshing. Dustings of fine mineral and salty limestone characteristics give the wine a brilliant sense of polish and crispness. Bruna Giacosa tells me the fruit harvested in 2016 was beautiful. She distinctly remembers the perfumes of the Arneis grapes as they came into the winery on the back of a truck during harvest. This is a beautiful white wine.",,RP 93
2144,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2016 Dolcetto d'Alba opens to a vinous and foxy nose of black cherry and raw fruit. The wine reveals a saturated ruby color with blackish coloring at the edges. This vintage delivers an extraordinary sense of varietal purity. Grapes used to make this wine were purchased from outside farmers located in the Neive township. I tasted this wine less than a week after it was bottled, but the underlying potential of the fruit is apparent.",,RP 93
2145,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,The Valmaggiore vineyard in the Roero appellation is one of the hottest spots for grape-growing in Piedmont today. Fruit coming out of this site has been exceptional these past few years. The 2015 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigne Valmaggiore shows a youthful personality with fresh primary fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry followed by red rose and pressed violet. The Roero area is characterized by sandy soils so those floral perfumes are very pronounced and intense. Bruna Giacosa just signed a ten-year lease on this site meaning she now manages all the farming needs in-house. The Valmaggiore cru awards us with a different and equally exciting perspective onto the Nebbiolo grape.,,RP 93
2146,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco,"This is a difficult wine to find in the marketplace and it is rarely presented for official review. In fact, the last time it was produced was way back in 2008. The 2014 Barbaresco sees fruit sourced from the lower part of the Asili cru with some smaller amounts from Rabajà. This is a very opulent and rich expression with forward determination and power. This is an unusual vintage with a cool summer and a very warm pre-harvest period. It produced interesting wines specifically in Barbaresco and almost nowhere else in Northern Italy. The quality of fruit is ripe and a touch sweet. Its texture is succulent and soft. The wine feels like it could be ready to drink now, but it also has the pedigree and beautiful inner structure for long cellar aging.",,RP 93
2147,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The recent evolution of this wine is a bit confusing. After the 2009 Barolo le Rocche del Falletto was released, the wine was not made in 2010 or 2011. The following year, we got the 2012 Barolo Falletto that I scored last year. We now return to the series with the 2013 Barolo Falleto Vigna Le Rocche—which is, of course, the white label wine. The wine shows extremely elegant and fine characteristics with a dry and streamlined approach. Fruit tones on offer are delicate and nuanced. White truffle, balsam herb, violet and licorice are folded within. The wine was a little reticent when I tasted it and it definitely needs more time to flesh out in the bottle.",,RP 93
2148,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"This is the exciting new wine being presented by the Bruno Giacosa estate this year. The 2013 Barbaresco Rabajà comes from a half-hectare parcel purchased by Bruna Giacosa (Bruno's daughter) in 2013. Past incarnations of this wine were made with fruit that has now become part of the Asili cru under the revised map of vineyard crus. In other words, the name of the wine is technically the same, but the grapes used to make it are sourced from a different place starting with this vintage. This is a darkly enriched expression with ample power and muscle. The bouquet pours forth a beautiful array of dark fruit aromas with spice, smoke, laurel leaf and balsam herb. There's even a touch of aged cheddar or pecorino cheese that adds a spicy or piquant touch to the finish.",,RP 93
2149,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"Here we have the venerated red label. The Bruno Giacosa 2011 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigne Le Rocche commands attention and respect. The wine successfully, and somewhat magically, turns the tables on the overdone exuberance of the warm vintage and the natural heft that is inherent to Serralunga d'Alba. It does a great job of reining in all that power and transforming it into streamlined elegance instead.  The wine opens to a dark and penetrating color and an immediately expressive bouquet. Thick layers of dark fruit, iron-rich earth, balsam herb, Darjeeling tea, dried ginger and cherry cola rise from the bouquet. The wine's Falletto signature is very strong. This is a Grande Vino with the proverbial capital G and capital V.",,RP 93
2150,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"The Bruno Giacosa 2015 Roero Arneis is a mineral-driven and beautifully fresh white wine that would taste great on a warm summer evening. The wine sports a luminous golden color that seems slightly more intense in this vintage. The bouquet offers citrus, peach, dried sage and crushed oyster shell. In the mouth, the wine is tangy and crisp. ",,RP 93
2151,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2015 Dolcetto d'Alba opens to a very fruity bouquet with ripe cherry and raspberry on prominent display. The wine offers immediate appeal and dark cherry that spills over into tilled earth and button mushroom. The Dolcetto grape doesn't offer much tannic support, but this wine offers noticeable firmness nonetheless. This was not an easy vintage for Dolcetto, but the winemaking team at the Giacosa winery took extra steps to safeguard the integrity of the fruit. ",,RP 93
2152,Bruno Giacosa,Barbera d'Alba Falletto,"This wine was produced in 2012, but the Giacosa family decided to skip over the very difficult 2013 (especially difficult for Barbera) vintage. The 2014 Barbera d'Alba Falletto is made with estate fruit and shows the power and heft of Serralunga d'Alba. This is a more structured expression with good depth and a generous offering of dark fruit flavors. The finish is marked by a crisp spot of balanced acidity. ",,RP 93
2153,Bruno Giacosa,Barbera d'Alba,"The 2014 Barbera d'Alba is a clean and forthcoming wine that leaves a lasting impact on all the senses. The Giacosa family sources the fruit for this wine from the various time-trusted contractors they have worked with for years. The wine shows very good intensity and a pristine approach. These qualities are not easy to find in this vintage. 
",,RP 93
2154,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore,"Bruna Giacosa says that her family had a much easier time with Nebbiolo in 2014 compared to the other grapes they farm. The 2014 Nebbiolo d'Alba Vigna Valmaggiore is an elegant and forthcoming wine that drinks easily in the near-term, thanks to the balanced acidity and silky tannins it offers. The bouquet is laced with wild berry, blue flower and cola. The wine's structure is succulent and firm. In fact, the decisive firmness of this red comes as a pleasant surprise.",,RP 93
2155,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"The 2012 Barolo Falletto is a bit timid to open and needs extra time in the glass (especially when tasted this young). This wine was bottled in March. The wine already shows impressive complexity and depth with drying mineral notes that frame a pretty core of cherry and blackberry fruit. Background notes of light spice and grilled herb complete this pretty picture. What stands out most here, however, is the tight textural fabric of this wine. It is poised for very good aging potential. ",,RP 93
2156,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"The 2011 Barbaresco Riserva Asili (red label) is a full and generous wine that wraps thickly over the senses. The bouquet shows enormous depth and power with a generous presentation of dark fruit, cassis, balsam herb, cola, licorice, tar and lingering smoke. There is an evident sense of fruit ripeness here that helps to build momentum and staying power. Clay soils in the vineyard site have also helped to contribute to the heft and full-bodied nature of this special wine. The finish is characterized by mild acidity and lingering flavors of ripe fruit. The opulent fruit of the wine recalls the 2007 and 2004 vintages.",,RP 93
2157,Bruno Giacosa,Roero Arneis,"Bottled in February, the 2014 Roero Arneis offers a fresh bouquet of cut flowers, yellow fruit, pear and Golden Delicious apple. Bruna Giacosa tells me that 2014 was a good year in terms of aromas, but a weaker vintage in terms of mouthfeel. In fact, the palate shows thin lines and lean consistency. ",,RP 93
2158,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"The 2014 Dolcetto d'Alba was a difficult wine to make because heavy rainfall and low temperatures had a negative impact on the early-ripeneing Dolcetto grape. Maceration times were reduced to four days because the grape skins were so thin. Ultimately, the wine reaches good balance because bottling was put off by one month to give it more time to settle. In fact, this wine had been bottled just days before I tasted it. 
",,RP 93
2159,Bruno Giacosa,Nebbiolo d'Alba Valmaggiore,"The 2013 Nebbiolo d'Alba Valmaggiore opens to a pretty garnet color and feminine aromas of rose petal, licorice, forest berry and Indian spice. The wine saw 14 months of oak aging which is more than the average vintage. The tannins are well developed in 2013 and they leave a crunchy, firmly-etched impression on the close. The mouthfeel here is lean and streamlined.",,RP 93
2160,Bruno Giacosa,Barbera d'Alba,"The 2013 Barbera d'Alba isn't up to its usually high standards. Barbera loves warm, sunny conditions and 2013 delivered rain and cool temperatures instead. The 2011 and 2012 vintages showed kinder conditions to the grape. Luckily, this expression from Bruno Giacosa does not exhibit any green or herbal characteristics. It shows luscious cherry and dark berry nuances. The wine's acidity is in check for long aging potential. This wine may hold up to ten years. ",,RP 93
2161,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"Bruno Giacosa's 2012 Barbaresco Asili benefitted from a warm growing season. The wine opens to a dark, compact appearance and shows an impressive level of aromatic intensity and complexity. The tannins are slightly less mature and more astringent in 2012 compared to 2011. This bodes well for the aging potential of this beautiful wine. Fresh acidity caps a very pretty portrait of the Nebbiolo grape. This is a lovely offering from this historic producer. ",,RP 93
2162,Bruno Giacosa,Barbera d'Alba Falletto,"The 2012 Barbera d'Alba Falletto is a standout wine. With fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, this is a classic interpretation of the Barbera grape. The wine is hugely expressive and compelling with blackberry, spice, leather and balsam herb. This wine will not be produced in 2013 because Giacosa had to rip out a portion of the vineyard due to disease. Production will resume in 2014 (but bottle numbers will be cut in half to 6,000 plus 300 magnums). 
",,RP 93
2163,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"The 2011 Barolo Falletto is a beautifully balanced and determined wine. It spends 30 months in oak and this warm vintage is already showing a quick bottle evolution. This was an early vintage: Fruit was harvested on September 23, which is ten days before average. It shows soft, luscious lines and ripe fruit favors that are both generous and opulent. Yet, there is a healthy crunchiness and crackle in the mouth that makes for a long aging future ahead. Barolo Falletto closes with pretty aromas of dark fruit, spice and shaved truffle. 

",,RP 93
2164,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Santo Stefano,"This 2011 Barbaresco Albesani Vigna Santo Stefano is on the market since February and has had ample time to flesh out over the last six months of bottle aging. The wine opens to a light garnet color and immediate fruit tones that veer towards the jammy side with sun-dried strawberry and raspberry. It shows a good level of freshness and acidity to counter the warmer tendencies of the bouquet. The tannins deliver a smooth, silky quality and the wine starts to show pretty aromas of wet earth and black truffle after a few minutes in the glass. Drink: 2015-2030.  

It has been famously reported now that Bruno Giacosa did not make wine in 2010. If you ask his daughter Bruna why this legendary estate would skip such a promising vintage, her reply is simple: “Sometimes you need to follow your heart.” Like the 2006 vintage that was passed over because it marked the same year that Bruno suffered a massive stroke, the family has similarly private reasons for wanting to skip directly from 2009 to 2011. It’s a hole they chose to leave. In other news, the Giacosa family bought a tiny parcel in Rabaja (half an hectare) and plans to release 4,000 bottles of the inaugural vintage in 2013.

2165,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba Falletto,"From the Falletto property in Serralunga d'Abla, the 2012 Dolcetto d'Alba Falletto offers a beautiful vein of delicate mineral dryness that runs straight through the wine. Beyond that pretty accent are a long list of aromas including blackberry, ripe cherry, white almond and light shadings of exotic spice. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2019.

The wine sees two months more oak than the other Barbera d-Alba, and this slight change goes a long way in terms of adding extra texture and density. This wine demonstrates that 2011 was an excellent year for Barbera. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2022.

The vines are approximately 35 years old. There-s a touch of extra ripeness here, even a hint of strawberry, backed by rich berry fruit, cassis and blackberry. The wine shows its most elegant side in the mouth, where the firming, polished tannins give the wine backbone and grace. It-s deliciously silky and extra fine with microscopic precision.

2170,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"The 2009 Barolo Falletto is an exuberant and exciting wine with tight, firming tannins surrounded by deep layers of dried cherry, licorice, cassis, moist tobacco and campfire ash. What sets this Barolo apart is the focus and care it shows on the bouquet. It is as if each layer is a separately audible voice in a united chorus of flavors and aromas. Also notable is the balanced acidity that adds a bite of freshness without being too sharp. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2035.

Its 360-degree beauty shines comes through in terms of the intensity of the bouquet and the elegance of the mouthfeel. Again, super-finely textured tannins give the wine backbone and create a supporting structure for rich fruit flavors. There's just enough consistency here to fill the palate, yet the wine is never heavy or flat. It shows vibrant energy thanks to the natural freshness and that beautiful note of garden fresh red rose that pops up as nostalgic sign-off. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2040.

2172,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Santo Stefano,"The 2009 Barbaresco Santo Stefano is a big improvement over the 2008, although it still isn’t up to the level of the best wines that emerged from this historic cellar in Neive over the last four decades. Crushed flowers, tobacco, cloves and sweet dried cherries are all woven together nicely. Overall, the 2009 is a pretty Barbaresco with lovely mid-palate pliancy and fine overall harmony. The balance of fruit, acidity and tannin is solid. Stylistically, it is a fairly light to medium-bodied wine with much more near-term appeal than potential for aging. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2019.  

Bruno Giacosa fans will be thrilled to learn of the return of long-time winemaker Dante Scaglione to this historic property. Scaglione spent 16 years alongside Giacosa and is now back with the winery as a consultant, which bodes well for the future. The first vintage Scaglione oversaw in his new role is 2011. Until then, readers will have to accept the fact that the current releases aren’t up to Giacosa’s historical standards. Few, if any, Piemonte producers are more heavily represented in my cellar than Bruno Giacosa. I still own a few bottles of the mythical 1964 Barbaresco Santo Stefano Riserva, which remains one of the greatest wines I have ever tasted. Count me among those who hope this iconic winery can quickly return to the level of their glory days.

This is a decidedly understated vintage for the Barolo Falletto. The wine’s mid-weight structure suggests it will be at its finest over the next handful of years. Overall the 2008 Falletto is diluted and fleeting. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2018.  

It’s hard to know what to make of Bruno Giacosa’s 2008 Baroli. Over the years I have had the privilege and pleasure to drink virtually all of Giacosa’s wines from both legendary and weaker vintages all the way back to 1961. These wines don’t match anything in my previous experience.

I still remember tasting this wine the very first time. It is every bit as dazzling today. Dark fruit, menthol, spices, licorice, graphite and tar meld together in this towering, statuesque Barbaresco. Readers who own the Rabaja are in for a thrilling ride. It is easily one of the best wines Bruno Giacosa has ever made. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2031. 

This is a fabulous set of wines from one of the great Giacosa vintages. Admittedly, opening ten year-old Giacosa Barbareschi and Baroli must be viewed as a purely academic excercise, as the wines are nowhere near ready.

2180,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba Sorano,"The 2010 Dolcetto d’Alba Sorano, from purchased fruit, is easily the most successful of Giacosa’s 2010 Dolcetti. Blueberries, licorice, tar and crushed rocks are some of the nuances that come together in this varietally expressive, true to type Dolcetto. Hints of violets and licorice linger on the close. Treiso has long been considered a superior village for Dolcetto, and this bottling shows why. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2015. 

I suppose it was bound to happen. Few wineries have been through as much stress in the last few years as Giacosa, and the wines have finally begun to show some cracks.

I suppose it was bound to happen. Few wineries have been through as much stress in the last few years as Giacosa, and the wines have finally begun to show some cracks. Although he is doing better today, Bruno Giacosa’s health issues and subsequent recovery put a big strain on the winery. The departure of long-time oenologist Dante Scaglione in 2008 was another blow. Scaglione has since returned to the winery as a consultant, which is an encouraging development. Quite simply, the 2008 Barbareschi are the weakest wines I have ever tasted from Bruno Giacosa. The fact that some of Giacosa’s recent releases from his negociant operation are stronger than the wines made from estate fruit suggests some of the issues may be in the vineyards. Regardless, there is no other way to view these wines than as major disappointments. In November I will host my annual White Truffle Charity Dinner to benefit The Mt. Sinai Hospital. On that night I will open my last remaining bottles of Giacosa’s 1964 Barbaresco Riserva Santo Stefano and 1967 Barbaresco Riserva Asili (among other rarities) and raise a toast to the towering genius of Neive, with the sincerest wish that these new releases, and the 2008 Barbareschi in particular, represent what will ultimately be viewed as a small blemish on an otherwise extraordinary career.

2189,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"The 2000 Barbaresco Riserva Asili is as it always has been; impeccably refined, nuanced and silky from start to finish. I have tasted (or drunk!) this wine at least a dozen times since it was first released. The bouquet shows the faintest signs of positive development while the fruit remains vibrant and beautifully articulated. I don’t see the 2000 Asili Riserva being one of the longest lived Red Labels, but it is unquestionably striking in its beauty. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2020.  

Bruno Giacosa has long been a fan of the 2000 vintage. I found his 2000s quite forward when I tasted them at the winery in November 2010, but far fresher when I opened the same bottles from my cellar in the US.",,RP 95
2190,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2000 Barolo Riserva Le Rocche del Falletto is like silk on the palate. Sweet, ripe tannins frame an exquisite core of fruit. The 2000 is remarkably elegant, sensual and polished but it doesn’t quite provide the visceral thrill of the most monumental vintages. Still, this is a very strong showing from a wine that has frankly never moved me emotionally. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2020.

2191,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"The 2000 Barbaresco Rabaja is marvelous. It is also the most backward of Giacosa’s 2000s. Intense notes of minerals, menthol, plums and spicecake take shape in the glass as this regal, aristocratic Barbaresco reveals its pedigree and sheer class. Here the warmth of the vintage offsets the natural austerity and power of Rabaja, resulting in a complete, beautifully balanced Barbaresco of the highest level. The Red Labels get most of the attention among Giacosa’s 2000s, but the Rabaja isn’t too far off the pace. This will be a spectacular wine to follow over the next 10-15 years. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2025.

2192,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Santo Stefano,"The 2000 Barbaresco Santo Stefano shows gorgeous site and vintage character in its sweet, perfumed fruit, spicecakr and crushed flowers. Santo Stefano is a warm, south-facing site, and much of that is captured in the wine’s open, inviting personality. I don’t expect this to be a super-long lived Santo Stefano, but it has held up quite well and far better thn the 1997, also from a hot year. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2020.

2193,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2007 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche bursts onto the palate with masses of dark fruit. The Riserva is a decidedly dark, brooding wine in this vintage. Scorched earth, smoke, menthol, licorice and new leather flow with marvelous intensity all the way through to the powerful finish. Over time the classic Giacosa bouquet of dried rose petal emerges, rounding out this fabulous effort in grand style. The imposing tannins will require a measure of patience, but the 2007 Riserva is shaping up to be another magnificent, towering Barolo from Bruno Giacosa. Anticipated maturity: 2022-2042. 

My annual tasting with Bruno Giacosa encompassed all his 2008s and 2009s, plus the 2000 Baroli and Barbareschi, which will be covered in a subsequent article. Vintage 2008 and 2009 are both interesting, but don’t look to be as consistent across the board as 2007. Never one to say much, Giacosa is quite reserved and even severe with his own wines, with the exception of the occasional wine that crosses his lips and elicits a ‘this is good.’

2194,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"The 2007 Barbaresco Riserva Asili is sweet, perfumed and totally gorgeous in its round, sensual fruit. Silky, elegant tannins frame the long, harmonious finish. Stylistically the 2007 is most similar to the 2004, although it seems to have more exuberant, opulent fruit. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2037.

2195,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"The 2007 Barolo Falletto is an overachieving wine, even at this high level. The bouquet has a level of delineation, sweetness, inner perfume and nuance generally only found in Giacosa’s Red Label Riservas. The Falletto impresses for the intensity of its dark fruit and superb overall balance. The extroverted personality of the vintage is quite evident, especially as the wine sits in the glass. Menthol, flowers and licorice add the final notes of complexity on the finish. This is an especially racy Barolo from Bruno Giacosa, but the trademark elegance is there. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.

These entry-level releases from Bruno Giacosa are well-made but frankly offer little to get truly excited about. Perhaps it is the preponderance of 2008s in this lineup, but I would like to think Giacosa could coax a little more magic from his smaller wines. On a more positive note, a recent comprehensive tasting of Giacosa’s Baroli and Barbareschi found the wines in great shape. I will report on that tasting on www.erobertparker.com For now, let me just say that the 2004s are living up to my lofty expectations. The 2003s are surprisingly fresh, while the 2005s show remarkable balance and classiness. Giacosa’s 2007 Barbareschi were reviewed in Issue 185.

2197,Bruno Giacosa,Arneis,"The 2009 Roero Arneis is a winner. An expressive, floral bouquet melds into succulent peaches and apricots as this elegant, refined white opens up in the glass. Slightly bitter (but not unpleasant) notes typical of this indigenous grape linger on the finish. Giacosa’s Arneis is no longer the great value it once was, but there is little doubt it continues to deliver the goods. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2011.

2204,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto,"I remember paying what at the time seemed like a small fortune for bottles of Giacosa’s 1990 Barolo Riserva Falletto at Peck’s Enoteca in Milan. What I would give today to be able to buy more at the same tariff! The 1990 Barolo Riserva Falletto is one of Bruno Giacosa’s most towering wines. Period. Rich, layered and opulent, this mineral-driven, powerful Barolo covers every inch of the palate with masses of dark fruit, smoke, soy, plums, menthol, dried roses, pine and a host of other balsamic overtones. This vivid, kaleidoscopic Barolo is a reference-point wine readers won’t want to miss. As always, the Riserva Falletto is virile and authoritative in tone. Simply put, it its profound. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.  

Bruno Giacosa’s wines are well represented in my personal cellar, which was the source for the vast majority of these bottles. I have had the good fortune to taste all of Giacosa’s 1989s and 1990s from multiple sources over the last year, and therefore can report that these notes are representative of what readers can expect from well-stored bottles. I consider 1989 and 1990 – along with 1978, 1982, 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2007 – to be among Giacosa’s finest vintages. The bevy of Red Label Riservas in this article says it all. In 1989 and 1990 Giacosa produced an immense number of legendary wines. In fact, he is one of the very few producers who did exceptionally well in both years. In general the 1989s are a touch more layered and nuanced, while the 1990s are impressive for their massive concentration. If forced to state a preference, I would say 1990 gets the nod for its consistency from top to bottom, even if few of those wines reach the sublime heights of the very finest 1989s. Still, these are relatively small distinctions at this high level. Readers who have the opportunity to taste any of these wines should not think twice.  By the late 1980s Giacosa had begun to move towards an enlightened traditional style with the introduction of the French oak casks he now uses exclusively. Fermentations and barrel aging, however, remained very much within the framework of traditional winemaking, resulting in a combination that was electric. Readers will note that many of Giacosa’s Red Label Riservas during this time were made in small lots (such as the 1990 Asili and 1989 Collina Rionda), and that for practical purposes those wines were aged in medium-size casks rather than large casks.",,RP 95
2205,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva,"The 1990 Barbaresco Riserva is unique in that it is the only non single-vineyard Red Label Riserva Giacosa has ever made, with the possible exception of the 1961 Barbaresco Riserva (which pre-dates the use of the Red Label). Masses of dark fruit, spices and minerals emerge from this large-scaled, dramatic Barbaresco. The wine remains impressively young, but the balance here is stunning. Readers who own this rare bottling should be thrilled. According to Bruno Giacosa the 1990 Barbaresco Riserva is a blend of the Santo Stefano and Gallina vineyards, both in Neive. The wine certainly shows the power and exuberance of the village, at times reminding me of Barbarescos from Starderi in its expansive, dense personality. This is wonderful juice.

Although today Giacosa is often associated with this grand cru vineyard, the 1990 was only his second wine from the site, and he produced a mere 2,000 bottles. The Musigny-like nose alone is extraordinary. Red berries, roses, flowers, sweet spices and minerals emerge from a delicate, nuanced frame. Textural finesse, subtlety and a cashmere-like elegance define this delicious Barbaresco. Although it will probably continue to age gracefully for years, this is a Giacosa Red Label that I wouldn’t hang on to for decades, as the fruit is showing the early signs of fading. It would be a pity to miss this sublime Barbaresco in its peak drinking window. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2020.

I consider 1989 and 1990 – along with 1978, 1982, 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2007 – to be among Giacosa’s finest vintages. The bevy of Red Label Riservas in this article says it all. In 1989 and 1990 Giacosa produced an immense number of legendary wines. In fact, he is one of the very few producers who did exceptionally well in both years. In general the 1989s are a touch more layered and nuanced, while the 1990s are impressive for their massive concentration. If forced to state a preference, I would say 1990 gets the nod for its consistency from top to bottom, even if few of those wines reach the sublime heights of the very finest 1989s. Still, these are relatively small distinctions at this high level. Readers who have the opportunity to taste any of these wines should not think twice.  By the late 1980s Giacosa had begun to move towards an enlightened traditional style with the introduction of the French oak casks he now uses exclusively. Fermentations and barrel aging, however, remained very much within the framework of traditional winemaking, resulting in a combination that was electric. Readers will note that many of Giacosa’s Red Label Riservas during this time were made in small lots (such as the 1990 Asili and 1989 Collina Rionda), and that for practical purposes those wines were aged in medium-size casks rather than large casks.",,RP 95
2209,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Gallina,"The 1990 Barbareso Gallina is simply awesome. The wine boasts a seamless core of rich red fruits in a soft, generous style. This opulent Barbaresco possesses impeccable balance and tons of class. Floral notes intermingled with bright red fruits provide lift on the finish, adding lovely balance to the dense fruit. This is the most approachable of Giacosa’s 1990s but has plenty of stuffing to last another twenty years. The 1978 is still going strong. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

2210,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Collina Rionda,"The 1990 Barolo Riserva Collina Rionda is a wine that frankly I never found fully satisfying. The fruit shows slight elements of over-ripeness and pruniness, while the volatile acidity is at the extreme limit of what most tasters, me included, are likely to find acceptable. Still, it is impossible to ignore the wine’s sheer density, richness and volume. Readers who can look past these imperfections will find much to admire here – and indeed most any producer would be thrilled to have made a wine like this – but by Bruno Giacosa standards, the 1990 Collina Rionda falls a touch short of immortality.

2211,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Collina Rionda,"I suspect over the years I have had more than my fair share of the 1989 Barolo Riserva Collina Rionda. After all, there were only 2,838 bottles produced. Still, I never fail to be utterly seduced by this transcendental, emotionally moving Barolo. The Rionda isn’t Giacosa’s most powerful wine, rather it is a Barolo built on elegance. Impossibly fine, silky tannins frame subtle, yet incredibly vivid aromatics that meld into a gorgeous core of violets, roses, tar, licorice and minerals. Still incredibly fresh, this towering Barolo has another 20+ years of life ahead. It remains Giacosa’s foremost masterpiece and one of the greatest wines ever made. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.

Endowed with never-ending layers of perfumed fruit, the wine reveals mind-bending complexity and a profound personality that words will never do justice to. This remains one of Giacosa’s all-time monumental wines, and it simply must be experienced by anyone who seeks to understand the genius of Bruno Giacosa. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.

Massive and virile, it is an assertive Barolo that commands attention for its explosive fruit and multi-faceted personality. The tannins are imposing, but also beautifully balanced. This is Giacosa’s most explosive, rich wine in 1989, and it is utterly divine. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2030.

Deceptively medium in body, the wine blossoms in the glass, showing gorgeous richness and density backed up by powerful, sinewy tannins. The Villero doesn’t quite have the power of the Red Label Riservas, but it comes awfully close. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

Bruno Giacosa created quite a stir when he announced this spring that he would not bottle any of his 2006 Barolos and Barbarescos. While I wasn’t surprised he would pass on bottling a few wines – as early as spring 2007 Giacosa did not present the 2006 Barbaresco Santo Stefano and Barolo Croera in my annual barrel tastings – the decision to skip an entire vintage prompted a back and forth volley of polemics that is such an integral part of the Italian way of life. Clearly Giacosa had a difficult emotional relationship with these wines from the start, as they were made in the year he suffered a stroke and was absent from the winery for long periods of time. Perhaps Giacosa simply wanted to cancel the entire year from his memory. Or maybe it is a case where the vintage quality in Giacosa’s vineyards and later of the wines themselves in the cellar did not live up to his exacting standards. Given the emotional weight attached to this year I am not sure anyone – even Giacosa himself – will fully understand all of the circumstances behind the decision not to bottle the wines. After having tasted Giacosa’s 2006 Barolos and Barbarescos on numerous occasions I am convinced he has bottled lesser wines in the past. It is important to remember that virtually all of Piedmont’s top estates are essentially small, family-run wineries, and in that regard Giacosa is no exception. What seems pretty obvious at this point is that under normal circumstances without emotional duress, Giacosa and his team would have been better equipped to deal with the challenges of the harvest. Giacosa’s decision is more a reflection of the estate’s inability to deal with a difficult harvest (for understandable reasons) rather than a commentary on the intrinsic quality of the vintage itself. Giacosa may also have been prompted to skip an average year for his wines based on the exceptional juice he put into the bottle in the surrounding 2004, 2005 and 2007 vintages. Sadly, prices for the top bottles – the Red Label Barolo and Barbaresco Riservas in particular – continue to climb as collectors throughout the world recognize the quality of the wines. Still, at the risk of sounding out of touch with today’s economic environment, it is pretty clear that Giacosa’s finest wines remain relatively well-priced within the context of the world finest and most collectible wines. A recent bottle of the 1989 Barbaresco Riserva Santo Stefano stood shoulder to shoulder with the 1989 Haut-Brion and Rousseau’s 1990 Chambertin....in fact, it may have even surpassed those icons!

In this vintage the Falletto is rather high toned and aromatically expressive but the darker, baritone notes this vineyard is capable of are missing. Still, this is a very pretty if somewhat atypical wine to enjoy over the next few years. The Falletto is a touch more stern and tannic than the Sorano, so it is best enjoyed at the dinner table.

Sweet roses, minerals, flowers, menthol and minerals emerge from this firm yet intensely perfumed Barbaresco. The wine reveals gorgeous weight and textural richness in a firm style that requires patience. Beginning with the 2007 vintage, the vineyards delimitations in Barbaresco have been re-drawn. As a result, Giacosa’s parcel in Rabaja is now considered part of Asili, which means there will be no more Barbaresco Rabaja from Bruno Giacosa after 2005. In 2007, the white label Asili is roughly 80% juice from the old ‘Rabaja’ parcel and 20% Asili from the vines Giacosa has always used for his Asili. Curiously, the 2007 Asili is a very soft wine, considering it is made mostly from vines that informed such majestic Rabajas as the 2001 and 2004. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.

Or maybe it is a case where the vintage quality in Giacosa’s vineyards and later of the wines themselves in the cellar did not live up to his exacting standards. Given the emotional weight attached to this year I am not sure anyone – even Giacosa himself – will fully understand all of the circumstances behind the decision not to bottle the wines. After having tasted Giacosa’s 2006 Barolos and Barbarescos on numerous occasions I am convinced he has bottled lesser wines in the past. It is important to remember that virtually all of Piedmont’s top estates are essentially small, family-run wineries, and in that regard Giacosa is no exception. What seems pretty obvious at this point is that under normal circumstances without emotional duress, Giacosa and his team would have been better equipped to deal with the challenges of the harvest. Giacosa’s decision is more a reflection of the estate’s inability to deal with a difficult harvest (for understandable reasons) rather than a commentary on the intrinsic quality of the vintage itself. Giacosa may also have been prompted to skip an average year for his wines based on the exceptional juice he put into the bottle in the surrounding 2004, 2005 and 2007 vintages. Sadly, prices for the top bottles – the Red Label Barolo and Barbaresco Riservas in particular – continue to climb as collectors throughout the world recognize the quality of the wines. Still, at the risk of sounding out of touch with today’s economic environment, it is pretty clear that Giacosa’s finest wines remain relatively well-priced within the context of the world finest and most collectible wines. A recent bottle of the 1989 Barbaresco Riserva Santo Stefano stood shoulder to shoulder with the 1989 Haut-Brion and Rousseau’s 1990 Chambertin....in fact, it may have even surpassed those icons!

2225,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2004 Barolo Riserva Falletto Vigna Le Rocche is off the charts. Sweet roses, menthol, tar, licorice and minerals come together in a sensual, elegant style that recalls Giacosa’s legendary 1989 Riserva Collina Rionda, a wine many observers (this one included) place at the top of the hierarchy of all-time legendary Barolos. Ripe, sensual, and utterly spellbinding, the 2004 Riserva Le Rocche del Falletto offers superb elegance and pedigree. At this stage the wine remains surprisingly accessible. Readers will want to taste the 2004 Rocche as soon as possible as it will almost certainly head for a long period of dormancy in the near future. This magical Barolo will likely merit a perfect score in the future. The 2004 Rocche is the last wine Giacosa and former longtime oenologist Dante Scaglione produced together from start to finish and it is an appropriate bookend to a wonderful partnership that yielded so many profound wines. Anticipated maturity: 2024-2044.

2226,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2005 Barolo Falleto Vigna Le Rocche is a massive, towering Barolo loaded with tons of rich, primary fruit. The wine remains powerful, dense and muscular with superb length even if it is a smaller-scaled Barolo compared to previous great vintages. That said, when I came back to the wine after it had been in the glass for an hour or so, I found that the wine had grown remarkably. While the 2005 doesn’t have the explosive personality of the 2004, it remains an awesome achievement in this vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2035. 

Bruno Giacosa seems to be in better shape each time I see him, but on my latest visit, in November 2008, he seemed particularly energized. We spent several hours tasting through the 2006s and 2007s from barrel, along with all of the 2005s and 2004s from bottle. As www.erobertparker.com readers know, I have been following Giacosa’s 2005 Barolos for several years and I have been fond of these wines for some time, as they have always demonstrated exceptional balance. Now that the wines are in bottle they are every bit as delicious as they were from barrel. Giacosa fans will want to give these 2005 Barolos (and the Barbarescos, too) careful consideration as 2006 is shaping up to be a weaker vintage here. On the subject of the 2005 Barbarescos, they are every bit as successful as my scores suggest, if anything I may have misjudged just how great the wines will ultimately be. As for the 2005 Barolos, the wines seem to have been helped quite a bit by the southern exposure of the Falletto vineyard.

2228,Bruno Giacosa,Arneis,"Bruno Giacosa’s Arneis is a knockout in 2007. This beautiful white reveals gorgeous inner sweetness in its ripe apricots, peaches and flowers. Although the wine did not undergo malolactic fermentation, it comes across as lush and full-bodied, with suggestions of botrytis that linger on the finish. The 2007 Arneis was the last wine bottled at Giacosa by oenologist Dante Scaglione who left the estate in March 2008. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2009.  

My May visit with Bruno Giacosa was significant in many ways. It was the first time in many years that the recently departed, long-time oenologist wasn’t on hand to lead the tasting. At the same time, Giacosa appeared to be in higher spirits than I have witnessed in previous recent visits. Oftentimes change can be invigorating, and I certainly hope that will be the case here. New oenologist Giorgio Lavagna has his work cut out for him, but I can only wish him the very best. As for the wines, we spent several hours surveying all the 2005s, 2006s and 2007s from cask, after which we re-visited several of the 2004s from bottle. The 2004s confirmed their stature as masterpieces, yet Giacosa fans will delight at the prospect of a number of potentially outstanding wines in the pipeline. The 2005 Barbarescos have always shown tons of harmony and elegance from cask, so I was happy to find the wines just as outstanding from bottle. Although there are no Red Label Riservas from Giacosa in 2005, the wines display remarkable quality across the board. The rest of the line-up is solid as well.

Although there are no Red Label Riservas from Giacosa in 2005, the wines display remarkable quality across the board. The rest of the line-up is solid as well.

2235,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Santo Stefano,"The 2005 Barbaresco Santo Stefano is striking in its beauty. This firm, structured wine bursts from the glass with layers of dark red fruit, spices, flowers and menthol. Medium in body, the wine possesses notable inner beauty in a transparent, almost weightless style. There is superb pedigree here, not to mention tons of class. Once again the Santo Stefano bottling delivers the goods. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2025. 

My May visit with Bruno Giacosa was significant in many ways. It was the first time in many years that the recently departed, long-time oenologist wasn’t on hand to lead the tasting. At the same time, Giacosa appeared to be in higher spirits than I have witnessed in previous recent visits. Oftentimes change can be invigorating, and I certainly hope that will be the case here. New oenologist Giorgio Lavagna has his work cut out for him, but I can only wish him the very best. As for the wines, we spent several hours surveying all the 2005s, 2006s and 2007s from cask, after which we re-visited several of the 2004s from bottle.

2236,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"Giacosa’s 2005 Barbaresco Asili is noticeably rounder, sweeter and denser than the Santo Stefano. It shows remarkable balance and harmony in an incredibly pure, graceful style. The tannins are so finessed and elegant it is hard to actually perceive them on the palate. Here too, the wine shows awesome inner balance and poise. Sweet raspberries, flowers, roses and spices are just some of the nuances that emerge from this incredibly delicious, promising Barbaresco. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2025.

2237,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Rabajà,"The 2005 Barbaresco Rabaja is the densest and richest of these 2005 Barbarescos. Because it is aged in a slightly smaller cask, the wine shows an explosive personality along with some oak nuances that require bottle age to settle down. This muscular Barbaresco resonates on the palate with layers of spiced, mentholated dark cherries, minerals and licorice. It remains a dense, structured and primary wine in need of serious bottle age for the firm tannins to melt away. This, too, is a sublime wine from Bruno Giacosa. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2025.

2238,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba Falletto,"The estate’s 2006 Dolcetto d’Alba Falletto is made from the same vineyard in Serralunga that is the source of Giacosa’s Barolos. It is a rich Dolcetto jam-packed with vibrant, shimmering fruit supported by notable structure. With air, licorice and menthol nuances emerge adding further complexity. This is one of the very rare cases with Dolcetto where I am tempted to say that a few additional months of aging will help the wine come together even more. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2011.

My most recent visit with Bruno Giacosa in May 2008 was illuminating, as we spent the afternoon tasting through all of his 2005s, 2006s, and 2007s. It was also my first visit to the estate since the departure of long-time oenologist Dante Scaglione. Change can be difficult, but it can also be energizing, and I hope that will be the case here. I will have more to say about Giacosa and his new releases in Issue 179. Unfortunately, price increases and a weakening US dollar have pushed many of the wines above the $25 range, but readers should still be able to find these two Dolcettos from the 2006 vintage.

2239,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto d'Alba,"Giacosa’s 2006 Dolcetto d’Alba is a lovely effort redolent of crushed flowers, raspberries and minerals. Made in a simple, easy going style, it nevertheless offers plenty of detail with excellent length and a clean finish. This textbook Dolcetto is a terrific everyday wine. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2009.

2240,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto,"Giacosa’s 2004 Barolo Falletto is so compelling it will be hard not to drink it in its youth. This gorgeous Barolo reveals a deeply structured frame layered with sweet dark fruit, mint, spice and pine. At once delicate and powerful, it is a beautifully finessed wine that is sure to provide much pleasure. A recent bottle of the 1982 is a testament to the virtues of this great site as interpreted by Bruno Giacosa. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2024. 

Bruno Giacosa’s profound 2004s, which I first wrote about in Issue 173, continue with these superb Barolos, all of which merit close attention. I also had a chance to re-taste the 2004 Barbarescos and they were as impressive as they have been on previous occasions.

2241,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Vigna Croera,"The 2004 Barolo Vigna Croera reveals pretty aromatics and notes of smoke, tar, roses, herbs and the small red fruits that are characteristic of the wines of La Morra. Made in a medium-bodied, delicate style it possesses a graceful, feminine personality and finessed tannins. Even though the wine continued to gain weight in the glass I noted that it was less expressive than when I tasted it from barrel in April 2007. The Croera is made from a high altitude plot in the Serradenari district of La Morra. This site has never been particularly well regarded for Nebbiolo. Long-time oenologist Dante Scaglione told me he expects the vines to only yield top-flight Barolo in truly great vintages. There will be no 2005 or 2006. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2020.

2242,Bruno Giacosa,Arneis,"This set of new releases opens with the 2006 Arneis. It reveals expressive, soaring aromatics along with green apples, apricots, peaches and jasmine that flow from the glass with notable purity and personality. Made in a super-racy, sexy style, the 2006 is a great vintage for this wine. It is best enjoyed over the next year or so. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2008. 

At a time in life when many of his colleagues have begun to slow down, Bruno Giacosa continues to make stunning wines of the highest level. Of course Giacosa has the good fortune of having the services of long-time oenologist Dante Scaglione, who is one of the most prodigiously talented winemakers in Italy. Although age has slowed Giacosa down somewhat, he was in fine form during the several hours we spent tasting his 2004, 2005 and 2006 Barolos and Barbarescos from barrel earlier this year. Simply put, 2004 will go down as one of the all-time great Giacosa vintages for both Barolo and Barbaresco. The Red Label Riservas are the Barbaresco Asili and the Barolo Le Rocche del Falletto, but his other wines aren't too far behind in terms of quality. From cask, the Barolos revealed slightly more promise, but that may be splitting hairs at this level. In 2004 Giacosa also fulfilled a long-standing dream by making his first Barolo from La Morra, the Barolo Croera, which will be released next year. The Croera is made from a newly-acquired vineyard in the Serradenari district of La Morra, an area best known for its Dolcettos. So far Giacosa's 2005s appear to be well-balanced, yet smaller-scaled wines that will likely drink well relatively early, while the 2006s are decidedly bigger and more powerful. I also noted a marked improvement in the quality of the Barbaresco Santo Stefano, which is the only single-vineyard wine the estate still makes from purchased fruit. Our tasting ended with the 1967 Barbaresco Riserva Asili. It was, in a word...sublime. The world will have to wait for the 2004 Barolos and Barbarescos to be released, in the meantime readers will find no shortage of compelling offerings among this set of new releases from Bruno Giacosa. The 2006 Dolcettos are excellent to outstanding, while the 2005 Barberas reflect the more modest qualities of that vintage. Giacosa is among the producers whose views on the 2003 vintage for Barolo and Barbaresco have changed dramatically in recent years. While many producers draw comparisons with 1947, Giacosa is one of the very few who can speak from personal experience. At first pessimistic, he initially thought he might not bottle any of his top wines but as time has passed his stance has changed, and today he is much more enthusiastic about the vintage.

2243,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto Basarin,"The 2006 Dolcetto d’Alba Basarin is a delicious wine. It is softer and rounder than the normal bottling with notable intensity in its fruit and a richly powerful, expressive personality. This expansive, generous Dolcetto is sure to find many admirers. Basarin has always been highly-regarded among old-timers in Barbaresco as a superb site for Dolcetto. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2009.

2247,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"The 2004 Barbaresco Riserva Asili is even more compelling than the Rabaja. It floats on the palate with an ethereal core of sweet fruit that calls to mind a profound Musigny, but with the unmistakable structure of Nebbiolo. The perfumed purity of the fruit carries all the way through to the deeply satisfying, resonating finish. Made in a soft, seductive style, this remarkable wine is decidedly more approachable and easy to appreciate today than the Rabaja. Giacosa fans will have a great time discussing the merits of the Rabaja and the Asili in 2004, but to me they are virtually equally moving; Asili for its feminine gracefulness and Rabaja for its size and power. The Asili should prove more accessible at an earlier age. Bruno Giacosa says his 2004 Asili Riserva will turn out to be just like his 2000 Asili Riserva, the wine he still thinks is the best he’s ever made. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2025.

It boasts phenomenal richness and complexity in its dark, brooding aromatics and powerful structure, with suggestions of roses, tar, menthol, coffee beans and baking spices that emerge from the glass in an endless display of elegance married to sheer force. Although the Rabaja will be released as a white label non-Riserva, it is very close to Riserva-level quality. From barrel it revealed just a little less length than the Asili, It will be interesting to see how the Asili and Rabaja develop in bottle. I would not be surprised to see the Rabaja merit a higher score in another year or two. This magnificent wine will especially appeal to readers who enjoy a structured style of Barbaresco.

At first pessimistic, he initially thought he might not bottle any of his top wines but as time has passed his stance has changed, and today he is much more enthusiastic about the vintage.

2249,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Santo Stefano,"Giacosa's 2004 Barbaresco Santo Stefano is a superb wine. Sweet, floral, mentholated aromatics meld into an expressive core of ripe fruit, with superb length and elegant tannins to round out the finish. Made in a more linear style than the Asili and Rabaja, it doesn't possess the expansiveness of those two wines, but it does reveal tremendous depth, harmony and balance. This pure, sweet, long Barbaresco is the best Santo Stefano in years. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2022. 

At a time in life when many of his colleagues have begun to slow down, Bruno Giacosa continues to make stunning wines of the highest level. Of course Giacosa has the good fortune of having the services of long-time oenologist Dante Scaglione, who is one of the most prodigiously talented winemakers in Italy. Although age has slowed Giacosa down somewhat, he was in fine form during the several hours we spent tasting his 2004, 2005 and 2006 Barolos and Barbarescos from barrel earlier this year. Simply put, 2004 will go down as one of the all-time great Giacosa vintages for both Barolo and Barbaresco. The Red Label Riservas are the Barbaresco Asili and the Barolo Le Rocche del Falletto, but his other wines aren't too far behind in terms of quality. From cask, the Barolos revealed slightly more promise, but that may be splitting hairs at this level. In 2004 Giacosa also fulfilled a long-standing dream by making his first Barolo from La Morra, the Barolo Croera, which will be released next year. The Croera is made from a newly-acquired vineyard in the Serradenari district of La Morra, an area best known for its Dolcettos. So far Giacosa's 2005s appear to be well-balanced, yet smaller-scaled wines that will likely drink well relatively early, while the 2006s are decidedly bigger and more powerful. I also noted a marked improvement in the quality of the Barbaresco Santo Stefano, which is the only single-vineyard wine the estate still makes from purchased fruit. Our tasting ended with the 1967 Barbaresco Riserva Asili. It was, in a word...sublime. The world will have to wait for the 2004 Barolos and Barbarescos to be released, in the meantime readers will find no shortage of compelling offerings among this set of new releases from Bruno Giacosa. The 2006 Dolcettos are excellent to outstanding, while the 2005 Barberas reflect the more modest qualities of that vintage.

2250,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2003 Barolo Falleto Vigna Le Rocche is a fascinating wine. It is classic Giacosa, with a lovely core of sweet roses, raspberries, licorice and menthol that is currently hiding under an imposing wall of tannins. It is also a wine of contrasts, at times open and accessible, at others brooding and shut down. As it sits in the glass the fruit gradually emerges to fill out the wine’s structure. It had only improved when I re-tasted it several days after first opening the bottle. That said, it will require further cellaring to soften the tannins, as the wine has shut down considerably since bottling. Made from the heart of the Falletto vineyard, it clearly benefits from the age of the vines in these selected plots. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2023.

2252,Bruno Giacosa,Barbaresco Asili,"The just-bottled 2003 Barbaresco Asili is the only Barbaresco the ultra-perfectionist Bruno Giacosa has decided to release in this difficult vintage and it shows why Giacosa, along with Angelo Gaja, is in a class of his own when it comes to Barbaresco. Medium-red in color, it offers an expressive nose along with delicate nuances of super-ripe red fruits, macerated cherries and alcohol. Made in an atypically lush style, yet balanced by a classic sense of structure and proportion, this medium to full-bodied Barbaresco is one of the highlights of the vintage.

Despite its ripeness, the wine appears to have plenty of structure underneath and carries its 15% alcohol with grace. Even better in the bottle than it was from barrel, this exceptional wine is not to be missed. In addition to 6,773 750ml bottles there are also 1,000 magnums of this juice which Giacosa feels has enough structure to age well. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2010.

2255,Bruno Giacosa,Arneis,"This offering is slightly above the $20 price required to be considered a “best buy,” but it is such a superb example of Arneis, I had to include it. While the great man, Bruno Giacosa, is renowned for his majestic Barolos and Barbarescos, he also produces excellent Arneis. 2005 is a top vintage for this varietal, producing unusually powerful and rich wines. Giacosa’s 2005 was fermented in stainless steel with its malolactic blocked. It possesses remarkable intensity and richness as well as superb purity, wonderful freshness, a gorgeous, persistent texture, and flowery, honeysuckle, white peach, pear, and apple liqueur-like aromas and flavors. One of the most glorious dry whites made in Italy, it should be consumed over the next year.

2256,Bruno Giacosa,Arneis,"For my taste, the brilliant Bruno Giacosa fashions the finest Arneis in Piedmont. This indigenous varietal hits remarkable heights under Giacosa’s guidance, revealing subtle but authoritative notes of white peaches, honeysuckle, and pear in a crisp, medium-bodied, fruity, stylish format. With good definition as well as loads of character, this is my favorite dry white of Piedmont. However, it requires consumption over the next 12-24 months.",,RP 95
2257,Bruno Giacosa,Dolcetto Basarin,"This year’s lineup of wines features, as always, the usual authoritative efforts with Nebbiolo. But other wines of real interest are also present, as for example the 2003 Dolcetto Basarin from a vineyard in Neive. Bursting with cherry fruit, floral scents, and notes of almonds, solid and sustained, it will drink well for several years to come, but why wait when the immediate pleasure is so enticing?

Superbly rich with a potent nose of plums, dried roses, leather, resin, and spice, it is equally impressive in flavor, intense, warm, and concentrated, the packed texture and virile tannins perfectly balanced by the roundness of the texture and the polish of the finish. I would consider this a must purchase for anyone seriously interested in investigating the best in Nebbiolo from Barbaresco. Drink: 2005-2020.

2259,Bruno Giacosa,Barolo Falletto Vigna Le Rocche,"The 2000 Barolo Falleto Vigna Le Rocche is from the best vineyards of Giacosa’s own Serralunga d’Alba estate, is a horse of a different color. Equally intense, it is considerably fuller and rounder, fleshier on the mid-palate and finish than the Falletto, and decisively more complex in aroma with all the familiar notes of tar and roses, anisette and wild cherry fruit. Any comparisons with the 1999 version of this wine, however, richer, more nuanced and more velvety, a Barolo which seems better every time it is tasted, are completely out of place. And to mention this wine in the same breath with the 1996 Barolo Falletto Riserva is a joke. Drink: 2006-2020.

Authoritative and with plenty of grip, it will undoubtedly improve over the next 15 years of useful life it will doubtlessly enjoy.

The earthy nose offers aromas of black fruits, underbrush, white truffles, tobacco, smoke, and sweet black cherry and plum-like fruit. Thick, tannic, muscular, and superbly concentrated, this mammoth wine requires another 5-10 years of cellaring. It should open by 2008-2010, and last for the following 20-30 years.

There are loads of glycerin, moderately high tannin, and an amazingly long finish of nearly 50 seconds. As staggering as it is now, I am sure it will close down and require 7-8 years of cellaring.

Aromas of new saddle leather, fennel, smoke, tobacco, kirsch liqueur, and licorice soar from the glass of this ripe, opulent, medium to full-bodied Barbaresco. I hesitate to say it can be drunk young given the tendency of these wines to shut down, but readers who purchase it (that includes me) should let it settle down for a year or two after arrival, and drink it over the following 15+ years.

Classic aromas of rose petals, melted tar, and cherry liqueur not only soar aromatically, but saturate the palate and coat the taster's teeth. Profoundly complex and multilayered, with an exquisite texture and overall harmony, for a Giacosa Barolo it is uncommonly precocious, making me think it will provide profound drinking in 2-3 years, and last for three decades.

In the mouth, the wine is stunningly concentrated, extremely full-bodied, with high tannin, and fabulously pure, sweet, cherry cough syrup-like, licorice, smoke, and dried herb flavors. The finish lasts for over 45 seconds although this 1996 is still young and tight. It should enjoy a glorious evolution. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2030.

I recently had several bottles at an excellent new Seattle restaurant called Theoz, and I marveled at how well this wine worked with cuisine that was an innovative blend of Indonesian and Central American cooking. This crisp, dry, elegant 1996 Arneis exhibits a terrific Viognier/Muscat-like fragrance, gorgeous ripe fruit, light to medium body, and super purity. Remarkably, Giacosa produces about 12,000 cases of Arneis, which is bottled early to preserve its freshness.

It is like candy, fleshy, full-bodied, unctuous, and silky. This seamless classic should drink well young, and last for 12-15 years.

2329,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Barolo Falletto,"Giacosa's 1997 Barolo Falletto de Serralunga is an exquisite Barolo offering superb notes of tar, earth, truffles, licorice, minerals, and cherry/raspberry fruit. There is plenty of acidity as well as high tannin, but concentrated, chewy flavors. The wine is tight, dense, impressive, and surprisingly structured for a 1997. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2025.

2331,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Barolo Riserva Falletto,"The 1996 Barolo Falletto de Serralunga (Red Label Riserva) possesses extraordinary presence and stature. Dark garnet/ruby-colored, it offers a tight but promising nose of road tar, scorched earth, truffles, blackberries, cherries, and espresso. This muscular, massive wine gave me chills. It is an exquisite, virtually perfect Barolo that requires a decade of cellaring, and should last for 30-40 years. I remember wishing I were twenty years younger when I tasted it prior to bottling ... I still feel the same way. Awesome! Anticipated maturity: 2010-2040.

2332,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Barbaresco Riserva Asili,"The utterly perfect, dense ruby/purple-colored 1996 Barbaresco Riserva Asili is a heroic offering brilliantly displaying both power and elegance. The bouquet develops incrementally, offering up aromas of black raspberries, cherries, cigar box, licorice, and leather. The wine impresses with its nuances as well as its extraordinarily rich, dense mid-palate, and a finish that lasts nearly a minute. There is huge tannin, but equally massive concentration, extract, and overall harmony. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2025.

2386,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"The 2008 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux from Cathiard is still quite youthful, its nose of ripe plum, currant and spicy soil framed by a lavish application of creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied and supple, with good depth and intensity, the edgy acids of the year balanced by sweet fruit and oak. Though I think Sébastian Cathiard is making more sophisticated wines today, this is an attractively pleasure-bent interpretation of the 2008 vintage.",,RP (92-94)
2387,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2006 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts from Sylvain Cathiard really blossomed in the glass, unfurling to reveal notes of plums, dark chocolate, rich soil, burning embers and some savory and hard-to-define bass notes, its new oak nicely digested at age 12. On the palate, the wine starts out a little foursquare but opens up to become quite expansive, more taut and controlled than the 2005 En Orveaux tasted the following day, with fine-grained but not yet melted tannins, a deep core of fruit and a long finish. An excellent Malconsorts with a full decade ahead of it.",,RP (92-94)
2388,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"The 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux from Sylvain Cathiard is a lavish, dramatically ripe wine that soars from the glass with a decadent bouquet of cherries, blackberry preserve, cassis and dark chocolate, framed by oak vanillin. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, powerful and ample, with a generous core of sweet fruit, fine-grained structuring tannins and sufficient succulent acidity to remain in balance despite its ripeness. Inevitably, this begs the question of to what extent it's a precursor of Cathiard's 2015s: my supposition is the younger vintage will be more precise and controlled at maturity, its oak influence more completely integrated, while retaining the exuberant expression of fruit found in the 2005s. Of course, only time will tell.",,RP (92-94)
2389,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"There are the usual three barrels of 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru this year, two of them new. There is a brooding intensity here, not unlike a Richebourg, more backward than recent vintages that I have tasted, yet after a couple of minutes you are overcome by intoxicating floral aromas that envelop the senses. The palate is medium-bodied with saturated black cherries, cassis, minerals and orange pith, the backbone of the Malconsorts with a very deep, quite grippy finish. Give this a decade in bottle if you can afford to wait that long, or if not, build a time machine.",,RP (92-94)
2390,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts was showing a little more reduction on the nose compared to the other cuvées. Underneath though, lies intense and quite voluminous red berry fruit, later rose petals, a touch of woodland coming through. The palate is medium-bodied with quite high-toned entry, vivacious blueberry fruit mixed with cassis and orange pith, then closing in quickly on a structure and grippy finish (it finished its malolactic not until September so this would explain this). It will require several years in bottle. It is not quite as audacious as the 2015 Malconsorts, but certainly a prince to that king.",,RP (92-94)
2391,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"There are five barrels of the 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots, which Sebastien mentioned was not touched by the frost. It has a graceful, elegant bouquet that unfolds in the glass: precise scents of raspberry and black cherry fruit interlaced by minerals and hints of wilted violet petals. The oak here is very nicely subsumed. The palate is underpinned by succulent tannin, lovely crisp black and red fruit with an almost clinical, precise, focused finish. This will be as good as the 2015, who knows, perhaps even better?",,RP (92-94)
2392,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux, matured in 60% new oak, has a gorgeous bouquet of vibrant maraschino cherry, crushed strawberry, wet limestone and light violets scents that unfold nicely in the glass. The palate is very clean and precise, smooth in texture, but the core of this wine is the inner sphere of sorbet freshness that counters the quite correct structure on the finish that is almost Morey-Saint-Denis in style. This could be the “dark horse” from Cathiard this year? It is equal to the Aux Reignots for sure.",,RP (92-94)
2393,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"The 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers has a precise bouquet, tightly wound at the moment with black cherry, boysenberry and cold stone aromas, much more backward than the Aux Thorey. The palate is medium-bodied with fine grain tannin, tightly knit and focused, tensile with a precise, quite pointed, sorbet-fresh finish. There is something clockwork about this Murgers—every component synchronized the other.",,RP (92-94)
2394,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"Around 25% of the production was lost because of frost with respect to Cathiard’s 2016 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey. It has an extremely floral bouquet loaded with crushed violets, so Vosne-Romanée like in style. Very ostentatious! The palate is medium-bodied with black cherries and blueberry fruit, strict tannin underneath that segue into with a sustained, peppery and quite penetrating finish. Maybe the showiest of Sebastien's wines from barrel, but you know that this is going to give so much joy once in bottle.",,RP (92-94)
2395,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne Romanee,"One-third of the 2016 Vosne-Romanée Village was lost to mildew this year and what survived is raised in 50% new oak. It has a very pure and suave bouquet: precise red berry fruit, sous-bois and cold slate-like aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with strict tannin, clean and fresh with a gorgeous blood orange note that enlivens the tensile red cherry and strawberry fruit on the finish. There is impressive substance to this village cru.",,RP (92-94)
2396,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Coteaux Bourguignons,"A blend of two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Gamay, representing the field blend of a new fermage between Vosne-Romanée and Nuits Saint-Georges, the maiden 2016 Coteaux Bourguignons has a fine, quite lush, blackberry and raspberry scented bouquet. The palate is sweet and quite tensile on the entry, the used oak nicely integrated with a fresh and vibrant finish. This marked a very commendable debut. Hachi nanan.",,RP (92-94)
2397,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2016 Bourgogne Rouge is matured in one-year-old barrels and offers attractive raspberry and crushed strawberry scents, subtle undergrowth scents percolating through with time. The palate is medium-bodied with quite noticeable new oak: dark berry fruit laced with undergrowth. I would just like to see more “Pinoté” come through on the finish.",,RP (92-94)
2398,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"Tasted blind at Flint Wines’ 2007/2012 Nuits Saint-Georges tasting in London. The 2012 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers does not quite have the purity of Hudelot-Noëllat's Aux Murgers on the nose, although the fruit is quite intense, redcurrant, cranberry and blackberry infused with rose petal and iris notes. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe red berry fruit, lovely chalky tannin and great tension, one of the most energetic 2012 Nuits Saint Georges, conveying a persistent and unapologetically sensual finish. It oozes class. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (92-94)
2399,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"Tasted blind at Flint Wines’ 2007/2012 Nuits Saint-Georges tasting in London. The 2012 Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey from Sylvain Cathiard showed better in bottle than in barrel. It has an appealing bouquet with bold ripe raspberry and strawberry aromas, fine mineralité here with focus and harmony. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, crisp acidity, fleshy with impressive depth and a Vosne-like texture towards the cassis-tinged finish. This is a classy number from Sebastien Cathiard, one that has great potential. Tasted November 2016.",,RP (92-94)
2400,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"As usual, there are three barrels of Cathiard's 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru, though whereas historically it was 100% new oak, there are two new and a single one-year-old barrel maturing this wine. It finished its malolactic in June. It has a very composed and pure bouquet that gains in volume with time, with aeration bunches of wilted violet. The palate is medium-bodied with silky tannin, great structure and freshness here, the judicious use of new oak allowing the terroir to show through. It feels correct and strict on the finish, no bravura climax, rather finishing in more understated fashion and keeping you hooked.",,RP (92-94)
2401,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has just a little less new oak than the Les Suchots this year. The aromatics are more backward and recalcitrant than the Les Suchots and demanded more coaxing from the glass. There is a sense of depth to the fruit, almost an opacity that suggests the fruit will only gradually open up. It was difficult wrenching your nose away from the glass! The palate is beautifully balanced with succulent fleshy tannin, voluminous in the mouth with immense concentration counterbalanced by a keen line of acidity. Very persistent in the mouth, this will be immense once in bottle. Cellar for as long as you can.",,RP (92-94)
2402,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots, matured in two-thirds new oak, has a bewitching bouquet that is very pure and intense, layers of dark cherry and wild strawberry fruit tinged with iodine that seems to blossom in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with quite firm tannin and structured, underneath those intense dark berry fruit, a touch of salinity towards the finish that keeps the senses searching and eager for the next sip. Typical of Cathiard's style of winemaking, this is just a brilliant Les Suchots from one of its finest exponents.",,RP (92-94)
2403,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveau was the first of Sebastien Cathiard's cuvées to finish its malolactic. The nose is tightly wound with subtle oyster shell and estuarine scents infusing the dark berry fruit, only reluctantly opening (unlike the more expressive and open Aux Reignots). The palate is sorbet fresh on the entry, but linear and correct, perhaps the most conservative and ""classic"" of Cathiard's 2015s and surely with a propensity to age over many years. One of the most enigmatic of the domaine's 2015, undeniably it is full of class.",,RP (92-94)
2404,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"The 2015 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers has a more expressive bouquet than the Aux Thorey, essentially demonstrating more Pinoté and terroir expression. The palate is showing a little more oakiness at the moment, although there is sufficient fruit to soak that up in time. There is good depth here, a suppleness to the texture with candied orange peel and a touch of cassis towards the caressing finish. Whilst the Aux Thorey is more immediately pleasurable, the Aux Murgers conveys the propitious manner of this vineyard, and has greater long-term potential.",,RP (92-94)
2405,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots has a gorgeous bouquet with mineral-rich red cherry, kirsch and strawberry fruit, quite open and expressive yet still beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp acidity, sorbet-fresh with hints of orange rind permeating the vibrant, fresh, tensile, almost tart red fruit, with a crisp and vivacious, animated finish. This barrel sample had so much energy that I almost asked Sebastien Cathiard for a leash. Electric!",,RP (92-94)
2406,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has an engaging bouquet that is very terroir expressive and well defined. It offers vivid redcurrant and wild strawberry fruit enriched by woodland scents, damp moss and crushed stone. The palate comes across as very structured and saline, quite masculine after tasting the 2015 from barrel, though Sebastien Cathiard pointed out that after a month it seemed to close up. Whilst not quite as riveting as the 2015, it still fulfills the promise of the barrel sample I tasted last year.",,RP (92-94)
2407,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Chambolle Musigny Clos de l'Orme,"The 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Clos de l'Orme, raised in 50% new oak, has a slightly more backward bouquet than the Nuits Saint Georges Villages, even though the malolactic finished a little earlier. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, slightly grainy tannin. There is a slight reduction here, but it dissipates and there is wonderful freshness and precision here. Superb, especially for a ""mere"" village cru.",,RP (92-94)
2408,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits St Georges,"The 2015 Nuits St Georges, matured in 50% new oak, has an upfront and bold bouquet with raspberry coulis, crushed strawberry and rose petal aromas, quite Vosne-like in style. The palate has a little more structure than the Vosne-Romanée Village. There is impressive backbone in situ, slightly grainy in texture and with a mineral, limestone-tinged finish. Another very fine offering from Sebastien Cathiard.",,RP (92-94)
2409,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne Romanee,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée, matured in 50% new oak, finished its malolactic in October. It has a perfumed, quite floral bouquet, a mixture of blackberry and blueberry fruit with just a hint of crushed violet. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, a subtle marine influence with a touch of sea salt on the vibrant finish. I expect this will land at the top of my banded score once in bottle.",,RP (92-94)
2410,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2015 Bourgogne Rouge, which I tasted from a one-year-old barrel, finished in malolactic in September. It has a crisp raspberry preserve and blackberry-scented bouquet, the wood subtle and nicely integrated. The palate is fresh on the entry with a citrus-like component, nimble on its toes with tart red cherries on the finish. Just a delicious generic Burgundy.",,RP (92-94)
2411,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée St Vivant Grand Cru, matured in two-thirds new oak, has an incredibly powerful and pure bouquet that already possesses dizzying, seductive intensity. Wow. The palate has a satin-like texture, perfect acidity and filigree tannin. However, it is the purity of this wine and the shimmering tension on the finish that is totally entrancing. One of the wines of the vintage? Most certainly. Bravo Sebastien.",,RP (92-94)
2412,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1Er Cru les Malconsorts has a very cerebral bouquet, beautifully defined and the fruit here is very enmeshed with the oak. There is something more tertiary -- wild woodland, wild mushroom even tincturing the red and black fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, not as powerful as Cathiard's other 2014 Premier Crus, but with the finest precision on the finish. Its persistence is awe-inspiring.",,RP (92-94)
2413,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots has the most Pinoté on the nose of Cathiard's Premier Crus -- wonderful, effervescent red berry fruit, orange peel, blood orange and limestone scents, all detailed and intense. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, with just a touch of toastiness deriving from the new oak, but this has real finesse and tenderness on the finish that is suffused with blood orange and a touch of spice. This is regal.",,RP (92-94)
2414,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru en Orveaux,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru en Orveau has a more complex bouquet than the Aux Reignots, with delineated, mineral-rich blackberry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate is beautifully balanced with very fine tannin, very focused and tensile, almost crystalline on the very structured finish. This is a real vin de garde and may be one of the best expressions of this vineyard produced by the domaine.",,RP (92-94)
2415,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers has a very different nose to the Aux Thorey, a little more complexity here and less opulence, more black fruit here with blackberry and bilberry, a touch of dark plum. The palate is medium-bodied with a seductive, silky texture; the 60% new oak is seamlessly integrated, but this retains a killer sense of tension on the finish. Controlled power here, controlled power.",,RP (92-94)
2416,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey has a gorgeous bouquet with blueberry and wild strawberry fruit, hints of cassis intermingling with violet, a little creaminess coming from the new oak. The palate is medium-bodied with lithe tannin, and a keen thread of acidity that binds the succulent dark plum and blackberry fruit together. There is a sense of controlled opulence here, very silky in the mouth with a very precise finish that does not hang about like the 2009 I tasted a few weeks earlier. The coolness of this vineyard just curtails any ostentation here and renders this an extremely fine Aux Thorey. ",,RP (92-94)
2417,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Courtesy of the domaine's youngest vines, the 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots has a perfumed, floral bouquet with rose petal scents infusing the mixture of red and black fruit, here the oak is nicely integrated. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannin, veering more towards red fruit with a touch of gaminess and sous-bois towards the finish. Very fine.",,RP (90-92)
2418,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Chambolle Musigny Clos de l'Orme,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny Clos de l'Orme appears to have more pinoté on the nose than the Vosne-Romanée Villages at the moment, perhaps better delineation with citrus-fresh red berry fruit mixed with orange zest wafting temptingly from the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a confit-like opening, red plum and pomegranate, silky in the mouth with a succulent finish. This is a lovely wine from Cathiard. ",,RP (90-92)
2419,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits St Georges,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Villages comprises of just three barrels, two of them new in his vintage. It has a pure and fragrant bouquet: black cherries, a touch of cassis and violets, quite opulent considering this is a village cru. The palate is medium-bodied, creamy on the entry with layers of ripe cassis and black cherry fruit, nicely balanced with a surprisingly opulent finish. An NSG that's a cut above.",,RP (90-92)
2420,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne Romanee,"The 2014 Vosne-Romanée Villages was sampled from a new and one-year old barrel. The nose is very pure and seductive with small dark cherries and blueberry, just a hint of violet in the background. The palate is well balanced with plenty of energy in the wine. The tannins seem quite fine and there is a hint of blood orange towards the effervescent finish. Give it a couple of years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
2421,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Bourgogne Rouge,"The 2014 Bourgogne Rouge, which comes from a single parcel between Vosne-Romanée and Clos Vougeot, has a crisp bouquet with blackberry and briary scents. The palate is well balanced with dusky dark plum and blackberry fruit, quite citric towards the finish that just needs to brighten up a little. ",,RP (90-92)
2422,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts from winemaker Sebastian Cathiard was showing some reduction like de Montille's Malconsorts: rather animally on the nose with a touch of rubber, missing the delineation it might have otherwise possessed. Returning after ten minutes, that feral aspect ebbs away. The palate is medium-bodied with supple and sweet tannin. It shakes off that reduction to reveal a nicely defined, quite voluminous finish that is bursting with red fruit. If it does pull through it will deserve a very good mark and I suspect it will do just that.",,RP (90-92)
2423,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru En Orveau was showing a bit of VA on the nose, although it merely lifts the kirsch and cassis fruit. It bit gaudy perhaps? The palate is medium-bodied with sweet, slightly oaky entry, lower acidity than its peers, generous and smooth but missing complexity and nuance on the finish. It gives easy-drinking pleasure, but unlike when I tasted this from barrel, I am less convinced that it merits long-term cellaring.",,RP (90-92)
2424,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Malconsorts 2004 does everything to convince me that I had this brilliant wine correct when I tasted it from barrel. Deep in colour, there is an initial burst of red berry fruit intermingling with shaved black truffle and cigar box, a little autumnal perhaps, but very well defined. The palate has real guts and substance, the new oak melded into the fabric of the wine, silky smooth in texture with a vitamin-like purity toward the energetic finish. What a great les Malconsorts from Cathaird. You can see it lasting two decades without too much problem.",,RP (90-92)
2425,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, this bottle of Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Malconsorts 2001 from Sylvain Cathiard merely reaffirmed by opinion that he has produced much better wines in other vintages. Here it has a candied blackcurrant and truffle-scented bouquet with an odd tree-bark scent. The palate is structured and dense, but it is missing the finesse and elegance of a premier cru and feels just a little monotonous on the finish, I suspect because of excessive use of new oak.",,RP (90-92)
2426,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Suchots, which sees 100% new oak (reduced to two-thirds next year), has an intense, candied bouquet whereby the strawberry coulis and kirsch scents permeate through that carapace of new wood. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins, quite racy acidity and superb mineralité on the focused finish. It will require several years to absorb the new wood, but it will be worth the wait. It is a brilliant follow-up to the 2012.",,RP (90-92)
2427,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru was showing a bit of reduction when I tasted it from barrel. With some rigorous coaxing it reluctantly reveals wild strawberry mixed with bergamot and rose petals, hints of fig jam in the background. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannins and a palpable sense of energy and precision. There is symmetry on the end that you look for in a Grand Cru, and a persistent finish that goes on and on and on. Superb, but what else would you expect?",,RP (90-92)
2428,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne Romanee 1er Cru en Orveaux,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru en Orveaux, raised in two-thirds new oak, has a succinct and complex bouquet with perhaps more mineralité than the Aux Reignots. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red fruit. There is certainly good weight in the mouth here, plus a sense of symmetry toward the long, silky finish. This is a classy, sophisticated Vosne-Romanée that punches well above its weight - an outstanding success for Sebastien Cathiard.",,RP (90-92)
2429,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Murgers, raised in 80% new oak like the Aux Thorey, has a more exotic bouquet than the Murgers, spicier, and there is a greater proportion of black fruit in evidence. The palate is medium-bodied, masculine and structured, reserved on the entry, with blackberry, raspberry and just a touch of licorice coming through on the finish that is more in sync with the new oak than the Aux Thorey. Give this gem three or four years in bottle.",,RP (90-92)
2430,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Malconsorts, raised 80% in new oak, has a slightly introspective nose at the moment: dark berry fruit, touch of bergamot here and there, but fleeting glimpses only. The palate is medium-bodied with a strict lattice of tannin. This is rigid and uncompromising with a stern saline finish that means business and perhaps as a consequence I find more nascent charm enveloping the Suchots at the moment. Cellar this for five or six years and it will surely reward those with patience.",,RP (90-92)
2431,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots, which is matured in 50% new wood this year, has a fragrant bouquet with pure strawberry, kirsch and orange sorbet scents. The palate is medium-bodied, tensile in the mouth, with racy acidity and a linear, vivacious, animated finish. Great potential here for sure, but it will require five or six years in bottle. It will be fascinating to plot its evolution against the Les Suchots.",,RP (90-92)
2432,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey, which is matured in 80% new oak, has a very seductive, nicely defined bouquet with strawberry and cranberry scents combining with cold limestone aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with confit red berry fruit on the entry, fine structure with a gentle grip on the marine influenced finish. This is a very fine Aux Thorey, although it would have been enhanced with say, 50% new oak rather than 80%.",,RP (90-92)
2433,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges Village,"There are just two barrels of the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Villages, one of them new. It has a broody bouquet with touches of black plum and woodlands scents, the oak not quite as assimilated as the Vosne Villages. The palate is medium-bodied with candied orange peel on the entry, hints of marmalade and citrus fruit, gently building to a clean and precise finish. Very fine. ",,RP (90-92)
2434,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée Village has a gentle lilting crushed strawberry and Morello-scented bouquet that wafts from the glass, neatly carrying the 50% new oak. The palate is medium-bodied with quite sharp tannin on the entry, crisp malic acidity with a pointed tart cherry finish. This is a fine introduction to the delights of this domaine's wines. ",,RP (90-92)
2435,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Chambolle-Musigny Les Clos de l'Orme,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny Clos de l’Orme has a fresh and lifted nose of raspberry preserve, maraschino, a hint of cola and sous-bois aromas that unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a rigid backbone that lends this a masculine, slightly aloof personality at the moment. It is nicely focused, but it needs to just let its hair down a little on the finish. It is perhaps just a little too reserved for a Chambolle.",,RP (90-92)
2436,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge, which is aged in one-year old oak entirely, has a brisk nose with plenty of ripe strawberry and cranberry notes. The palate is medium-bodied with a confit opening: crushed strawberry and a touch of maraschino, brisk 'nn breezy with a pointed, citrus-tinged finish. Enjoy over the next two or three years, possibly longer.",,RP (90-92)
2437,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Compared to the other four Malconsorts ‘11s in this peer group, the Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts 2011 from Sylvain Cathiard has the most vivacious red fruit on the nose with joyous red cherries, redcurrant and fresh strawberry scents. You might call this a carefree bouquet. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins and a keen line of acidity, but it does not deliver the same structure or complexity on the finish as others. This is still a fine Malconsorts that will benefit from several years in the cellar.",,RP (90-92)
2438,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Initially, the Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey from Cathiard seems to have a lot of oak smothering the sappy black fruit, although with aeration it coalesces nicely and develops attractive floral scents. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity cutting through the thickset fruit. This feels a little primal and flirts with over-extraction but I think it does not step over the mark. Give this 5-6 years and this could turn into a fine Nuits Saint Georges. ",,RP (90-92)
2439,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Sylvain Cathiard’s 2011 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru aux Reignots, tasted blind in a line-up of 2011 Amoureuses in Holland, reveals a clear color as well as a gorgeous bouquet that is pure and seductive, quite floral in style, with very fine delineation and mineralite. This is generous at the moment, a little showy and seductive but not as nuanced or as complex as the 2010. The palate is medium-bodied and quite chewy in the mouth. There is good extraction here although it is missing finesse toward the finish. Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2440,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"I recall tasting the 2005 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts from barrel with Sylvain back in 2007 and thinking something along the lines of “Wow.” And despite being first in the line-up of many older vintages, this still ranks as one of Sylvain’s finest creations. It has a pure and precocious mint-tinged nose that is almost crystalline in its purity, deftly handling the new oak and retaining its youthful zeal. There is a sense of symmetry and precision on the palate – not a hair out of place. The fruit is slightly darker than its ’02 counterpart tasted alongside. The finish offers a gentle crescendo that risks leaving the imbiber stupefied. Give it a few more years, but this is one case where I empathize with infanticide. Drink 2017-2030+  Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2441,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2002 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts is beginning to drink extremely well. It has a lucid garnet core that is still quite youthful given that it now has a little mileage in bottle. The bouquet is exquisite. There is nothing shy and retiring here, with open and generous raspberry, orange sorbet and hints of gingerbread bursting forth but remaining tightly controlled and focused. The palate is ripe on the entry with firm but fine tannins. This is still a little masculine with a strong saline tang at first, gradually mutating into touches of star anis and cooked meat. It retains superb structure, and is a Les Malconsorts built for the long haul. Wonderful! Drink 2018-2030.  Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2442,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Reignots,"Poured from a rare magnum, this is the first time I have tasted Sylvain Cathiard’s 2001 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Reignots in bottle. Here, it seems very closed on the nose and perhaps a little smudged relative to the Les Malconsorts ’02. Give it time though, because a subtle marine-influence begins to emerge as seaweed and mudflats influence the broody black and red fruit. The palate is sweet and sorbet-fresh on the entry, and there is patently good structure here. It does not quite have the poise of Sylvain’s other crus, although there is fine tension on the orange-peel-tinged finish that lingers nicely in the mouth. Certainly on the basis of this magnum, I would be inclined to leave this suave number for another three or four years. Drink 2016-2026.  Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2443,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"I must confess that I was expecting to enjoy the 1998 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts more than I did. It has a fungal, potent undergrowth-scented bouquet with darker fruit than the 1996. It is medium-bodied and quite glossy with noticeable creamy new oak that is not quite as resolved with the fruit as I would have liked at this stage, with plenty of bottle age. It is also a little animally on the finish. Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2444,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 1996 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts has a deep brick color. The nose is standoff-ish at first, checking you out before agreeing to scents of black fruit, wild heather and a touch of licorice. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins and is nicely focused, although it is not as complex as more recent vintages and the oak is a little conspicuous towards the sinewy and rather foursquare finish. Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2445,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"Two bottles of the Sylvain Cathiard 1990 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts were opened. The better bottle has a healthy color with some bricking on the rim. The nose is linear compared to other 1990s: reluctantly but eventually acquiescing to reveal singed leather, blackberry, tree bark and undergrowth notes. The palate is medium-bodied and feels surprisingly firm in the mouth considering the vintage. It is not as complex as more recent examples of Les Malconsorts, although there is good depth of fruit and there is no heat on the finish, a characteristic that can sometimes mar wines from this vintage. With time, it offers attractive savory scents that filter through onto the palate, and it seems to settle down. Tasted June 2014.",,RP (90-92)
2446,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"The 2002 Les Suchots from Cathiard is turning into a little beauty. The nose is very complex with subtle sous-bois scents furnishing the detailed red currant and red cherry fruit. It seems linear at first but then opens up and gains depth. The palate is very well-balanced, the 100% new oak now fully assimilated and lending this Suchots weight and length without impeding that exuberant Suchots character. Feel free to broach bottles now, though I think this has more to give in the future. Drink now-2020+.",,RP (90-92)
2447,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Murgers,"I recall this 2007 Nuits Saint Georges aux Murger being delicious from barrel. With a half a dozen years or so in bottle, it is dutifully blossoming into one beautiful Pinot Noir. Youthful in color, the nose attests to the relatively high proportion of new oak, although it is sutured into the fruit profile of mulberry, yellow plum and crushed strawberries all well-defined. The palate has the weight of a more precocious vintage, although part of that emanates from the oak. You could describe it as a modern style of Burgundy, but one adroitly pulled off, with a silky and harmonious finish with not a hard edge in sight. This superb wine is drinking beautifully now, but it should keep for another ten years. Drink now-2024.  Tasted January 2014.

2448,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts has a graphite-tinged bouquet that seems almost flinty, with sharp and focused tart red fruits that take a little time to mellow. The palate is medium-bodied with chalky tannins, crisp acidity and a leafy but weighty/structured finish that lingers in the mouth. This is a Vosne 2011 that deserves three of four years in bottle before broaching. Drink 2016-2028. 

Sebastian Cathiard kindly offered two or three examples of the 2011 vintage after tasting through his 2012s at the domaine.

2449,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanee Village has a very precise, stony bouquet with dark-cherry fruit infused with forest-floor aromas that gently unfolds in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with black pepper on the opening. It displays fine balance, but shows just a little too much wood towards the slightly herbaceous finish. Drink now-2022.

2450,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"There are three barrels of the 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from 75-year old vines. It has a fragrant bouquet that offers a smorgasbord of red berry fruits and minerals to the point where the new wood in imperceptible. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, ripe tannins and very well judged acidity. The finish is more linear that other vintages that I have tried from barrel, nicely focused with a touch of spice popping up on the extraordinary long aftertaste.

This publication is not faultless, though we all strive to be so. But I must confess that I was flabbergasted when I searched the Wine Advocate database to find no reviews for Sylvain Cathiard’s wines since the mid-noughties. The reason is that here in the UK, Cathiard’s reputation has been ascendant for over a decade and the name is presently revered as one of the top exponents of Vosne-Romanee. The domaine was established in the 1930s when their fruit was sold to local negoce as was common back in those days. According to Clive Coates, Alfred Cathiard moved to Burgundy in 1901 and worked at Domaine de la Romanee-Conti and yes, in case you were wondering, the family is distantly related to the Cathiard’s chez Chateau Smith Haut-Lafitte. Sylvain’s father Andre ran the estate from 1969 until 1985, his son becoming more involved in the latter years. He began to rent his vines from his family supplemented by fermage agreements, before taking over his father’s own vines when Andre retired in 1995. The wines during the early 1990s were a little rustic, but throughout that decade Sylvain honed his style, producing refined, intense, terroir-driven wines that used healthy percentages of quality new oak to lend them a modern sheen, not unlike say Lalou Bize-Leroy nearby. This is when I myself became acquainted with the name, courtesy of my girlfriend (now wife) who was working for one of his UK distributors, Berry Brothers & Rudd. Back in the late 1990s, you could pick up one of his premier crus for around twenty quid and that was before her staff discount. Given my relationship with the domaine, which I have visited regularly, I made sure to redress this situation with respect to the 2012s, not that their wines are easy to obtain. Sylvain and occasionally his wife Odette, was always a congenial host, a noble paysan usually attired in the same old jumper with the calloused hands of lifetime labor. The reins have been handed over to his son Sebastian who has worked in Chablis, at Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte and Fromm in Marlborough, New Zealand, undertaking his first “solo” vintage at the domaine in 2011 – always good to have a global perspective. As far as I know, the handover was not as smooth as it could be and the two endured what Clive Coates describe as “a difficult winter” in 2010/11. But everything has now been resolved between father and son and Sebastian is fully in charge. Indeed, from our first meeting when he barely uttered a syllable, he’s fast matured into an assured young vigneron, balancing the weight of expectation with fostering his own ideas for the new chapter, his new chapter. During this time he oversaw the construction of a new winery and cellars that were completed in 2008, relieving the somewhat cramped conditions that Sylvain worked in. They have a glittering array of parcels centered around Vosne-Romanee, including choice cuts of premier crus crowned by a glorious Romanee-Saint-Vivant, whose price has rocketed in recent years (and you can see why if you are lucky enough to taste it.) Sylvain’s modus operandi has always been minimalist intervention in the vineyard (lutte raisonee), the fruit completely de-stemmed after rigorous sorting, employing around 40% new oak for the village crus, 60% and above for the premier crus and 100% for the grand crus, with no fining or filtering since 2000.  In a frank exchange with Sebastian, whose candor I appreciate, I think this is a domaine that is going to head in a new direction. He spoke about using less new oak in the future, something that has been leveled by Burgundy connoisseurs in the past, who felt that less new wood would create more terroir-driven wines. I would concur with that sentiment. While I would continue using 100% new oak for the Romanee-Saint-Vivant and perhaps the Malconsorts subject to growing season, I would tweak the oak for the other premier crus that occasionally do threaten to be overwhelmed by the new oak. We also conversed about whole clusters. At the moment everything is de-stemmed and although Sebastian expressed no plans to alter that practice, I did urge him just to consider experimenting a little with one of the premier crus...just to see if the results work out. If it goes wrong, blame me. Similar to other growers, the malo-lactics were late, in particular the Malconsorts and Aux Reignots that did not finish until July. As I have mentioned, these notes are probably more relevant to those in Europe where Cathiard’s major markets are located, but readers should be aware of this top-drawer grower who I suspect will be even more revered in the future.

It has a very open and generous bouquet with brambly red berry fruit and rose petals. – all very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, succulent tannins, hints of coffee bean infusing the red fruit and lending exoticism towards the finish. Punchy and ravishing: this is what you want for your Suchots.

After allowing a few minutes of the reduction to blow away, it reveals a lovely bouquet drenched in mineral-rich dark berry fruit – blackberry and blueberry on full song. The palate is medium-bodied and tightly wound at the moment but there is a wonderful sense of symmetry and poise. This is a brilliant wine.

The palate is medium-bodied with chalky tannins: pure black cherry and raspberry fruit with vanilla-laced oak defining the finish at the moment, though that will meld with time.

Back in the late 1990s, you could pick up one of his premier crus for around twenty quid and that was before her staff discount. Given my relationship with the domaine, which I have visited regularly, I made sure to redress this situation with respect to the 2012s, not that their wines are easy to obtain. Sylvain and occasionally his wife Odette, was always a congenial host, a noble paysan usually attired in the same old jumper with the calloused hands of lifetime labor. The reins have been handed over to his son Sebastian who has worked in Chablis, at Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte and Fromm in Marlborough, New Zealand, undertaking his first “solo” vintage at the domaine in 2011 – always good to have a global perspective. As far as I know, the handover was not as smooth as it could be and the two endured what Clive Coates describe as “a difficult winter” in 2010/11. But everything has now been resolved between father and son and Sebastian is fully in charge. Indeed, from our first meeting when he barely uttered a syllable, he’s fast matured into an assured young vigneron, balancing the weight of expectation with fostering his own ideas for the new chapter, his new chapter. During this time he oversaw the construction of a new winery and cellars that were completed in 2008, relieving the somewhat cramped conditions that Sylvain worked in. They have a glittering array of parcels centered around Vosne-Romanee, including choice cuts of premier crus crowned by a glorious Romanee-Saint-Vivant, whose price has rocketed in recent years (and you can see why if you are lucky enough to taste it.) Sylvain’s modus operandi has always been minimalist intervention in the vineyard (lutte raisonee), the fruit completely de-stemmed after rigorous sorting, employing around 40% new oak for the village crus, 60% and above for the premier crus and 100% for the grand crus, with no fining or filtering since 2000.  In a frank exchange with Sebastian, whose candor I appreciate, I think this is a domaine that is going to head in a new direction. He spoke about using less new oak in the future, something that has been leveled by Burgundy connoisseurs in the past, who felt that less new wood would create more terroir-driven wines. I would concur with that sentiment. While I would continue using 100% new oak for the Romanee-Saint-Vivant and perhaps the Malconsorts subject to growing season, I would tweak the oak for the other premier crus that occasionally do threaten to be overwhelmed by the new oak. We also conversed about whole clusters. At the moment everything is de-stemmed and although Sebastian expressed no plans to alter that practice, I did urge him just to consider experimenting a little with one of the premier crus...just to see if the results work out. If it goes wrong, blame me. Similar to other growers, the malo-lactics were late, in particular the Malconsorts and Aux Reignots that did not finish until July. As I have mentioned, these notes are probably more relevant to those in Europe where Cathiard’s major markets are located, but readers should be aware of this top-drawer grower who I suspect will be even more revered in the future.

2456,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges Village,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges Villages comes from a single 0.13-hectare parcel to the north of the appellation. It has a very pure bouquet with scents of bright red cherries and fresh strawberry that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with wood dominating the entry and then the red vivacious fruit surfaces and starts to party towards the finish. Alas there are just three barrels produced this year, but it is worth tracking a bottle down if you can. The premier crus had not been racked and received a little sulfur one week before my visit. 

This publication is not faultless, though we all strive to be so. But I must confess that I was flabbergasted when I searched the Wine Advocate database to find no reviews for Sylvain Cathiard’s wines since the mid-noughties. The reason is that here in the UK, Cathiard’s reputation has been ascendant for over a decade and the name is presently revered as one of the top exponents of Vosne-Romanee. The domaine was established in the 1930s when their fruit was sold to local negoce as was common back in those days. According to Clive Coates, Alfred Cathiard moved to Burgundy in 1901 and worked at Domaine de la Romanee-Conti and yes, in case you were wondering, the family is distantly related to the Cathiard’s chez Chateau Smith Haut-Lafitte. Sylvain’s father Andre ran the estate from 1969 until 1985, his son becoming more involved in the latter years. He began to rent his vines from his family supplemented by fermage agreements, before taking over his father’s own vines when Andre retired in 1995.

2457,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2012 Bourgogne Rouge comes from a 0.27-hectare parcel of 30-year old vines, so there is not even a great deal of their entry-level wine. It had been racked the previous day. The aromatics appear clean and pure with dark cherry and blueberry scents. The palate is nicely balanced with plenty of red cherry and dark plum fruit. Nice weight here – this should be a decent Burgundy Rouge.

2458,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru En Orveaux,"Lightly-cooked cherry and plum are alluringly tinged with nutmeg and bitter-sweet iris florality on the nose of the Cathiard 2006 Vosne-Romanee En Orveaux, then migrate to a polished palate and inform a generous, lingering finish in which hints of vanilla and resin from barrel are harmoniously intertwined with the wine's naturally sweet spiciness and florality. This shows real elegance, and the subtle suggestion of things mineral that emerges as it opens to the air point the way toward future complexity. I would expect it to be worth following for at least 6-8 years. 

My report in issue 171 was in error – as both Cathiard and de Montille let me know – in reporting that Cathiard's production of wine from this cru would drop dramatically in consequence of his having agreed to compensation for relinquishing his lease on a share of its acreage. In fact, the portion of Malconsorts that Cathiard farmed under that former agreement never informed his domaine bottling, whose production level will thus be uninfluenced by its absence. Sylvain Cathiard said sorting out rot was not a major challenge for him in 2006 (but in 2007, yes) and that at most 10% of fruit was rejected. Unfortunately, he did not offer me the opportunity to taste half of his wines and I was unable to catch up with them subsequently.

2459,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Thorey,"The Cathiard 2006 Nuits St.-Georges Aux Thorey comes from a portion of that cru deeded to him as part of the arrangement made when Dujac and de Montille purchased Thomas-Molliard, on a portion of whose Vosne-Romanee Malconsorts Cathiard had a lease. There is a superficial oak character here (from 80% new barrels) atypical for this address, along with fresh red berries and purple plum, wreathed in pungent suggestions of wood smoke and sweet, lily-like floral perfume. Faintly detached tannins kick in on the finish of what is otherwise an extroverted, ripe, flatteringly polished performance that should remain worth witnessing for at least the next 5-7 years.

2460,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Vosne-Romanée Village,"Cathiard's 2006 Vosne-Romanee displays intriguing carnal and floral notes from nose to finish, but is also informed of ripe red fruits as well as a flatteringly silken texture and lift that reflects his expressed desire to extract very gently and emphasize the delicacy of fruit and mineral refinement he sees as vintage fortes. The finish here is satisfyingly lip-smacking without trying to grip or make a big statement. This should remain delightfully proportional and versatile over the next 4-6 years.

2461,Domaine Sylvain Cathiard,Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The Cathiard 2005 Romanee-St.-Vivant evinces aromas and flavors of ripe cassis and black raspberry, tinged with pepper, clove, star anise, iris, and citrus rind. Lush and enveloping on the palate, with a flattering, creamy texture, this trades a bit of the clarity that other wines displayed here today for sheer richness and ripeness of finish. But the length certainly bespeaks grand cru. Also recommended: 2005 Bourgogne ($39.00;85).

Quite creamy in texture, with chalky, smoky, brown spice, and floral inner-mouth character, this acts like a Nuits that could be Vosne. The combination of clarity with creaminess in the finish is uncanny. Also recommended: 2005 Bourgogne ($39.00;85).

Cassis, black raspberry, wood smoke, nutmeg, coconut, coffee, and cumin in the nose lead to an infectiously-juicy, indeed positively exuberant palate impression, with silken smoothness and lovely clarity of fruit. The oak is subtle, and the fruit meets it more than half way. Also recommended: 2005 Bourgogne ($39.00;85).

Boasting bright, fresh, ripe red raspberry aromas, this comes onto the palate with surprising creaminess, with salted meat stock underpinnings to its persistently bright, infectiously juicy, lightly caramel-tinged fruit. Such a tender, delicate, refined Pinot is what Burgundians would traditionally call “tres Chambolle.” It should make ravishing drinking anytime over the next several years.

His vines in Reignots are only approaching twenty years of age. Interestingly, I recently revisited the last vintage from old vines, 1987, and that wine was still attractive, if a bit attenuated.

2488,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"The 2012 Morey-Saint-Denis Villages has a fragrant nose of brambly red fruit, wild hedgerow and a touch of earth. This opens nicely with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied, fresh and lively with a crisp line of acidity and great tension on the finish. This is a very fine village cru demonstrating structure and presence.

2489,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Chambolle-Musigny Village,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny Village needs to develop more harmony on the nose, but develops some lovely baked red cherry scents mixed with bergamot. The palate is well-balanced with nicely judged acidity and crisp mineralite on the pointed finish. This is fine for a village cru, although I might opt for the Morey Saint Denis, which shows a little more persistency at present.

The palate is medium-bodied and pierced by a fine line of acidity. This is nicely balanced with a pretty floral finish that should fill out by the time of bottling.

2492,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru,"The elusive 2012 Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru was matured in a single new barrel this year, around 170-litres just in case you were thinking of ordering a palette or two. It has a very attractive, generous bouquet with brambly red berry fruit and minerals, supporting that new wood with ease. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded tannins, plenty of spicy red fruit and a lovely airiness to it. It certainly copes with the new wood very competently and it is well integrated. You will never see a bottle – but it is actually lovely wine. 

Unfortunately, on this occasion I have deferred posting scores for most of Domaine Taupenot-Merme’s 2012s, not as an indication of quality, but because after I informed Romain Taupenot that they just did not taste “correct,” he later discovered that the samples had been taken too abruptly from tank and had been given insufficient time to settle. Therefore, I will review those wines next year and for the time being, focus on the samples that were representative, mainly from his negociant arm and ironically, from his grand cru that is virtually impossible to find (but since the sample came directly from barrel was at least as it should be!) “It was a nightmare vintage during the growing season,” Romain told me, probably unaware that his nightmare was continuing as his 2012 samples froze onstage. “We had every disease apart from grey rot. Yields in Gevrey were above that of Chambolle and Morey, at around 37 hectoliters per hectare. We never used more than 40% new oak as I want to express the terroir.” As I mentioned, I will return some time next year to reappraise them.

2493,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Mazoyeres-Chambertin Grand Cru, which is populated by 54-year-old vines with a propensity for small berries due to millerandage, has a fuller and more aromatic bouquet when compared directly against the Charmes-Chambertin 2011, perfumed with lascivious ripe strawberry and cranberry aromas suffused with cold stone. The palate is medium-bodied with supple and fine tannins. It has a pleasant build in the mouth and yet the finish is understated, classic in style and very refined. This is just a Mazoyeres that you will want to abscond with. Drink now-2022.

It has a pinched bouquet that opens nicely in the glass and offers attractive fresh strawberry, jasmine and undergrowth scents. The palate is smooth and rounded on the entry. This is very nicely composed with fine tannins and well-integrated oak, building gently to a raspberry and wild strawberry finish. This is one of the domaine’s best 2011s. Drink 2014-2022.

The palate has an attractive supple red berry fruit, red cherries and raspberry that are interlaced by fine tannins. However, it is missing a little cohesion toward the finish. Still, there is a good length here and it should drink well over the next 8-10 years. Drink now-2020.

No, there is not the length of a more benevolent season, but there is great poise and tension allied with a directness that would make it a superb match at the dinner table. Drink now-2017.

Romain remarked that he discerns more minerality in this cuvee due to the age of the vines and that comes through in this wine. The palate is medium-bodied with a crisp blackberry and raspberry entry. It is tightly-wound at first and then opens nicely with a bright vivacious finish. Very fine. Drink now-2020.

The palate is medium-bodied with a fine structure, though it seems foursquare and shows slight attenuation toward the finish. It actually showed better when re-tasted a month later at the domaine when it exhibited finer precision. Drink 2014-2020.

The palate is full in the mouth with soft, supple tannins. The acidity is nicely measured, although it still does not quite possess the tension of the 2011 when tasted alongside.

The aromatics are expressive and intensely perfumed, but at the moment it is the weight of the year that comes through most. The seductive finish is incredibly inviting.

Taupenot-Merme farms 13 hectares across 19 appellations. The vineyards have been farmed organically since 2001. The wines are made in a style that seeks textural richness. The fruit is 100% destemmed and undergoes a cold soak of 7-9 days, prior to fermentation. The wines are racked into steel to allow for a natural decantation and then moved into oak, where they spend 12-15 months on the fine lees. New oak tops out at 40% for the Grand Crus.

In 2008 the Pruliers shows the more reserved and understated side of the house style. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028.  

Taupenot-Merme farms 13 hectares across 19 appellations. The vineyards have been farmed organically since 2001. The wines are made in a style that seeks textural richness. The fruit is 100% destemmed and undergoes a cold soak of 7-9 days, prior to fermentation. The wines are racked into steel to allow for a natural decantation and then moved into oak, where they spend 12-15 months on the fine lees. New oak tops out at 40% for the Grand Crus. The 2009 harvest started on September 11. Yields were high relative to past years, but the estate had a lot of millerandage (shot berries). Romain Taupenot describes his 2009s as having a high level of malic acid, which delayed malos by the standards of this estate.

2539,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Taupenots’ 2008 Charmes Chambertin displays kirsch as well as candied cherry on the nose, which are allied to (or is that pitted against?) tart rhubarb on a bright, firm palate. This is suffused with both chalky and invigoratingly saline mineral manifestations; rose hip, cherry pit, and smoky black tea adding further, piquant complexity that follows into a long, lip-smacking finish. An extreme expression of its cru, it will strike some tasters as too lean, tart, and bitter, but I find it not quite too much of the above three and tonic-like in its fascination and vivacity. 

Romain Taupenot is clearly taking important steps to build on his family’s experience and do justice to their extensive list of appellations in parcels spread out along the Cote d’Or (and in both Pinot and Chardonnay). My tastings of wines from the last three vintages turned up some fine and above all highly distinctive bottlings which, if I were to guess, will probably please some pinotphiles more than my scores might suggest, and please the rest less! Taupenot – who prefers closed fermentors in order, he claims, to prevent influence of the yeasts in one batch on this in another – opined that his raw material in 2008 permitted sparing punch-downs in the early stage of fermentation, whereas he did not trust his 2007 fruit to respond well to as aggressive a regimen of extraction. “You had to be careful not to do too-short maceration in 2008” though, he maintains, “because whereas usually the extraction of tannin in the presence of alcohol is steady, in 2008 the tannin was not extracted until very late.” The 2008s here had been bottled a month before my February visit, all with light filtration, because, Taupenot says, “the levels of turbidity I measured were too high for me to omit filtration, whereas in 2007 I bottled some of the wines without filtration.” This estate is perhaps best known for their few rows of Clos de Lambrays, on account of which that site misses being a monopole of the Domaine des Lambrays; but as I did not have time to taste the entire Taupenot-Merme range, I did not insist on sampling the less-than-barrique-sized quantity of that particular cru.

2540,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru La Riotte,"From a little-known cru sandwiched between Blanchards and Millandes (and a portion of which is in vines the Taupenots planted in 1937) their 2008 Morey-St.-Denis La Riotte displays a density and fine grain of tannin comparable to the corresponding Chambolle Combes d’Orveaux, here with ripe purple plum and dark cherry shadowed by their distilled counterparts and high-toned almond extract, lemon oil, and ginseng. Bright and lithe on the palate, this could use a bit of filling-out – which may well come with time – but even its almost ethereal outline is impressive, and I’d bet on 8-10 years of high performance here.

2541,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Bel-Air,"The Taupenot-Merme 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin Bel Air – from that small, intriguing site above Clos de Beze – follows the apparent pattern for the domaine in this vintage by featuring kirsch and plum distillate laced with citrus oil in a high-toned display that some may consider overly volatile but I find entrancing. A mouthful of tart cherry, plum, red currant, and chalk dust seemingly leaves it to the freshly butchered raw meat of the animal that has eaten them to reveal the herbs and flowers one looks for from this sector. (I beg apology for any inadvertent offense to advocates of vegetarianism.) This is admittedly relatively spare, but conveys fascinating complexity and real finishing energy, not to mention sheer refreshment (which admittedly, will not be high on everyone’s list of red wine values). I would anticipate at least 8-10 very active years of life.

2542,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru,"As might correctly be inferred from the existence of a Taupenot family 2008 Mazoyeres-Chambertin – from a large parcel planted in 1959 – their Charmes is all from the true Charmes rather than any of it being from Mazoyeres. Surprisingly at odds with the character of that Charmes, this Mazoyeres displays a very gamey, almost acridly smoky nose – certainly in part a function of reduction, but not one I could shake-off. Medicinal herbs strike a more typical Morey-side note and the sense of meatiness is cleaner on the palate, mingling with herbal concentrate and bitter-edged dark berries and tinged with black pepper, all impressively long-lasting. While anything but winsome, this certainly merits revisiting, and its abundant but fine-grained tannin – not to mention its overall reductive cast – encourage the belief that it will hold up robustly for at least a decade.

2543,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru La Combe d'Orveau,"Almost entirely from vines planted in 1942, the Taupenot-Merme 2008 Chambolle-Musigny Combes d’Orveaux displays some of the same prominent tartness that characterized the village-level wines of its collection – and which might have been accentuated by recent bottling – but here there is an impressive sense of density allied to levity; and a sweetness to the tart-edged red currant and cherry fruit – mingled with rose hip, cinnamon ginger, and meat broth – that really convinces. Hints of chalk and cherry pit contribute to a vibrant sense of fruit-mineral-spice interplay in a lip-smacking finish. I would bet on this conspicuously high-elevation, structurally fine-grained Chambolle being worth following for close to a decade.

2544,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Auxey-Duresses 1er Cru,"Taupenot’s 2008 Auxey Duresses 1er Cru – a blend from his parcels in Duresses and nearby Grands Champs, first essayed in 2007 – offers a fresh dark cherry and plum matrix tinged with the bitterness of their pits and a slightly austere sense of chalkiness. But the combination of density with fine grain, sheer levity, and high-energy brightness easily convinces me that this will be worth following for at least half a dozen years.

2545,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"Taupenot-Merme’s 2008 Morey-St.-Denis – largely from the Les Porroux below Clos de la Bussieres – evinces game; tart purple plum and dark cherry; smoky black tea; and high-toned, medicinal herbal extracts. With firm but in the context of the present collection relatively fine tannins, this finishes with sap and invigoration of a certain austerity thanks to the combination of tartness and bitter herbal notes. I suspect it will tone down in a few years and make for satisfaction until at least age 6. From quite numerous and disparate parcels, the corresponding Gevrey-Chambertin was a bit more high-toned and strident.

Taupenot – who prefers closed fermentors in order, he claims, to prevent influence of the yeasts in one batch on this in another – opined that his raw material in 2008 permitted sparing punch-downs in the early stage of fermentation, whereas he did not trust his 2007 fruit to respond well to as aggressive a regimen of extraction. “You had to be careful not to do too-short maceration in 2008” though, he maintains, “because whereas usually the extraction of tannin in the presence of alcohol is steady, in 2008 the tannin was not extracted until very late.” The 2008s here had been bottled a month before my February visit, all with light filtration, because, Taupenot says, “the levels of turbidity I measured were too high for me to omit filtration, whereas in 2007 I bottled some of the wines without filtration.” This estate is perhaps best known for their few rows of Clos de Lambrays, on account of which that site misses being a monopole of the Domaine des Lambrays; but as I did not have time to taste the entire Taupenot-Merme range, I did not insist on sampling the less-than-barrique-sized quantity of that particular cru.

2553,Domaine Taupenot-Merme,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Smoky Latakia tobacco and black tea scent the Taupenot 2007 Charmes-Chambertin, accenting lightly-cooked cherry and rhubarb along with meat stock on a polished palate. This finishes just a bit diffuse and warm, though with admirable sheer persistence. I can’t see wanting to hold it past a half dozen years though.

The energy of 2008 suits this style better, but this relatively lightweight Chambolle still carries attractive salt and chalk nuances into a persistently juicy finish of a sort that can by no means be taken for granted in this vintage.

The fruit is 100% destemmed and undergoes a cold soak of 7-9 days, prior to fermentation. The wines are racked into steel to allow for a natural decantation and then moved into oak, where they spend 12-15 months on the fine lees. New oak tops out at 40% for the Grand Crus. The 2009 harvest started on September 11. Yields were high relative to past years, but the estate had a lot of millerandage (shot berries). Romain Taupenot describes his 2009s as having a high level of malic acid, which delayed malos by the standards of this estate.

2577,Antinori,Corton-Rognet Grand Cru,"The estate’s 2008 Corton-Rognets is another delicate, elegant wine from Taupenot-Merme. Here, too, the aromatics take center stage at first glance, while it is the wine’s length and overall balance that hold all of the elements beautifully in place. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028.

2579,Antinori,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Taupenots’ 2008 Charmes Chambertin displays kirsch as well as candied cherry on the nose, which are allied to (or is that pitted against?) tart rhubarb on a bright, firm palate. This is suffused with both chalky and invigoratingly saline mineral manifestations; rose hip, cherry pit, and smoky black tea adding further, piquant complexity that follows into a long, lip-smacking finish. An extreme expression of its cru, it will strike some tasters as too lean, tart, and bitter, but I find it not quite too much of the above three and tonic-like in its fascination and vivacity. 

Romain Taupenot is clearly taking important steps to build on his family’s experience and do justice to their extensive list of appellations in parcels spread out along the Cote d’Or (and in both Pinot and Chardonnay). My tastings of wines from the last three vintages turned up some fine and above all highly distinctive bottlings which, if I were to guess, will probably please some pinotphiles more than my scores might suggest, and please the rest less! Taupenot – who prefers closed fermentors in order, he claims, to prevent influence of the yeasts in one batch on this in another – opined that his raw material in 2008 permitted sparing punch-downs in the early stage of fermentation, whereas he did not trust his 2007 fruit to respond well to as aggressive a regimen of extraction. “You had to be careful not to do too-short maceration in 2008” though, he maintains, “because whereas usually the extraction of tannin in the presence of alcohol is steady, in 2008 the tannin was not extracted until very late.” The 2008s here had been bottled a month before my February visit, all with light filtration, because, Taupenot says, “the levels of turbidity I measured were too high for me to omit filtration, whereas in 2007 I bottled some of the wines without filtration.” This estate is perhaps best known for their few rows of Clos de Lambrays, on account of which that site misses being a monopole of the Domaine des Lambrays; but as I did not have time to taste the entire Taupenot-Merme range, I did not insist on sampling the less-than-barrique-sized quantity of that particular cru.

2580,Antinori,Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru La Riotte,"From a little-known cru sandwiched between Blanchards and Millandes (and a portion of which is in vines the Taupenots planted in 1937) their 2008 Morey-St.-Denis La Riotte displays a density and fine grain of tannin comparable to the corresponding Chambolle Combes d’Orveaux, here with ripe purple plum and dark cherry shadowed by their distilled counterparts and high-toned almond extract, lemon oil, and ginseng. Bright and lithe on the palate, this could use a bit of filling-out – which may well come with time – but even its almost ethereal outline is impressive, and I’d bet on 8-10 years of high performance here.

2581,Antinori,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Bel-Air,"The Taupenot-Merme 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin Bel Air – from that small, intriguing site above Clos de Beze – follows the apparent pattern for the domaine in this vintage by featuring kirsch and plum distillate laced with citrus oil in a high-toned display that some may consider overly volatile but I find entrancing. A mouthful of tart cherry, plum, red currant, and chalk dust seemingly leaves it to the freshly butchered raw meat of the animal that has eaten them to reveal the herbs and flowers one looks for from this sector. (I beg apology for any inadvertent offense to advocates of vegetarianism.) This is admittedly relatively spare, but conveys fascinating complexity and real finishing energy, not to mention sheer refreshment (which admittedly, will not be high on everyone’s list of red wine values). I would anticipate at least 8-10 very active years of life.

2582,Antinori,Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru,"As might correctly be inferred from the existence of a Taupenot family 2008 Mazoyeres-Chambertin – from a large parcel planted in 1959 – their Charmes is all from the true Charmes rather than any of it being from Mazoyeres. Surprisingly at odds with the character of that Charmes, this Mazoyeres displays a very gamey, almost acridly smoky nose – certainly in part a function of reduction, but not one I could shake-off. Medicinal herbs strike a more typical Morey-side note and the sense of meatiness is cleaner on the palate, mingling with herbal concentrate and bitter-edged dark berries and tinged with black pepper, all impressively long-lasting. While anything but winsome, this certainly merits revisiting, and its abundant but fine-grained tannin – not to mention its overall reductive cast – encourage the belief that it will hold up robustly for at least a decade.

2583,Antinori,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru La Combe d'Orveau,"Almost entirely from vines planted in 1942, the Taupenot-Merme 2008 Chambolle-Musigny Combes d’Orveaux displays some of the same prominent tartness that characterized the village-level wines of its collection – and which might have been accentuated by recent bottling – but here there is an impressive sense of density allied to levity; and a sweetness to the tart-edged red currant and cherry fruit – mingled with rose hip, cinnamon ginger, and meat broth – that really convinces. Hints of chalk and cherry pit contribute to a vibrant sense of fruit-mineral-spice interplay in a lip-smacking finish. I would bet on this conspicuously high-elevation, structurally fine-grained Chambolle being worth following for close to a decade.

2584,Antinori,Auxey-Duresses 1er Cru,"Taupenot’s 2008 Auxey Duresses 1er Cru – a blend from his parcels in Duresses and nearby Grands Champs, first essayed in 2007 – offers a fresh dark cherry and plum matrix tinged with the bitterness of their pits and a slightly austere sense of chalkiness. But the combination of density with fine grain, sheer levity, and high-energy brightness easily convinces me that this will be worth following for at least half a dozen years.

2585,Antinori,Morey-Saint-Denis Village,"Taupenot-Merme’s 2008 Morey-St.-Denis – largely from the Les Porroux below Clos de la Bussieres – evinces game; tart purple plum and dark cherry; smoky black tea; and high-toned, medicinal herbal extracts. With firm but in the context of the present collection relatively fine tannins, this finishes with sap and invigoration of a certain austerity thanks to the combination of tartness and bitter herbal notes. I suspect it will tone down in a few years and make for satisfaction until at least age 6. From quite numerous and disparate parcels, the corresponding Gevrey-Chambertin was a bit more high-toned and strident.

Fruit at the Badia a Passignano estate matures very nicely, Marchesi Antinori General Manager Renzo Cotarella tells me. He describes the 2019 season as having abundant rain in the spring and then showing heat that lasted for a good part of the summer. This estate has a total of 56 hectares of vines, but this bottle is born from a selection from 20 hectares. The resulting annual production is 100,000 bottles. The wine offers sweet tannins, lots of dark cherry, spicy sensations, rich fruit weight and hints of salinity on the close.",,RP 91
2589,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"Here's an interesting bit of news. This wine is a blend of fruit from four villages in Chianti Classico. However, those single vineyards will soon be bottled as their own distinct Gran Selezione wines. For now, we have the 2019 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori. This was a productive vintage that resulted in good yields thanks to abundant rainfall at the beginning of the season. The wine's tension and firmness remind me of the classic 2016 vintage, but 2019 ultimately shows more richness and accessibility.

It offers roundness, supple red and purple fruit flavors, balanced spice and freshness. The main theme here is primary fruit and general vitality. The wine philosophy is meant to be an expression of the Antinori brand, and indeed fruit is sourced from across the family holdings in Tuscany. You get terrific value in an easy-drinking red.",,RP 91
2591,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Cont'Ugo,"The Guado al Tasso 2020 Bolgheri Rosso Cont'Ugo is a pure expression of Merlot that has absorbed the ripeness and softness of this hot vintage. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc have a proven track record in these ever-more frequent warm vintages along the Tuscan coast, but early-ripening Merlot can sometimes come off as too ripe and jammy. This wine walks a fine line, and although it never shows excessive softness, you have to wonder how much further it can be pushed in light of climate change. Dark cherry and blackberry preserves cede to cedar and baking spice. The mouthfeel is round, soft and creamy.",,RP 91
2592,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"I've been tracking the increasing percentage of Cabernet Franc in the blend of this iconic Tuscan wine. The 2019 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso is made with 25% Cabernet Franc, with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot. That this heat-resistant grape now makes up a quarter of the blend speaks to how vintners are gearing up to counter climate change. These are intelligent choices, and you can count on this wine to maintain that level of extreme elegance and intensity that it is known for (even when Merlot was a bigger part of the blend). Indeed, this is a new and improved Guado al Tasso with focused aromas of pencil shaving, white pepper and crushed stone that frame a rich core of black fruit. A fluttering of dried mint gives lift and power to the bouquet. This is a beautifully linear and powerful red blend.",,RP 91

This pure expression of Cabernet Franc paints the palate with black fruit, baker's chocolate, pressed rose and fragrant mint. There is plenty of crushed stone and pencil shaving as well. Cabernet Franc is a comfortable protagonist, and the wine delivers power, intensity and depth over an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel.",,RP 91
2594,Antinori,Solaia,"The Marchesi Antinori 2019 Solaia is another blockbuster success from Tuscany's leading wine estate. The blend sees a slightly higher percentage of Cabernet Franc and a slightly lower percentage of Sangiovese. The current mix is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Franc (which has been creeping up in recent years, especially as the climate changes). The soils at the Solaia vineyard are rich in Galestro rock, which is an especially happy pairing with Cabernet Franc in particular. Managing Director Renzo Cotarella tells me that that a vintage like 2019 is proof that the final character of a wine comes from its surrounding territory, not from the blend. This is a generous and extremely expressive edition with lots of dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The tannins are beautifully velvety and soft. This is a beautiful wine that collectors will love.",,RP 91

This is an elegant and extremely polished wine made with mostly Sangiovese and smaller parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Here too, the small blending element of Cabernet Franc has been slowly increasing in recent years. The 2019 vintage was born with a good amount of power and tannic structure, and maceration times were slightly reduced as a result. This less extractive approach shapes a polished and elegant wine with plenty of bright berry fruit, cherry, dried mint, blue flower, blood orange and rusty earth. The palate is more compact and streamlined. It shows beautiful grace. After this, the next vintage to watch is the highly anticipated 2021.",,RP 91

This accessible blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah offers tight mineral notes, toasted spice, almond and lots of dark, luscious fruit. To the palate, the wine exhibits softly caressing tannins",,RP 91
2597,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"This popular wine is currently sold out, but because of a shipping mistake I am only able to offer a review now. I have included a preview of the upcoming 2020 vintage to make up for the mistake. The Guado al Tasso 2019 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato boasts generous fruit weight with layers of dark cherry, ripe blackberry, tobacco, spice and baker's chocolate. The tannins are plush and soft, and ultimately, it is the supple mouthfeel that gives this wine its mass appeal and exceedingly easy-drinking personality.",,RP 91
2598,Antinori,Solaia,"The Marchesi Antinori 2018 Solaia reveals a silky and elegant personality, and the wine steps away from some of the more robust fruit weight and dark concentration that we've seen in the past. This elegant vintage prizes fruit purity and focus with black plum, cassis, blue flower, pencil shaving and lots of sweet spice from the oak that recalls clove and toasted almond. The blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller parts Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. The fruit is harvested at the Antinori family's Tenuta Tignanello at the heart of the Chianti Classico appellation. The percentage of Cabernet Franc used in the blend is the ultimate Solaia wild card. In this vintage, the Franc has been increased to 7%, and that number is expected to be even higher in 2019 as the vines get older and the fruit more complex. Production of Solaia is 65,000 bottles in this vintage. This is a beautiful wine, but if pressed I must admit a preference for the 2018 Tignanello (the other celebrated wine crafted at this property). The 2018 Solaia is delicious on all fronts as expected, but the 2018 Tignanello struck at my heart strings. Either way, these are stunning results.",,RP 91
2599,Antinori,Chianti Classico Pèppoli,"The Marchesi Antinori 2019 Chianti Classico Pèppoli shows bright fruit and dried cherry with some nutty tones of toasted hazelnut at the back. This is a famously simple and streamlined wine with mid-weight appeal and good acidity. It is the proverbial Italian pasta wine, whether it be a carbonara or amatriciana. The wine ages in a combination of large Slavonian oak, barrique and stainless steel vat. Production is a huge 834,000 bottles.",,RP 91
2600,Antinori,Tignanello,"This wine brought to mind precise imagery of tailcoats, striped dress pants, wingtip collar shirts and other gentlemen's fashion choices from the Roaring Twenties. Sporting a retro but classic personality, the Marchesi Antinori 2018 Tignanello is quite the dapper and jovial wine that hits the market just as much of the world is emerging from a dark chapter of lockdowns and coronavirus curfews. I love the optimism that springs bright with such clarity and detail from within this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The 2016 vintage was a benchmark for sure, but I prefer the 2018, thanks to that tinge of nostalgia or emotion that is so deftly rendered in this cool, long growing season. 

The 2018 vintage offers a deconstructed Tignanello upon first inspection because you can clearly make out the varietal typicity of the grapes, especially the green spice and white pepper of the two Cabernets, along with aromas of crushed limestone that recall the white rocks carefully placed in the vineyards to protect the rows. The wine's fruit weight is contained and polished, and there are no exaggerations, excesses or loose ends. The results are calculated and exacting, especially if you consider the tannic management (with aging in both new and used Hungarian and French oak for up to 16 months) and the quality of the elegant mouthfeel. With time in the glass, those deconstructed elements converge to create unity and balance. The Tignanello vineyard is 57 hectares and sits at a breezy 390 meters above sea level with alberese and galestro soils. Those elevations proved important for shedding excess humidity at the end of this 2018 growing season. Production for this excellent wine is an impressive 345,000 bottles.",,RP 91
2601,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"Renzo Cotarella, managing director of Marchesi Antinori tells me that the 2018 vintage showed very different results in the inland and hilly Chianti Classico appellation compared to the flat, sea-facing Bolgheri appellation. This season saw some rain right before harvest. That extra humidity rolled right off the Chianti Classico hills and disappeared without effect, but it stuck around longer in the thicker, flatter soils of Guado al Tasso. For this reason, one of the estate's top wines, the Cabernet Franc-based Matarocchio, was not produced in 2018 for fear that the fruit would not offer the concentration required of a wine of that important stature. The best of that fruit was used in this wine instead. For that reason, the 2018 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso sees a little more Cabernet Franc (clocking in at about 22% of the blend) and less Merlot, with the rest being Cabernet Sauvignon, of course, (at about 60%). 

To be honest, the percentage of Cabernet Franc has been deliberately creeping up over the years to render a more focused and sharper bouquet. Aromas of dark fruit and freshly milled white pepper replace the more banal cherry-based flavors delivered by the Merlot, and the wine appears more lifted and precise as a result. The Cabernet Sauvignon delivers spice and licorice, and these pretty aromas are likewise given more breathing room, thanks to the counterparts found in the Cabernet Franc. Linearity, sharpness, pencil shavings and dark currant or blackberry—this is the direction Guado al Tasso is taking, and this 2018 vintage opens the door to a new chapter for the wine. Some 115,000 bottles were made.",,RP 91
2602,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori,"This wine is made exclusively with fruit from the gorgeous Tenuta Tignanello in San Casciano Val di Pesa (home to its namesake wine Tignanello, and Solaia) and sees mostly Sangiovese blended with a smaller part Cabernet Sauvignon and other complementary grapes. The Marchesi Antinori 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori vaunts a smooth and silky personality with ample berry definition and brightness. The previous 2017 vintage revealed more black and purple fruits because of the scorching hot and dry summer that year, but this wine from the cooler 2018 growing season focuses on red raspberry and cherry instead. That fruit is framed by light spice (from Hungarian and French oak) and licorice. Some 273,000 bottles were produced.",,RP 91
2603,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"This wine sources its fruit from across the Chianti Classico appellation, as Marchesi Antinori has access to parcels throughout the various comuni represented. The 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori opens to a sweet note of summer cherry and wild plum that is so characteristic of Sangiovese. The wine is shapely and soft with some distant oak spice, blue flower and potting soil. A small part of Merlot is blended in to add that extra plushness that I have described. Production is an ample 378,000 bottles.",,RP 91
2604,Antinori,Villa Antinori,This informal wine is based on Sangiovese but has other complementary red grapes in the blend and sees its fruit sourced from various parts of Tuscany. The 2018 Villa Antinori shows some ripeness and sweetness with an accessible and open-knit quality of fruit. The wine's aromas of dark cherry and blackberry would stand up nicely to a classic Tuscan dish of pappardelle al ragù di cinghiale (ribbon pasta with wild boar sauce) thanks to the natural acidity and freshness inherent to this wine. Production is three million bottles.,,RP 91
2605,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"This entry-level red is made with fruit sourced from across the region of Tuscany, and what is used here consequently serves to reduce yields in preparation for Marchesi Antinori's more expensive wines. The 2017 Villa Antinori is not a declared or fixed blend, but past vintages have consisted of mostly Sangiovese with smaller parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and other red grapes. Everything is fermented in stainless steel, and the wine is aged briefly in French, Hungarian and Californian oak. This vintage saw rich and concentrated fruit by harvest time, and you taste that extra extraction here with plumy dark fruit, sweet blackberry and candied almond. The wine is plush, sweet and pleasantly fruit-driven. I would suggest drinking it within the next year or two while that dark fruit is most vibrant. Production was down in this vintage with 1,360,000 bottles released in March 2020.",,RP 88
2606,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne was tasted (after a double decant) among the other wines from the Chianti Classico appellation made by Marchesi Antinori. That's a change because I usually taste this wine in a peer group of fellow Brunelli. You'd be forgiven for forgetting how different Sangiovese from these two geographically close (but philosophically distant) wine regions ultimately tastes. This expression from the warm 2015 vintage is loosely knit and less fine-tuned. It offers a broad-brush interpretation of the grape, with textured blackberry, spice, tar and earthy aromas. There is a touch of heat or extra ripeness in this wine that tends to flatten out the more nuanced details of the grape. The wine feels a bit evolved even at this young tasting date. Some 172,000 bottles were released in January 2020.",,RP 88
2607,Antinori,Chianti Classico Pèppoli,"The 2017 Chianti Classico Pèppoli withstands the heat of the vintage relatively unscathed, with bright berry fruit, blue flower, potting soil and wild herb. The wine offers good freshness, an easy-drinking style and the wild cherry flavors to pair with a heaping burger and fries.",,RP 88
2608,Antinori,Solaia,"I fussed over scoring this wine more than I'd like to admit—tasting through three samples under different conditions at various intervals and testing my impressions blind against wines in its peer group. Most importantly, I tasted this 2016 vintage against the 2015 vintage over and over again. I confess to a few nights of restless sleep as a result. Ultimately, my decision to award 100 points to the 2016 Solaia came on impulse and with the most natural sense of purpose. I had also given the 2015 vintage a perfect score, and intellectually, it seemed impossible not to pick a favorite among these two stunning expressions. I will also state, outright, that the wines are very different, principally because the 2015 vintage shows more overall opulence and sweetness that extends to the pronounced textural richness of the mouthfeel. The 2016 vintage, on the other hand, is more chiseled and sharp with mineral shadings of campfire ash and graphite at the rim of its dark fruit. The mouthfeel is more streamlined and tight at its core, suggesting that the wine will unfold and soften beautifully with time. I feel like 2015 is the Dolce & Gabbana of the situation and the 2016 is the Armani Privé. The personalities of the two wines are distinct, yet my admiration for each is identical.",,RP 88
2609,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"Badia a Passignano is one of the last vineyards to mature and one of the first to start, so it always has a very long growing cycle. The spring began with good weather with budbreak coming about ten days early, followed by a cool, early summer and a hot August. The Sangiovese-based 2016 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano shows some real ripeness on the close with more red and purple fruit rather than black fruit characteristics. This is a very traditional expression of the Tuscan grape and the least international of Marchesi Antinori's offerings. It's the kind of classic Sangiovese that belongs on the table next to a pappardelle with your favorite ragù.",,RP 88
2610,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori,"The 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori is Sangiovese enhanced with touches of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Renzo Cotarella and the extended technical team at Marchesi Antinori are working hard on perfecting their tannin management, and the beautiful results are evident across this line of new releases from the classic 2016 vintage. The finish is silky and long, and the tannins are never dry. The fruit is evident and bright with wild cherry, rose and Italian garden herb.",,RP 88
2611,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"The 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori (made with Sangiovese and a tiny bit of Merlot to soften out the edges) is a linear and broad red wine that would pair with simple meat or pasta dishes. You get tons of fruit here with cherry, blackberry and a touch of soft baking spice woven in on the close. This pretty vintage is focused and sharp in character.",,RP 88
2612,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"Here is a tempting wine to pair with your favorite lasagna or ravioli dish. The 2016 Villa Antinori is made with red grapes sourced in various parts of Tuscany and production is a staggering 3.6 million bottles per year (300,000 12-bottle cases). All the kinks have been worked out in this value wine, and you can count on fresh fruit flavors backed by light spice and leather.",,RP 88
2613,Antinori,Franciacorta Brut Riserva Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Contessa Maggia,"This Franciacorta sparkling wine shows some age and a slightly more full-bodied approach (compared to past vintages) with good volume and creaminess. However, it ultimately holds back, so it never feels heavy. The wine is layered and sophisticated in approach, allowing for a pairing with smoked salmon pâté. The 2011 Franciacorta Brut Riserva Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Contessa Maggia shows good volume, structure and overall beading.",,RP 88
2614,Antinori,Tignanello,"To hit the market in June, the 2016 Tignanello is a rock-solid wine and a stunning beauty. The wine offers an impeccable level of precision and laser-focus delivery of fruits, spices, tilled earth, espresso beans and Mediterranean herbs. This vintage follows the classic blending formula of 80% Sangiovese with about 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Cabernet Franc. The vines are now 15 to 20 years old. Compared to the 2015 vintage that ultimately appeared more chewy and succulent, this expression from the iconic 2016 vintage is more vibrant, nervous and jazzed. It shows more savory spice, saltiness and minerality, with a beautifully integrated quality of tannins. Some 320,000 bottles were produced. This wine is at the top of the list of some of the best Tignanello ever made, including the vintages 2007, 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015.",,RP 88
2615,Antinori,Vermentino Guado al Tasso,"This terrific, easy-drinking white wine is versatile and bright. The 2018 Bolgheri Vermentino shows the green papaya and lime aromas that are characteristic of the grape, along with salty mineral notes that recall the beach-front vineyards of Bolgheri. The finish is snappy and cooling.",,RP 88
2616,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosato Guado al Tasso Scalabrone,"This is a very popular Rosato you often see served at the beach-side resorts of Coastal Tuscany. The 2018 Bolgheri Rosato Scalabrone opens to a bright pink raspberry color and shows easy berry aromas backed by mint and almond. The blend of grapes used is Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. There is a touch of sun-kissed sweetness on the close.",,RP 88
2617,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"This is another extremely popular wine that is easily found up and down the Tuscan Coast. This red blend (with the largest part of the blend going to Cabernet Sauvignon) opens to a soft and velvety texture. The 2017 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato offers some noticeable ripeness with black cherry, prune and raisin. But ultimately, the wine shows a good level of freshness because the acidity in the grapes was concentrated (like everything else in this hot vintage) in the year’s smaller berries. Tenuta Guado al Tasso extends over 340 hectares. Because of the hot vintage, only 65,000 cases were made of this wine instead of the 100,000 cases produced in a normal vintage.",,RP 88
2618,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"This stunning vintage of this landmark wine marks a slight adjustment to the blend. The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso is no longer made with Petit Verdot. The blend is now 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and now 20% Cabernet Franc. This small change does not go unnoticed, as this wine is absolutely seamless now—like the finest Asian silk fabric. That profound textural softness and suppleness changes the way the wine smells and tastes, with hints of momentary sweetness that are more tactile than anything else. Generally speaking, the 2016 vintage offers more elegance (slightly less concentration) and a hair more freshness compared to the 2015 edition. When I tasted this wine, the bouquet was still timid, but it will no doubt become more expressive and open as this beautiful wine continues forward along its aging trajectory. Some 120,000 bottles were made, a remarkable feat considering the extreme quality on offer.",,RP 88
2619,Antinori,Guado al Tasso Matarocchio,"The 2016 Matarocchio is a wine of muscle and brawn that opens to dark thickness and deep layers of black fruit, spice, leather and tar. If you like big and bold, this Tuscan Cabernet Franc will prove quite agile when pairing with coal-fired barbecued T-bone steak. This wine was produced in 2017, but it was not made in 2018 because the variety had a hard time reaching optimal ripeness. This full-bodied wine is absolutely linear and direct in terms of aromas; however, it shows fleshy succulence in terms of mouthfeel. It closes with midnight black notes of dried berry and exotic spice.",,RP 88
2620,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Cont'Ugo,"A pure expression of Merlot, the 2016 Bolgheri Rosso Cont'Ugo is a ripe and loosely knit red wine that would wash down nicely with easy pasta dishes. The wine shows the rich softness of the grape with black cherry, tilled earth and Mediterranean herb. The wine is immediately open and accessible. Some 60,000 bottles were produced, and this vintage is a step ahead of the previous editions. You can't go wrong with this informal and generous Tuscan red.",,RP 88
2621,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2014 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne works very nicely all said and done. It presents the light and undertone character of the vintage against the ripe and more opulent style that is associated with this vineyard site at the lower parts of southern Montalcino. These two elements result in a balanced and forthright performance. The wine opens to a dark garnet color and ripe aromas of dark cherry and blackberry followed by potting soil, rose bud and grilled herb. Some 150,000 bottles were made.",,RP 88
2622,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia,"This wine reaches into the deep end of the Brunello intensity spectrum. The 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia is a compact and robust expression of Sangiovese that presents a thick core of dark fruit followed by savory tones of tobacco, spice and cured leather. You might mistakenly conclude that this vintage offers a more international interpretation of Montalcino (with 30 months of oak aging), but I don't necessarily believe this to be the case. The wine is instead accurately reflective of Sangiovese with more textural richness, sunshine and structure locked within. This Riserva embodies a sense of place more than it does winemaking style. Some 13,200 bottles were made.",,RP 88
2623,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"This is absolutely one of the best value wines you will find in Italy and I suspect beyond. The 2016 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah. With more than one million bottles made, there should be no problem finding it at your nearest wine merchant. Once you do locate it, I enthusiastically recommend that you pick up a few cases. This vintage comes together with seamless intensity and smoothness. You get so much dark fruit flavor, paired with soft tannins, spice, smoke and dried blackberry. Il Bruciato pulls off its magic effortlessly. It doesn't try to be anything other than it is: Delicious.",,RP 88
2624,Antinori,Rosso di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"With fruit from an excellent harvest in Montalcino, the 2016 Rosso di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne is an immediately attractive wine that flaunts fresh and balanced fruit intensity. Red cherries, dried blueberries and wild strawberries underline the wine's pretty primary characteristics. Sangiovese is picked from 10- to 12-year-old vines, and the vineyard site is registered for the production of Rosso di Montalcino (in other words, this is not leftover fruit from a Brunello vineyard). This gives the Pian delle Vigne team a greater opportunity to work on the sharp focus and accessibility of the wine. Drink this wine within the next five years.",,RP 88
2625,Antinori,Chianti Classico Pèppoli,"Here's a fun, zippy wine to enjoy with pizza or pasta at your local trattoria. The 2016 Chianti Classico Pèppoli is a lean red wine with the fresh aromas of cassis, cranberry, blue violet and grilled herb that are characteristic of Sangiovese. This wine shows easy purity with a light, garnet color. The acidity is glossy and bright. Pèppoli is a bit closed at the moment, but it awakens quickly with a few swirls of the glass.",,RP 88
2626,Antinori,Solaia,"There is a magical infinity, a continuous loop of compatibilities, between the icon wines of Tuscany and the 2015 vintage. The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published. Some 80,000 bottles were produced.",,RP 88
2627,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"The 2015 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso is another star performer from a vintage that was tailor-made by some higher being specifically for the blended red wines of Tuscany. This mix of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot slides seamlessly right in there with our highest expectations of the iconic vintage. The wine offers beautiful intensity and purity, yet it also delivers balanced power and lasting persistence. This is a baritone expression from Bolgheri on the Tuscan coast with impenetrable black fruit, chocolate and tobacco followed by rich concentration and tightly knit texture. I tasted this wine next to a barrel sample of the unfinished 2016 vintage. This vintage appears more exuberant and opulent at this early stage. Some 120,000 bottles were made.",,RP 88
2628,Antinori,Guado al Tasso Matarocchio,"The 2015 Matarocchio (all Cabernet Franc) is a gorgeous wine, but it does not reach the stunning heights achieved in the knock-out 2013 vintage. This wine was not produced in 2014, and only 5,000 bottles were made in this vintage. Compared to the 2013 edition, this wine appears to have a slightly smaller aromatic range. This gives it a very focused and direct approach. In other words, this vintage is more vertical than it is horizontal in its delivery. The tannins are a more evident here and more nervous or crunchy. The wine is composed of deep, dark and penetrating fruit, with bitter chocolate and savory tobacco. It also shows a salty mineral note that makes your mouth salivate. This vintage of Matarocchio needs a few more years of bottle aging to gain in volume.",,RP 88
2629,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 2015 Tignanello is a wine that opens, like a fully blossomed rose, right in front of you. This vintage is immediately accessible, generous and opulent. The wine will surely flesh out and gain focus with more bottle age, but one of the best qualities of this vintage is just how beautiful the wine tastes straight out of the gate. The fruit is beautifully ripe with fresh blackberry and cherry nuances, spice, leather, sweet tobacco and smoke. Up until this vintage, the various blending components that make up Tignanello were vinifed in separate lots. Starting with 2015, the wine is blended sooner in order to achieve better overall integration. The entire Tignanello estate counts 130 hectares of vines, but the single-vineyard ""Tignanello"" that makes this wine is 57 hectares. Some 340,000 bottles were produced.",,RP 88
2630,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"The 2015 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano is a pure expression of Sangiovese. Fruit is sourced from the San Donato area of the appellation that is not an official subzone yet but is increasingly emerging as such. This wine is distinguished by a beautiful level of openness and softness (on the Sangiovese spectrum, which means you also get a bright dose of acidity). That softness or lushness comes in part due to the warm vintage but also thanks to the winemaking approach that relies on larger barrels (from 300 to 500 liters) and Hungarian oak that tends to be more porous and thickly textured for increased passage of oxygen. The wine offers beautiful balance between its dark fruit and savory spice comments. This Chianti Classico Gran Selezione was not produced in 2014.",,RP 88
2631,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori,"The 2015 Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori is Sangiovese sourced from across the 130-hectare Tignanello estate with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot added to the blend. Only 20% of the wine is aged in new oak (barrique and tonneaux from France and Hungary), while the rest goes into neutral barrels. What stands out first is the soft or fleshy nature of the tannins. They are sweet, yet the wine is held together with firm grip and backbone. The aromas are vibrant and dark with mature fruit followed by fragrant rose hip, forest berry and chalky mineral.",,RP 88
2632,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"The 2015 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori sees fruit sourced from different sites across the appellation. It is almost all Sangiovese with a tiny percentage of Merlot to flesh it out or give it thicker contours. This wine was not produced in 2014. It was first introduced in 2011, so this is only the fourth vintage of its existence. The bouquet delivers round and supple fruit tones with blackberry and summer cherry at the front. You then get that signature crunchiness or freshness that is derived from the acidity found in Sangiovese. However, the finish is not sharp. This wine ends with soft, velvety tannins. You get very good value here.",,RP 88
2633,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"With more than three million bottles produced, the 2015 Villa Antinori is easy to find, affordable and easy drinking. Fruit comes from various parts of Tuscany (not one specific zone), and the blend is mostly Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot thrown in. A fraction of the wine is aged in new oak, and the rest is put into neutral barrel. What more can you say? This is precisely the kind of wine you'll want to pick up for outdoor barbecues or pizza night in front of the television. It offers freshness with abundant sweet fruit.",,RP 88
2634,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne shows a level of increased volume and texture that appears less frequently in its peers. This wine has always marched to its own drumbeat, and this newest release is no exception. A warmer microclimate characterizes the spot where these vineyards are located, and the fruit is opulent, ripe and exuberant as a result. The Antinori house style also comes through, and the wine has a more contemporary or international outlook as a result. What I really want to say is that Pian delle Vigne shows great results in this vintage. The Pian is back.",,RP 88
2635,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia,"I can just smell all the thought and hard work that evidently went into making the 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia. This wine is the fruit of important discussions, contemplation and decision-making. I say that because I know how challenging the 2012 vintage was for people who farm Sangiovese. That effort has paid off handsomely because this is a complete and layered wine that makes a careful presentation of bold primary fruit that segues to secondary aromas of spice and tobacco. Generally speaking, I like the 2013 vintage far better than 2012, but this wine has pulled itself forward to earn a high score, thanks to its sheer willpower and determination.",,RP 88
2636,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Cont'Ugo,"The 2015 Bolgheri Rosso Cont'Ugo is a soft and luscious Merlot from the Tuscan Coast. The wine is generous and bright, showing the full range of cherry and dark fruit exuberance you can expect of this grape in a sunny and warm vintage like 2015. The wine offers lovely softness and fruity sweetness that wraps thickly over the palate. You'd do well to pair this bright Tuscan red with grilled meats or oven-roasted lasagna. The mid-weight finish is bright and moderate length. This wine offers broad-based appeal.",,RP 88
2637,Antinori,Chianti Classico Pèppoli,"The 2015 Chianti Classico Pèppoli is a steady and even wine. It shows the basic qualities you look for in an easy-drinking Chianti Classico without the extra bells and whistles you get in the more expensive categories. The wine is fresh, bright and lean in terms of mouthfeel. It offers fresh notes of dark cherry and blackberry. Drink this no-fuss red within the next two years.",,RP 88
2638,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello,The 2014 Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello offers good depth and fruity intensity that immediately emerges from the bouquet. This is a complete and likable wine that will pair with grilled steak or roasted potatoes with garlic. You need those savory and salty flavors to counter the fruity succulence and fresh acidity delivered here.,,RP 88
2639,Antinori,Franciacorta Brut Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Conte Aimo Blanc de Noir,"The 2009 Franciacorta Brut Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Conte Aimo Blanc de Noir is a medium to full-bodied expression with tonic layers of citrus, wild sage, grapefruit and crushed mineral. This pretty wine offers deep complexity and texture. The wine moves over the palate with silky texture and fine perlage. It also fills the mouth with its generous layering and dimension.",,RP 88
2640,Antinori,Franciacorta Brut Riserva Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Contessa Maggia,"The 2007 Franciacorta Brut Riserva Marchese Antinori Tenuta Montenisa Contessa Maggia is a tonic and fresh sparkling wine. It opens to delicate aromas of white peach, yellow rose and mildly toasted almond. If offers a deep feeling of sophistication and attention, but does so in a very easy and almost nonchalant manner. Yeasty notes of baked bread and croissant give the wine depth and density.",,RP 88
2641,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2015 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato is already on the market and continues to enjoy great success thanks to its compelling quality to price ratio. The 2015 vintage delivers incredibly balanced results thanks to weather patterns that were never too hot or too cold. The wine opens to dark fruit aromas with black cherry, spice and mocha. The tannins are sweet, but the wine finishes with elegant dryness. This is exactly the kind of wine you should buy by the case, so that you always have a bottle handy for spontaneous dinner parties.",,RP 88
2642,Antinori,Solaia,"The 2014 Solaia will be released during the second half of 2017. This is a fine-tuned expression that shows a focused sense of detail and careful attention. The quota of Cabernet Franc has been upped by a hair and this makes a big difference, especially in terms of the wine's bouquet. Otherwise, this celebrated Tuscan blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. It opens to dark fruit aromas with crushed mineral, pipe tobacco, pressed flower and toasted spice. Its appearance is midnight black and profound. The wine delivers a sense of sheer excitement and nervousness that will subside with another few years of bottle age. Nonetheless, I think a certain amount of that bright edginess or rigidness will always be part of this cool vintage Solaia. In the mouth, the wine is firm, compact and dense. The tannins are chiseled to the point of sublime integration. Marchesi Antinori made 40% less Solaia in this vintage in order to maintain the quality you taste here.",,RP 88
2643,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"The 2014 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso offers more excellent surprises from this underdog vintage. Its deep, velvety color stands out first. This is an immensely soft and smooth red blend from the Bolgheri area on the Tuscan Coast. The wine opens to dark fruit aromas with background notes of spice, sweet tobacco and dark cacao. The tannins are refined and smooth with succulent end notes of ripe fruit and blackberry. The wine's texture is thicker and more elaborate than you might initially suspect. In fact, very little here indicates that 2014 was a cold and difficult vintage. Due to severe fruit selection, production of this wine is down by 30%.",,RP 88
2644,Antinori,Tignanello,"Tignanello has this amazing ability of always being, well, Tignanello. Its very DNA makes it among the most distinctive and recognizable wines in the world. I'm happy to report that this is also the case for the 2014 Tignanello that faced very different growing conditions compared to most. The wine is beautiful and balanced with sweet tannins and a supporting oak texture that is neatly folded at the back. The wine is all about measure and proportion, and it aspires to these goals with an impressive sense of natural harmony. This is not an overtly powerful or muscular expression. Instead, it shows a tasty, almost savory form of elegance. This vintage was made with 75% Sangiovese, which means that the Cabernet presence is a tad bigger than normal. Ultimately, this wine is more finessed and delicate, and I appreciate the careful tannic management on display here.",,RP 88
2645,Antinori,Guado al Tasso Matarocchio,"The 2013 Matarocchio is perhaps the most stunning wine I have yet tasted from the prolific portfolio of Italy's most important producer: Marchesi Antinori. This pure expression of Cabernet Franc comes from the family's Bolgheri estate Tenuta Guado al Tasso. I tasted the wine after it had been in bottle for 18 months. It is set to be released in September and less than 4,000 bottles were produced. Matarocchio was not made in 2014. Cabernet Franc is quickly becoming a headline grape along the Tuscan Coast, and this beautiful creation builds a rock-solid case for that claim. The bouquet is deep and penetrating with delicious and succulent aromatic layers that peel back in slow succession. Blackberry and dark currant is followed by tar, licorice, leather and delicate mineral tones that resemble polished river stone. There is spice, pepper and sweet clove. The best part, however, is the elegance and veritable lightness shown in the mouth. The wine is indeed structured and richly concentrated, but it feels so much lighter on its feet compared to the bulkier 2011 vintage that I tasted alongside for comparison. The wine's drinking window will remain wide open for many more years.",,RP 88
2646,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"The Antinori family is intent on carving out a distinct identity for its Badia a Passignano estate. Fruit from this stunning spot was first made into a Chianti Classico Riserva. Since the Gran Selezione category was created, they decided to use this single vineyard for the appellation's highest category wine. The 2012 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano is the latest incarnation of this elite category. The wine was produced in 2010 and in 2011, but those two vintages were sold together. This 2012 edition represents a new start. The wine reveals less alcohol compared to 2011 and a more vibrant sense of acidity. It shows more color density as well, with some dark garnet and amber. Although I like this vintage more than the previous release, I feel that more can still be done to fine-tune the results. Badia a Passignano counts 50 hectares of vines, of which 30 hectares have vines aged up to 20 years old planted in deep soils. This site is harvested after Tignanello because cooler conditions make for a longer growing season. Yet, Badia a Passignano results in a more approachable wine with sweet tannins and bright fruit flavors. All the elements for a great Chianti Classico are here, but they are portrayed with more general simplicity. This wine was not made in 2014.",,RP 88
2647,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,Marchesi Antinori's 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne shows some of the jammy fruit and strawberry confit aromas that I have noticed in past vintages. This was a hot growing season as was 2011. The Pian delle Vigne property on the lower slopes of the Brunello appellation seem to be very susceptible to hot vintages and this is made evident here. The mouthfeel is slimmed down and rather simple in presentation. This Brunello is best consumed in the short term.,,RP 88
2648,Antinori,Solaia,"The best vintages of Solaia are 1990, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010 and now 2013. Marchesi Antinori's 2013 Solaia is a profound and meaningful wine that is based mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc in supporting roles. It sports a dark and thick texture with plump fruit and spice, grilled herb and black pepper. The bouquet is intense and layered with the kind of complexity that is best admired as the wine shifts and evolves in the glass. The textual impact is also impressive—you feel the inherent power and the structure, but these elements are never overdone. The best is yet to come; this Solaia is built for long cellar aging.",,RP 88
2649,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 2013 Tignanello represents the beginning of a new chapter for Italy's ultimate game-changer wine. The blend remains 80% Sangiovese with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc but Renzo Cotarella tells me ""stylistically-speaking, this is what we wanted to achieve."" The winemaking formula remains the same, but one of the major differences and benefits to this wine is vineyard age. The celebrated Tignanello single vineyard is now reaching 15 years old. In other words, it is in its production prime. This is a harmonious and beautifully integrated wine that reveals black fruit and baking spice. I'm told the 2014 Tignanello will have a greater percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon and the 2015 vintage will have more Sangiovese.",,RP 88
2650,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"Based in an authentic sense of territory, the 2013 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori is 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot - although Renzo Cotarella tells me that the goal is to soon make this wine 100% Sangiovese. The bouquet is generous and nicely concentrated with dark fruit nuances and succulent spice at the back. Delicate floral nuances of wild rose and violets are given ample room for expression. The mouthfeel is velvety and fine in texture.",,RP 88
2651,Antinori,Chianti Classico Pèppoli,"I admit to having consumed a couple of bottles of the 2014 Chianti Classico Pèppoli after work during my two-week stay in Tuscany. This is one of those ""why not?"" no-brainer Tuscan reds that pairs with basically everything you see on the menu and does a great job of keeping your palate refreshed. If you need a wine that will not be the protagonist against the food you eat, this is your bottle. The 2014 vintage is full of wild berry, pressed rose and light herbal back notes.",,RP 88
2652,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello,"A relatively new addition to the Marchesi Antinori portfolio, this wine really begins to show its potential in this classic vintage. The 2013 Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello is mostly Sangiovese with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The addition of this French grape (harvested from the outstanding Tignanello property) makes all the difference. It catapults the wine into a whole new sphere of density and complexity. In fact, you will recognize that familiar touch of tannic crunchiness and those defined, but slightly austere blackberry aromas. The wine boasts beautiful ripeness and this is most evident in the mouthfeel, where the wine is structured yet seamless. This Chianti Classico Riserva shows superior detail and definition.",,RP 88
2653,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"Here is one of Marchesi Antinori's battleship red wines. The 2013 Villa Antinori is among the estate's most accessible wines with some 200,000 cases (of 12 bottles each) produced in this vintage. The wine is a blend of Sangiovese fruit sourced from various points in Tuscany (Chianti Classico, Maremma and Bolgheri) with other red grapes. Indeed, this wine serves as testament to the various levels of dry extract and ripeness that can be achieved with Sangiovese depending on where it is planted. What this wine offers most of all is impressive consistency throughout each new vintage released.",,RP 88
2654,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"The 2011 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano shows some wear and tear of the vintage heat with dark fruit aromas and jammy nuances of blackberry preserves and cherry marmalade. The wine is 100% Sangiovese and it does present those sassy and slightly spicy aromas that you get with top-notch Chianti Classico. The Badia a Passignano property tends to make sweet and more succulent wines. This is definitely the case here, although you also get more simplicity. I would suggest a near to medium-term drinking window.",,RP 88
2655,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2014 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato tastes like a wine from a much warmer vintage - not the soggy and difficult 2014 vintage that had winemakers so worried. This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah (aged in oak for seven months) shows dark fruit and spice with good intensity and integration. The mouthfeel might be a bit shorter and quick to fade, but this is a solid drinking wine that I happily recommend. Some 800,000 bottles are produced.",,RP 88
2656,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"This is a fantastic wine. The 2013 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso reveals soaring aromas of dark fruit, plum, blackberry, savory spice, tobacco and leather. The results are seamless, harmonious and generous in intensity. This is the quintessential red blend from Coastal Tuscany (made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot) and the 2013 vintage is particularly rooted in a profound sense of place. I am reminded of the macchia mediterranea, or Mediterranean shrub, that grows so wild and free in this relatively untouched part of Tuscany. This is an excellent wine that shows its winemaking pedigree, but make no mistake: It is a proud Tuscan at heart. Some 140,000 bottles are produced (which is pretty amazing considering the quality).",,RP 88
2657,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2011 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne is a ripe and fruit-forward expression of Sangiovese from a warm vintage. The bouquet is very opulent and generous as a result with bold cherry, strawberry, candied raspberry and red currant. There is a little less complexity in this vintage, as Sangiovese is sensitive to summer heat. This Brunello shows a soft and smooth quality of tannins with medium persistence. I feel that Pian delle Vigne doesn't give the best of itself in this vintage. ",,RP 88
2658,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia,"Here's a wine that opens to a beautifully dark and bold appearance. The 2010 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Pian delle Vigne Vignaferrovia sees fruit sourced from a slightly higher altitude compared to the Brunello annata. As a result, you get more definition and sharpness here. This Brunello shows a great level of depth and structure with soft lines, a rich texture and general opulence. The wine is aged in small barrel and sees a second phase of aging in larger oak casks. ",,RP 88
2659,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"Of the wines in this flight, the 2001 Bolgheri Guado al Tasso gave the most immediate pleasure. This wine is seductive, supple and soft thanks to its dark cherry, ripe fruit, exotic spice, cassis, grilled herb, crushed mineral and sweet chewing tobacco. The blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (with smaller parts Merlot and Syrah). It shows integrity, conservation and purity. In fact, this edition of Guado al Tasso tastes a bit younger than it really is. There's nothing to not like here. The quality of fruit is forceful but pristine, and the mouthfeel is nicely layered and long in length. In the greater scheme of things, Antinori's landmark wine is slightly less complex than some of the great wines also presented at this Masterclass--but that gap is minimal. This is an impressive wine and if you have bottles in your cellar, you can count on it to award great pleasure and overall satisfaction.",,RP 88
2660,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosato Guado al Tasso Gherardo,"If you are a Rosé fanatic, the 2013 Bolgheri Rosato Gherardo is an utter beauty. This wine presents the pale pink color, the subtle berry aromas and the crisp acidity of the best Provençal wines. The approach is tempered and streamlined but the wine shows the potential of Italian Rosato. Cassis, raspberry and bitter almond all play supporting roles.",,RP 88
2661,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2013 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. The wine offers red earth nuances with pressed violet, terra-cotta, leather and tobacco. Il Bruciato makes a smooth and silky entry to the palate and imparts more luscious fruit flavors along the way. This wine was first produced in 2002.",,RP 88
2662,Antinori,Vermentino Guado al Tasso Camillo 11 Ottobre,"Marchesi Antinori's 2013 Bolgheri Vermentino Camillo 11 Ottobre is a tonic and crisp white wine with buoyant aromas of citrus, stone fruit, blanched almond and grilled herb. This expression offers a great sense of linearity and mineral definition in the mouth. On the finish, you sense crushed mineral and flint. The effect is well composed and beautifully pristine.",,RP 88
2663,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Cont'Ugo,"The 2013 Bolgheri Rosso Cont'Ugo is an easy-drinking expression of Merlot with bright berry and cherry aromas that emerge first from the bouquet. On second nose, the wine shows spice and dried tobacco leaf. All said and done, this is a fantastic wine to pair with oven-roasted pasta or grilled meat dishes.",,RP 88
2664,Antinori,Solaia,"The 2012 Solaia is the ultimate comfort wine: It serves as a beautiful monument to the potential of Italian wine. Let me give you some context. My lukewarm review of the 2011 vintage caused some heads to turn. Happily, the previous vintage has served as a springboard for this current release. Both 2011 and 2012 come from hot climatic conditions, but these wines are very different in style and content. The 2011 heat softened the lines that make up the varietal identity of this celebrated Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. Those lines  are presented in sharp focus with the 2012 edition. The nose is redolent of dark berry, crushed mineral, plum, spice and touch of white pepper. The wine is integrated and seamless, but it speaks with a strong and articulate voice.",,RP 88
2665,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"The 2012 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso is a wine to fall in love with at first sight. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers enormous fullness and generosity that accompanies all the senses. The effect is seamless with thick extraction and richness that is contrasted against the tonic freshness of the fruit. The wine is creamy, soft and enduring. You can count on this vintage to age ten years or more.",,RP 88
2666,Antinori,Guado al Tasso Matarocchio,"The 2012 Matarocchio is a pure (and amazing) expression of Cabernet Franc. The wine is beautiful on all fronts with a level of intensity that is impossible to duplicate. This seamless rendition shows softness, richness and great intensity with dark berry flavors that are fused together with spice, leather, tobacco and grilled herb. Cabernet Franc is showing amazing results in Bolgheri and this wine speaks to the grape's potential. It will surely age twenty years or more. The 2012 vintage will be released in the United States market in 2016.",,RP 88
2667,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 2012 Tignanello is a very handsome wine with dark fruit nuances that extend far beyond the normal spectrum for Sangiovese (and the smaller percentages of French grapes that complete this wine). This vintage, that started off with a very hot summer and ended with a cool harvest season, show a little more spice and Mediterranean herb on the finish. Grapes were harvested at the end of September and delivered slightly less alcohol than previous vintages. There is a point of freshness but the tannins are mature and yielding. In fact, the tannic management is spot-on and is complimented by the velvety and rich nature of the mouthfeel. Pretty mineral accents add a lasting touch of complexity. The 2012 Tignanello has the qualities for a successful evolution.",,RP 88
2668,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello,"Here is the ultimate wild card in the thick stack of aces that make up the Marchesi Antinori portfolio. It is the proverbial ""jolly"" (the name for the joker card in Italian) or the jack of all trades. The 2012 Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello can been seen as a huge provocation and that's the way I've decided to interpret it. When the Gran Selezione category was created in the Chianti Classico appellation, many important leaders hoped that the Antinori family would convert their landmark super Tuscan Tignanello into a Chianti Classico Gran Selezione wine. The Antinori clan indicated that they had no intention of removing Tignanello from its IGT Toscana status. Instead, they dedicated some fruit from the same vineyard site to this wine. The Riserva category is often seen as a stepping stone to Grand Selezione and I wonder if that is the direction this wine is headed? Will there one day be two wines from this historic vineyard: The IGT Tignanello and a Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Tenuta Tignanello? There's some food for thought. The wine is very balanced and nuanced with pretty mineral notes, followed by red cherry flavors and mild spice. ",,RP 88
2669,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"The 2012 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori is Sangiovese that has been enhanced by small percentages of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Fruit is sourced from the various properties owned by the Antinori family in the Chianti Classico appellation such as Badia a Passignano, Tenuta Tignanello and Peppoli. The family just bought a new property called San Sano near Castello di Ama and some of that fruit was used here too. This wine shows very nice ripeness with luscious, dark fruit flavors backed by spice and leather.",,RP 88
2670,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"The 2012 Villa Antinori is an IGT Toscana blend of Sangiovese (with the same clones used in Chianti Classico and Brunello di Montalcino respectively), Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. All the fruit is sourced from Marchesi Antinori's various estates in the region. This is a terrific value wine with a good sense of balance and aromatic intensity. The bouquet shows dark berry fruit, dried cherries, toasted almond and grilled herb. The finish reveals medium body. ",,RP 88
2671,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"Renzo Cotarella is one of a handful of people who believe that the Gran Selezione category should be 100% Sangiovese. The 2010 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano is an elegant and seamless mono-variety expression that shows loads of Sangiovese character in this classic vintage. Aged only in large oak casks, the wine sports fresh berry flavors with sweet tannins and a long, velvety finish. I feel that this wine might get buried between the many other products offered by Marchesi Antinori. I hope not because ultimately the Gran Selezione offers very specific, territory-driven qualities that set it apart. ",,RP 88
2672,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 2007 Tignanello is ripe with promise for the future. The wine has just started its evolutionary track with aromas of blackcurrant, dried blackberry and cherry. This was a warm but balanced vintage that shows beautiful results today and exceeds my already high expectations. There is a steady thickness and determination to the wine that carries it forward. This was the last vintage made in the Tignanello winery before the structure saw a major overhaul. Given the staying power of this historic wine, I feel that this vintage will hold easily for another 20 years or more.",,RP 88
2673,Antinori,Tignanello,"During the recorking ceremony for the 1971 Tignanello, I had the opportunity to taste four editions of the wine spanning the four decades of its production. The 1997 Tignanello was by far the most enjoyable of these wines. It is experiencing a perfect moment in its drinking window. Looking through The Wine Advocate archive, I see the suggestion of brett in a past review. I found absolutely no imperfections in this wine. Instead, the bouquet is generous and opulent with dark berry, spice, licorice and leather. Much of the Tignanello vineyards were replanted in the 1990s so I expect that the fruit came from younger vines. The finish is silky and long in persistency.",,RP 88
2674,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 1982 Tignanello is a mature and evolved wine that gives a good sense of the wine’s aging trajectory. This is a backwards looking wine with a bouquet that gives its best right now but that is unlikely to see any further evolution in the future. The bouquet offers tones of cured meat, savory spice, tar, old leather and dried fruit or prune. The acidity is still very much intact and this is what gives the wine its current staying power and tonic appeal. Silky tannins characterize the smooth finish.",,RP 88
2675,Antinori,Tignanello,"I tasted bottle number 73,974 of the 1971 Tignanello in September 2015. The 188 remaining bottles of that vintage in Antinori’s cellars were topped-off (with wine from the same vintage) and given new corks on that occasion. This was one of those bottles. The wine opens to a medium garnet appearance with amber and honey-colored hues. This is a mature wine with a bouquet that reveals spice, truffle, moist earth, resin and tar. There are subtle accents of dried fruit in there as well. The tannins are extra silky and refined. Some 45 years after the harvest the wine is holding up exceptionally well although it is definitely past its drinking prime. The emotional payoff for trying this revolutionary Tuscan red is impossible to measure. If you could score that, it would be off the charts. But the actual state of the wine today merits a more modest score. It's impossible to say what the future drinking window will look like. If I owned a bottle, I definitely would not be drinking it.",,RP 88
2676,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2010 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne is a well-built wine that shows the muscular side of this celebrated star of Tuscan winemaking. The Brunello opens to a thick, dark appearance with shapely aromas of dark cherry, plum, blackberry, leather dark chocolate and spice. The winemaking is impeccable, if rather stylized in terms of oak and fruit maturity. The aim here is to produce a wine the oozes softness and richness and this goal has been abundantly achieved. Pian delle Vigne is a Brunello that will excel in both the near and long term. ",,RP 88
2677,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2012 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato is 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah, aged in oak for eight months. A portion of the Merlot and the Syrah must was fermented at lower temperatures to preserve aromatic freshness. The wine opens to soft layers of bright cherry and forest berry with pretty shadings of spice, licorice and grilled herb. Smooth tannins and bright acidity make this a good pairing partner to oven-roasted lasagna.",,RP 88
2678,Antinori,Guado al Tasso Matarocchio,"I was blown away by the 2011 Matarocchio (100% Cabernet Franc). From 15-year-old vines planted some 60 meters above sea level on the Tuscan coast, this wine is absolutely stunning, delicious and simply unforgettable. Only produced in 2007, 2009 and 2011, this third edition shows towering aromas of sensuous dark fruit, leather and tobacco. If Cabernet Franc is the darling grape of this appellation, Matarocchio is a reason why. The mouthfeel is penetrating and powerful, but seamless and silky smooth at the same time. The tannin management is excellent. This is one to keep in the cellar.",,RP 88
2679,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"Forever the superstar, the 2011 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso is a delicious wine that never holds back in terms of intensity and seamless integration. Every detail has been finessed. The blend is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Each vineyard parcel is fermented separately to maintain varietal identity. The wine’s appearance is dark and luscious with thick extraction and a vibrant dark garnet hue. Generous aromas of dark fruit, tobacco and chocolate lift steadily from the glass. The mouthfeel is soft and yielding with a great sense of tannic persistency that holds up the finish, which can be counted in many long minutes. Give this wine five years or more to fully evolve.",,RP 88
2680,Antinori,Tignanello,"The 2011 Tignanello demonstrates a very ripe and fruit-forward personality with bursting cherry and blackberry folded within sweet spice, moist tobacco and honey-almond paste. Its texture is heavy and dense with sticky spots of sweetness (the alcohol is recorded at 14.5%). With such a fruit-heavy personality, the wine doesn’t reach the soaring heights or brilliant complexity we see in cooler vintages. It should veer toward a greater sense of focus and tightness with more bottle age.",,RP 88
2681,Antinori,Solaia,"I’m not fully convinced by the 2011 Solaia. It is a hedonistic and heady expression for sure, but it doesn’t come near the 97 points I awarded the 2010 vintage. In fact, the bouquet here is very ripe with thick tones of strawberry and blackberry folded within tobacco, leather and sweet spice. Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc offer flavors of rum cake and candied fruit. There’s a good amount of tannic firmness surrounded by thick extract and fleshiness.",,RP 88
2682,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello,"With fruit sourced from the same site as one of Italy's most celebrated red wines, the 2011 Chianti Classico Riserva Tenuta Tignanello is a wine that bridges two wine philosophies. It is a denomination wine (a Chianti Classico Riserva) with a super Tuscan tinge. The bouquet shows medium intensity with a distinctly floral personality with red rose and pressed blue flowers at the top. Bright acidity keeps the palate revived, sip after sip. ",,RP 88
2683,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori,"The 2011 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori is simple wine with a great sense of fresh cherry fruit at its core. The bouquet is embellished with touches of crushed mineral and soft baking spice that add a moderate degree of complexity. What this wine will ultimately be remembered for is as a food-friendly option to pair with oven-roasted pasta, lasagna or other homemade Italian meals for family and friends.",,RP 88
2684,Antinori,Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano,"Newly promoted to Grand Selezione status, the 2009 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano shows evolved tones of charred earth, dried cherry, chewing tobacco, tar, black olive and toasted hazelnut. Dusty spice and crushed mineral appear as the wine warms in the glass. The wine stills needs time to fully blossom and soften the remaining tannic sharpness.",,RP 88
2685,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2009 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne presents a plump, fruit-forward style with bold cherry notes that are laced with balsam herb, licorice, sweet almond, dried ginger and tobacco leaf. The wine’s acidity appears on the palate but the overall ripeness of the fruit suggests this will be an early-maturing wine. Drink: 2015-2021. 

Marchesi Antinori’s Pian delle Vigne estate has had its share of ups and downs and somehow its “down by the railroad tracks” association has stuck on some distant metaphoric level despite its best marketing efforts to the contrary. The estate is located on the lower plains of the Camigliano area near an old rail station on the outer perimeter of the Brunello appellation. Because its owners are from oh-so-far-away Florence, Pian delle Vigne has been saddled with an “outsiders” status within the tightly-knit Montalcino growers’ community. Truth is, estates like Pian delle Vigne (representing important outside financial investments in vineyards, distribution and promotions) have done much to elevate Brunello to the pinnacle of the world winemaking elite.

2686,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 1999 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne opens to a black, inky color and super concentration that adds weight and consistency to the palate. Pian delle Vigne is very obviously executed in an international style with etched oak tones paired next to overtly jammy fruit. With time, this wine has also developed a mature tertiary bouquet with spiced beef jerky, mesquite wood and barbecue smoke. The aromas are so strong, they are almost too much to take in at once. There’s no denying however that the wine boasts solid foundations and good construction. What it lacks is the softer definition and lighter nuances of Brunello. It gives more of a bang, than it does a whimper. Decant for up to four hours. Drink: 2014-2028.  ",,RP 88
2687,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 1997 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne puts on a very nice showing, only its performance is too short. The bouquet opens to generous tones of prune, crushed clove and Indian spice. Subtle renditions of balsam herb and licorice fill in the rear. The palate sees dry tannins and a short finish that leaves you expecting more. Drink: 2014-2018. ",,RP 88
2688,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2011 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato (65% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah) is a lovely wine with just enough cheerful informality to pair with hearty potato gnocchi with melted butter and fresh sage. The proverbial food-friendly Italian red, Il Bruciato offers balanced acidity, thick concentration and hearty black fruit flavors. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2018.  

Renzo Cotarella and the Antinori family have certainly hit their stride here at Guado al Tasso. They oversee a finely oiled machine that has happily shown consistently excellent results going on ten years now.

2689,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"A star on the vast stage that is the Antinori wine empire, the 2010 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso is a seamless and stunning wine. It’s one of those rare wines that inspires praise and excited conversation from the very second you raise the glass to your nose. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Baritone aromas of black cherry, black currant, cured meat, sweet spice, Spanish cedar, mocha and wild Mediterranean herbs come together in graceful unity. In the mouth, the wine is exceedingly smooth and decadent with a long velvety trail that softly coats the palate. This is one for the cellar. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2030.

2690,Antinori,Solaia,"The 2010 Solaia puts on an incredible show that hits all the senses and keeps your unyielding attention for as long as there is wine in the bottle. There are various ways to describe the bouquet. First, is the wine’s sweet side, as this beautiful 75-20-5 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc delivers ripe cherry, black currant, baking spice and dark chocolate. After that, the wine becomes redolent of tobacco, balsam, bay leaf, rum cake and dark licorice. The bouquet is all encompassing and complete. A firmly structured backbone is padded generously by the fleshy richness of its consistency. This is a gorgeous wine that will age for decades. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2040. 

The past 12 months mark one of the most exciting times in the long, long history of Antinori. Marchese Piero Antinori and his daughters inaugurated their monumental winery in Bargino, about 20 minutes from Florence in late 2012 after a series of last-minute preparations and sleepless nights. Winery doors officially opened to the public in 2013. It would be impossible to exaggerate to grandeur of this sprawling, multimillion-dollar underground edifice. Angelo Gaja told me at the opening that Antinori’s new winery is the most revolutionary event in modern Italian wine. I agree. With a museum, restaurant and tasting area, it represents Italy’s most ambitious effort yet to make wine the ultimate destination.

2691,Antinori,Tignanello,"Humming with energy and life from the very moment you put your nose in the glass, Marchesi Antinori’s 2010 Tignanello shows magnificent aromatic layering and an enormous capacity to peel back and reveal itself in beautiful slow motion. This is an articulate wine with a long story to tell about the quality of its profound 2010 fruit. This Tignanello has the elegance of 2004 and the structure of 2007. A brief note on the structure: The mouthfeel here is not broad and big. Instead, it shows a sharp and elegantly streamlined feel with impressive persistency. Compared to 2009, the Sangiovese component is slightly higher with 80% of the noble Tuscan variety followed by 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2035.

2694,Antinori,Muffato della Sala,"The precious 2009 Muffato della Sala (Sauvignon Blanc, Grechetto, Semillon, Traminer and Riesling) is stunning on all levels. Aromas of candied fruit, caramel, honey and marzipan burst from the glass. The mouthfeel is viscous, rich and syrupy – but there’s enough acidity to keep it from feeling heavy or fat. The hot 2009 vintage has shaped a spectacular Muffato. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2030. 

Marchesi Antinori’s estate in Umbria is a revolutionary force for the region. The amazingly successful Cervaro della Sala has arguably done more to raise the image of Italian white wine than any other single bottle.

A rich, layered Brunello, the 2008 comes across as a bit forced in the cellar, with copious French oak and a level of sweetness that is distracting. Pian delle Vigne remains a bit of a work in progress within the Antinori portfolio. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2023.

Sweet scents of pipe tobacco lead to cedar, savory herbs, mint and underbrush. The 2007 can be enjoyed today but I wouldn’t wait too long, as the flavors are already advancing. Hints of leather, licorice, tobacco and grilled herbs add complexity on the finish. This is a decidedly big, voluptuous style. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2017.

Floral notes meld into apricot jam, jasmine and sweet spices in a mid-weight, gracious Muffato that is all about elegance. A finely-knit finish rounds things out in style. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2018. 

Given the Antinori family’s rich heritage spanning 26 generations and a track record for making some of Italy’s most glamorous wines, it is easy to imagine that their Umbrian property, Castello della Sala, would be stately and elegant. Instead, the Castello reflects the values of an old-world, agrarian aristocracy that is more about tradition than flash. Those qualities come through in the wines as well. Over the last few years, the flagship Cervaro della Sala has become more elegant than ever, while the second wine, the Bramito del Cervo, is unfussy and beautiful. The estate’s sweet Muffato della Sala remains one of the most delicious wines in its category.

Freshly cut flowers, raspberries, spices, mint and licorice burst from the glass as this fabulous, viscerally thrilling wine shows off its pure class. Today the oak is a bit prominent, but that won’t be an issue by the time the wine is ready to drink. In one of my blind tastings, the 2009 Solaia was flat-out great. There is no shortage of pedigree here. The 2009 has calmed down a little from its youth, when it was a much more exuberant wine, and has now begun to close down in bottle. Solaia is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc from a single parcel within the Antinori family’s Tignanello vineyard. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2029. 

Longtime winemaker Renzo Cotarella has done a fabulous job with the flagships Tignanello and Solaia in 2009. In my blind tastings the pedigree of those two wines in particular came through with notable eloquence. The 2010 Tignanello and Solaia are both thrilling at this stage.

The 2009 impresses for its energy, drive and focus. Today, the 2009 comes across as slightly understated relative to many recent vintages, especially 2007 and 2008. There is a silkiness and polish that is reminiscent of the 2004. Tignanello is 75% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc from vineyards in San Casciano Val di Pesa, one of the most evocative hillsides in all of Italy.

The Riserva Marchese Antinori includes 10% international varieties in addition to the Sangiovese, which does make it the wine closest to Tignanello in the Antinori lineup. The 2008 is a big, broad shouldered wine with dark red cherries, tobacco, licorice and herbs in a medium to full-bodied style supported by vibrant tannins and mouth watering acidity. The Riserva Marchese Antinori shows terrific length and balance through to the dark, authoritative finish. Despite an international leaning, this is without question a Sangiovese-based wine.

Antinori seems to do everything well these days, from churning out millions of bottles of supermarket wines all the way to turning out superb versions of their many flagship bottlings. This is another impressive set of new releases with a number of highlights. Over the years oenologist Renzo Cotarella has moved away from the super-late harvests of the late 1990s/early 2000s in favor of picking slightly earlier, a decision that has paid off handsomely, especially over the last few years. Antinori’s 2008s, from a vintage that is quite inconsistent across the board, are superb.

This is a fairly plush style for this bottling, no doubt owing to the personality of the vintage. I don’t quite see the delineation or structure of the superb 2006, but in exchange the 2007 is much more pleasing to drink young. Tobacco, sweet herbs, licorice and dark red cherries leave a very positive, lasting impression. The Marchese Antinori is predominantly Sangiovese, with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon from the estate’s vineyards in Peppoli, Badia a Passignano and Tignanello. The darker color and flavor profile and presence of Cabernet relative to the 100% Sangiovese Badia a Passignano Riserva makes the Marchese a baby Tignanello of sorts. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2020.  

Antinori seems to do everything well these days, from churning out millions of bottles of supermarket wines all the way to turning out superb versions of their many flagship bottlings. This is another impressive set of new releases with a number of highlights. Over the years oenologist Renzo Cotarella has moved away from the super-late harvests of the late 1990s/early 2000s in favor of picking slightly earlier, a decision that has paid off handsomely, especially over the last few years. Antinori’s 2008s, from a vintage that is quite inconsistent across the board, are superb. I remember spending a few days near the estate’s Tignanello and Badia a Passignano estates in mid-August 2008. The days were very hot, but the nights were so cool that a sweater or light jacket was a necessity

2714,Antinori,Villa Antinori,"The 2007 Villa Antinori is an attractive, fleshy wine graced with expressive red fruit and an open, accessible personality, with no hard edges and plenty of vintage 2007 character. The round, generous finish is quite inviting. Villa Antinori is predominantly Sangiovese, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2014.

2715,Antinori,Muffato della Sala,"Sweet, succulent peaches, ripe pears, jasmine and light, floral honey are some of the nuances that emerge from Antinori’s 2007 Muffato della Sala. When the estate’s Muffato is firing on all cylinders it is one of Italy’s most delicious fresh, early-drinking dessert wines. That is certainly the case in 2007. Muffato della Sala is 60% Sauvignon Blanc and 40% Grechetto, Traminer and Riesling. In 2007 the fruit was picked towards the end of October and into November. The wine spent six months in French oak barrels before it was prepared for bottling. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2015.",,RP 91
2716,Antinori,Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne,"The 2006 Brunello di Montalcino Pian delle Vigne is one of the more open, accessible wines of the vintage. Dried red cherries, flowers, tobacco, spices and herbs are some of the notes that emerge from this attractive, fleshy Brunello. In 2006 the Pian delle Vigne is especially elegant, silky and refined, with gorgeous textural elegance and lovely overall balance. The Pian delle Vigne was fermented in stainless steel and spent 24 months in oak prior to being bottled. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2018.

2717,Antinori,Bolgheri Rosso Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato,"The 2008 Il Bruciato offers up vibrant red cherries, flowers and minerals in a relatively fresh, forward style for Bolgheri. Some of the mid-palate density of the finest vintages is missing, but the 2008 compensates for that with its terrific sense of balance and poise. This is a delicious entry-level wine from the Tuscan coast. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2016.  

I continue to be amazed at the high average quality Antinori achieves across a production that exceeds a whopping 20 million bottles per year. This is a fabulous set of new releases. Long-time Oenologist Renzo Cotarella could certainly have rested on his laurels; after all he is already one of Italy’s most celebrated winemakers. Instead, Cotarella continues to improve quality in a meaningful way. The highlights are the 2007s, which are off the charts. I first sampled Antinori’s 2007 Tignanello and Solaia two years ago, when they were still separate wines from individual parcels, but even then it was clear these were going to be special wines. Tasting Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Tignanello and Solaia vineyards, both in Chianti Classico, was an unforgettable lesson in the uniqueness of each of these fabulous terroirs. The Solaia vineyard in particular is clearly one of Italy’s greatest sites. Everything I tasted was loaded with personality and sheer character. One of the recent major changes at Antinori is the separate vinification of component wines for Guado al Tasso, Tignanello and Solaia, which began with the 2004 vintage. In 2007 Cotarella took that approach even further, with small parcel-by-parcel vinifications that allowed for maximum flexibility when the final blend for each wine was ultimately assembled. The 2007 harvest brings with it a number of additional changes. Syrah has been eliminated from Guado al Tasso in favor of Cabernet Franc, a grape that is proving to be exceptionally well-suited to the Tuscan coast. If the 2007 is any indication, Guado al Tasso is taking on a much more Bordeaux-like personality. The estate is also gradually moving toward slightly larger barrels and less new oak for their Sangioveses.

2718,Antinori,Solaia,"The 2007 Solaia saturates the palate with a heady array of super-ripe black cherries, plums, cassis, mocha and sweet French oak. There is an exotic quality to the Solaia I find totally irresistible. Despite its considerable ripeness and opulence, the 2007 Solaia is never heavy, rather it impresses for its extraordinary finesse and balance. Minerals, graphite and crushed rocks frame a long, seductive finish. This is a wonderful Solaia loaded with vintage and vineyard character. The 2007 Solaia is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new oak. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2027.

2719,Antinori,Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso,"The 2007 Guado al Tasso screams of Bolgheri. Sweet grilled herbs, mocha, spices and black cherry jam are woven into a generous, expansive frame. There is a wonderful sense of richness and warmth to the fruit that carries through to the round harmonious finish, where clean, minerally notes add freshness. This is simply gorgeous today, but it is young, and the oak needs to integrate. Still, it is impossible not to admire the 2007 Guado al Tasso. In 2007 Guado al Tasso is 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The late ripening Cabernet Franc, used in place of Syrah for the first time in 2007, adds a measure of freshness that had often been missing in previous vintages. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2024.

2720,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori,"The 2006 Chianti Classico Riserva Marchesi Antinori positively sparkles on the palate. Dark wild cherries, minerals, graphite, violets and spices are just some of the nuances that flow effortlessly from this beautiful, chiseled Riserva Marchesi Antinori. The French oak contributes an additional measure of volume and ampleness I doubt the wine truly needs given the superlative quality of the fruit in 2006. A rich fabric of minerals reappears to frame the intense, deeply satisfying finish. The Riserva Marchesi Antinori is a wine I grew up with when I was just starting to learn about Italian wine. The 2006 is one of the finest vintages I can remember tasting.

The tannins dry out a touch on the finish, which is the only thing that keeps the score from going higher. Still, this forward,  fruit-driven Chianti should drink nicely over the next few years.

Antinori’s 2005 Brunello is one of the successes of the vintage, particularly when one considers the large production in excess of 12,000 cases. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2021.

The oak remains prominent, but I am confident the wine will come together with bottle age. The Solaia vineyard is one of the most unique terroirs in Italy, and the wine has a track record of developing beautifully in bottle, even in smaller vintages. It will be fascinating to follow this Solaia as it matures. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2023.

My visit to Antinori’s Tignanello property in Chianti Classico provided an object lesson in the challenges of understanding the complexities and nuances of Tuscan terroir, something which can be extrapolated to many other regions within Italy as well. I saw vineyards where the two major terrains in these hills, galestro and alberese, alternated in groups of three to four rows within the same plot. As a result, the plants themselves were at slightly different points in their vegetative cycles. Back in the winery, oenologist Renzo Cotarella prepared a comprehensive tasting of Antinori’s two flagship wines, Tignanello and Solaia, with vintages going back to the mid-1990s. I will report on those verticals, which include a preview of 2006 and 2007, in an upcoming article that will be published in the Italy Report section of www.erobertparker.com. Both Tignanello and Solaia are outstanding in 2005. Readers may recall my enthusiasm over the 2004s. Of course the vintage was exceptional, but it is no accident that those wines were so successful. 2004 was the first vintage in which the lots for these wines were aged separately, with the final blend taking place at the end of the aging period, whereas previously the blend had been assembled just after the completion of malolactic fermentation. Given that wines develop and age in ways that sometimes surprise even the most experienced winemakers, waiting until the wines have had a chance to spend some time in barrel leaves the producer with much more certainty as to the quality and consistency of the final wine. In a difficult vintage such as 2005 the selection of lots prior to assembling and bottling was therefore especially critical.

This medium-bodied wine is redolent of fresh, perfumed jasmine, cloves, passion fruit and camomile. The bright, high-toned aromatics and flavors are best suited to soft, fresh cheeses and fruit-based desserts. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2010.

2737,Antinori,Chianti Classico Riserva Marchese Antinori,"Antinori’s flagship Chianti, the 2004 Chianti Classico Riserva Marchesi Antinori, reveals greater depth, vibrancy and freshness. Ripe black cherries, new leather, menthol, smoke and wild herbs flow from this sweet, layered Chianti. The wine is approachable today, but also has the tannic backbone and stuffing to insure another decade or so of very fine drinking. It spent 14 months in small French oak barrels prior to being bottled. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2019.

My visit to Antinori’s Tignanello property in Chianti Classico provided an object lesson in the challenges of understanding the complexities and nuances of Tuscan terroir, something which can be extrapolated to many other regions within Italy as well. I saw vineyards where the two major terrains in these hills, galestro and alberese, alternated in groups of three to four rows within the same plot. As a result, the plants themselves were at slightly different points in their vegetative cycles. Back in the winery, oenologist Renzo Cotarella prepared a comprehensive tasting of Antinori’s two flagship wines, Tignanello and Solaia, with vintages going back to the mid-1990s. I will report on those verticals, which include a preview of 2006 and 2007, in an upcoming article that will be published in the Italy Report section of www.erobertparker.com. Both Tignanello and Solaia are outstanding in 2005. Readers may recall my enthusiasm over the 2004s. Of course the vintage was exceptional, but it is no accident that those wines were so successful. 2004 was the first vintage in which the lots for these wines were aged separately, with the final blend taking place at the end of the aging period, whereas previously the blend had been assembled just after the completion of malolactic fermentation. Given that wines develop and age in ways that sometimes surprise even the most experienced winemakers, waiting until the wines have had a chance to spend some time in barrel leaves the producer with much more certainty as to the quality and consistency of the final wine. In a difficult vintage such as 2005 the selection of lots prior to assembling and bottling was therefore especially critical.

Endowed with massive amounts of concentration as well as structure, it is a big, powerful Solaia that does not sacrifice elegance or balance in its full-bodied personality. Packed with the essence of blackberries, chocolate, tar, smoke, cassis and menthol, this layered beauty exhibits great length and a persistent, warmly alcoholic finish.

Typical Sangiovese notes of red cherries, tobacco and underbrush dominate the flavor profile of this intensely flavored Tignanello that manages to be ripe and open, while retaining notable balance and freshness, although the tannins dry out a bit on the back end. This is a delicious Tignanello to enjoy now and over the next decade. The high altitude of the vineyards was clearly an asset in 2003. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2018.

Antinori’s Vin Santo is made predominantly from Trebbiano with some Malvasia and spent about three years in small oak barrels ranging in size from 50 to 200 liters.

Winemaking is overseen by Renzo Cotarella. The 2003 Guado al Tasso opens with a lovely nose redolent of spices and flowers followed by layers of sweet dark fruit, toasted oak and chocolate that reveal themselves in the glass. Still intensely backward, it presents hard tannins that should soften somewhat in the bottle. This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Syrah and other varietals spent 14 months in 100% new French oak. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2019.

After an excellent 1998, the wines of both 1999 and, particularly, 2000 were significantly less successful, but the 2001 Guado al Tasso should help forget this temporary unevenness. A dense ruby with purple highlights, the wine is loaded with aromas and flavors of perfectly ripe blackcurrant and blackberry fruit, minerals, sage, and thyme. The wine is more fragrant and more finely-spun than Antinori’s other Bordeaux wine, Solaia, but there is no lack of concentration and density here, though both are tempered by a satiny texture and polished tannins which are all elegance and breed.

(The percentage of Cabernet, in fact, was reduced from the previous 20% to 15% in this vintage, an important sign - I hope - of how the wind is blowing.) A blackish ruby, its perfectly focused plum and cassis fruit, given an additional complexity by notes of sweet herbs and saddle leather, is fully and completely shaped in flavors of impeccable volume, roundness, and depth, caressing and powerful and with an additional power on the close which promises another 15 years of gratifying drinking.

After an excellent 1998, the 1999 is not evolving particularly well in bottle and frankly, the 2000 is less than what one might expect. The nose, well spiced and herbaceous, is a bit green, and the tannins and acidity are both too prominent at the moment.

A dark and ample ruby/garnet, its pure and focused nose, very varietal, expresses plums, tobacco, Mediterranean herbs, and just a kiss of oak. Elegant and solid in flavor with sustained and supple tannins, much warmth, intensity, and drive, it is balanced, layered, and fresh with considerable personality. Drink: 2005-2015.

Medium-bodied, with a striking perfume of sweet black cherries, strawberry jam, licorice, vanilla, and tobacco, this pure, voluptuous Chianti has sweet tannin and enough acidity to provide vibrancy as well as definition.

The 1998, a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and 5% Cabernet Franc (8,000 cases), was aged for 14 months in new and one-year old French oak casks prior to being bottled without filtration. Yields were a low 30 hectoliters per hectare. The 1998 is a classically-structured, dense, full-bodied, youthful, well-balanced wine designed for cellaring. Its opaque ruby/purple color is accompanied by a classic bouquet of black currants, vanillin, earth, tobacco, and a touch of mint. Full-bodied, moderately tannic, dense, and concentrated, this backward 1998 needs 3-4 years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2020.

No other region in the world (other than Pomerol and St.-Emilion) has produced such great Merlots. The 1998 Guado Al Tasso (a 60% Cabernet Sauvignon/30% Merlot/10% Syrah blend) was fashioned from extremely small yields of 30 hectoliters per hectare, spent 14 months in 100% new French oak, and was bottled with minimal clarification. Malolactic was also done in barrel, so the wood is nicely assimilated. The dense ruby/purple-colored 1998 offers a glorious perfume of coffee, chocolate, blackberries, cassis, and vanillin.

Most 1996 Brunellos I have tasted are austere and tannic, although there are some gorgeous exceptions. This is certainly one of them. Pian delle Vigne's 1996 Brunello di Montalcino offers a complex bouquet of new saddle leather, spice box, soy, and earthy/plum/cherry fruit.

There are 8,000 cases of the 1997.  The sensational, opaque blue/purple-colored 1997 exhibits a complex nose of cedar, spice box, cassis, and subtle oak. With yields of only 30 hectoliters per hectare, and malolactic fermentation in barrel (a la Tignanello), this wine reveals extraordinary concentration, a thick, viscous texture, yet no sense of heaviness or ponderousness. It is a thrilling Solaia to consume over the next two decades. If a first-growth Pauillac were made in Tuscany, this would be it!

Full-bodied, with low acidity, superb concentration of black fruit, spice box, cedar, earth, and smoke, it is a wine of exceptional extract and marvelous balance that reflects the vintage's low acid, opulent/voluptuous personality.

A blackish ruby, its perfectly focused plum and cassis fruit, given an additional complexity by notes of sweet herbs and saddle leather, is fully and completely shaped in flavors of impeccable volume, roundness, and depth, caressing and powerful and with an additional power on the close which promises another 15 years of gratifying drinking.

2819,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"I hadn't drunk Leflaive's 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru for several years, but this precocious, demonstrative vintage continues to perform very well. Exhibiting aromas of citrus oil, pear, white flowers, freshly baked bread and bee pollen, it's full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with a fleshy, enveloping core of fruit, racy acids and a long, saline finish. Impressively, the last glass showed even better 24 hours later.",,RP 96
2820,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Domaine Leflaive's 1999 Montrachet Grand Cru is drinking superbly today, bursting with aromas of buttered orchard fruit, fresh peach, confit citrus, croissants and sweet spices. Full-bodied, broad and enveloping, with terrific structure and a lively spine of acidity, it's a dramatic but controlled wine with a seamless, complete profile. It's the finest mature Montrachet from Leflaive I've ever tasted.",,RP 96
2821,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 1985 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles continues to drink brilliantly, offering up inviting aromas of iodine, popcorn, confit orange, freshly baked bread and nutmeg. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and seamless, it's suave, layered and complete, true to the immensely stylish form of the Virot-era Leflaive wines.",,RP 96
2822,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Leflaive's 2019 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with scents of Anjou pear, orange oil, clear honey, white flowers and freshly baked bread, framed by a deft touch of youthful reduction. Full-bodied, concentrated and incisive, it's textural but taut, its satiny attack segueing into a deep, chiseled mid-palate, concluding with a long, electric finish. This is a brilliant Chevalier with a long life ahead of it.",,RP 96
2823,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Leflaive's 2019 Montrachet Grand Cru was vinified and matured in a single 300-liter barrel made by Stéphane Chassin. Wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, honeycomb, hazelnuts, buttered toast, orange oil and baking spices, it's full-bodied, rich and layered, with lovely mid-palate amplitude, tangy acids and chalky structuring extract. Concluding with a long, resonant finish, it will be to all intents and purposes unobtainable.",,RP 96
2824,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"I'm inclined to nominate the 2019 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes as Leflaive's finest premier cru this year. Wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, citrus oil, fresh peach, toasted nuts and smoke, it's full-bodied, rich and satiny, with an immensely concentrated and incisive profile. Taut and chiseled despite its mid-palate plenitude, it's built to cellar.",,RP 96
2825,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2019 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru has turned out very well indeed, offering up aromas of pear, orange oil, white flowers, nutmeg and freshly baked bread, framed by a subtle touch of youthful reduction. Full-bodied, satiny and elegantly muscular, it's racy and concentrated, with more mid-palate plenitude and chalky structure than the more delicate Bienvenues.",,RP 96
2826,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of peach, pear, hazelnuts and dried white flowers, framed by a deft touch of youthful reduction, the 2019 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, its concentrated core of fruit framed by racy acids and chalky extract. Like the Pucelles, this is precise and fine boned, but it's also more muscular and intense.",,RP 96
2827,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Aromas of pear, hazelnuts, crisp green apple, fresh peach and orange oil, framed by a touch of youthful reduction, preface Leflaive's 2019 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières, a medium to full-bodied, ample and incisive wine with a fleshy and enveloping core of fruit that's underpinned by a tangy spine of acidity that animates the long, saline finish.",,RP 96
2828,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2019 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon has turned out very nicely, mingling aromas of pear and citrus oil with hints of wheat toast, fresh bread and hazelnuts in an inviting bouquet. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, with terrific cut and a long, saline finish, it's taut and incisive, showing promise for the cellar.",,RP 96
2829,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Finer boned and less concentrated than the extraordinary Combettes, the 2019 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles offers up aromas of peach, orange zest, white flowers, freshly baked bread and hazelnuts. Medium to full-bodied, saline and chiseled, this might just be a little shy after bottling, but on first encounter, it doesn't dominate Leflaive's range of premiers crus to the extent that it usually does.",,RP 96
2830,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"The 2019 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane is also a touch reductive out of the gates, unwinding to reveal aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, hazelnuts, dried white flowers and smoke. Medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with lively acids and a long, saline finish, it's a seamless, elegant wine from a parcel located just above Pierre Morey's Meursault Perrières.",,RP 96
2831,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2019 Puligny-Montrachet Village unwinds in the glass, shedding a touch of youthful reduction to reveal aromas of pear, orange oil, white flowers and hazelnuts. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with a tangy spine of acidity, fine concentration and a chalky finish, it's a success.",,RP 96
2832,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"Aromas of pear, hazelnuts and citrus zest introduce Leflaive's 2019 Bourgogne Blanc, a medium to full-bodied, racy and concentrated wine that's chiseled and penetrating, concluding with chalky grip. This is a fine effort that punches above its weight.",,RP 96
2833,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"This magnum of the 2008 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is an original release, and it is a little more developed than the ""reconditioned"" 750-milliliter bottle I reviewed last year. Offering up aromas of mandarin orange, marmalade, honeycomb, fresh pastry, white flowers and vanilla pod, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and penetrating, with lively acids and a long, exotic finish. While this is drinking well, it's a little open-knit for a 12-year-old Chevalier-Montrachet, especially in magnum, and—as with most Leflaive white Burgundies from this era of endemic premature oxidation—I wouldn't bet on it making old bones. In that respect, it was interesting to see what a difference the domaine's reconditioning had made to the last example of this wine that I encountered.",,RP 96
2834,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"After my review of a reconditioned bottle last year, this encounter with Domaine Leflaive's 2006 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru was a salutary reminder of the reality consumers experience with this estate's wines in the late 2000s and early 2010s—and above all in the 2006 vintage. Entirely oxidized, the wine was undrinkable.",,RP 96
2835,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2018 Montrachet Grand Cru is showing beautifully from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of pear, Meyer lemon, honeycomb, dried white flowers, toasted nuts and smoke, framed by a deft application of new oak. Full-bodied, rich and layered, it's concentrated and enveloping, with a deep and textural mid-palate, lively acids and a long, immensely persistent finish.",,RP 96
2836,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2018 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has turned out brilliantly, unwinding in the glass with sachets of orange oil, white flowers, crisp orchard fruit, blanched almonds, vanilla pod and buttered toast. Full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, it's deep and multidimensional, with racy acids and a long, electric finish. This is one 2018 white Burgundy that is built for sustained bottle age.",,RP 96
2837,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Full-bodied, rich and concentrated, the 2018 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is a textural, elegantly muscular wine evocative of pear, toasted almonds, white flowers, peach and vanilla pod. Layered and powerful, it concludes with a long, saline finish. It's more dramatic and broader-shouldered than the suave, seamless Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet this year.",,RP 96
2838,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Scents of pear, white flowers, almond paste, buttered toast, citrus zest and smoke preface the 2018 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru, a full-bodied and satiny wine that's layered and fleshy, with a satiny attack that segues into a tightly wound core and a chalky finish. This, too, should reward bottle age.",,RP 96
2839,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2015 Bourgogne Blanc continues to show well from bottle, exhibiting aromas of ripe lemons, pear and wheat toast, complemented by a delicate top note of petrol. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, its fleshy core of fruit underpinned by lively acids. A touch broader and richer than it was two years ago, this Bourgogne is showing well, but it falls somewhere between youth and maturity right now, as it hasn't yet acquired all the aromatic complexity that will come with another few years in the cellar.",,RP 88
2840,Domaine Leflaive,Pouilly-Fuissé En Vigneraie,"The 2017 Pouilly-Fuissé En Vigneraie was the earliest-picked of all Leflaive's Mâconnais wines, but it's nevertheless the amplest and most textural wine in the range, offering up notes of minty orchard fruit and white flowers and a broad-shouldered but incisive palate, with a tight-knit core and a saline finish.",,RP 88
2841,Domaine Leflaive,Pouilly-Fuissé La Chaneau,"Notes of pear, hazelnut, citrus oil and white flowers preface the 2017 Pouilly-Fuissé La Chaneau, a medium to full-bodied, dense and tensile wine that has a blocky, tight-knit core and tangy acids and seems to be well-adapted for aging.",,RP 88
2842,Domaine Leflaive,Pouilly-Fuissé,"The 2017 Pouilly-Fuissé derives from multiple parcels in Soultré and which now sees the same élevage as the domaine's wines from Puligny. It's showing well, exhibiting aromas of ripe lemons, beeswax, dried white flowers and blanched almonds, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny-textured palate with more flesh, concentration and length than any of the Mâcon-Verzé bottlings.",,RP 88
2843,Domaine Leflaive,Mâcon-Verzé Le Monté,"Another new lieu-dit bottling is the 2017 Mâcon-Verzé Le Monté, which derives from a vineyard located above the hamlet of Escolles on a plateau rich in flint, and fully one-third of which was fermented and raised in wood. Unfurling in the glass with scents of pear, pastry cream, smoky and toasted nuts, it's medium to full-bodied, with a broader attack and a more saline finish than the Chênes, though it shares the incisiveness that distinguishes all of Leflaive's Mâcon cuvées this year.",,RP 88
2844,Domaine Leflaive,Mâcon-Verzé Les Chênes,"A new lieu-dit bottling from Leflaive that derives from two southeast-facing parcels, the 2017 Mâcon-Verzé Les Chênes offers up aromas of white peach, Meyer lemon and crisp orchard fruit, followed by a medium-bodied, satiny palate, with racy acids, good concentration and more texture and amplitude than the regular Mâcon-Verzé.",,RP 88
2845,Domaine Leflaive,Mâcon-Verzé,"Aromas of minty green orchard fruit, citrus pith and hazelnuts introduce the 2017 Mâcon-Verzé, a medium-bodied, bright and refreshing wine with a delicately satiny attack, a pretty core of fruit and a saline finish. It's an understated Mâcon that was picked on the early side to emphasize freshness.",,RP 88
2846,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Dense and reserved, Leflaive's 2012 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru unwinds in the glass with aromas of pear, toasted bread, citrus zest, mandarin and crisp peach, framed by a touch of light reduction and new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and powerful, with tangy acids, prodigious concentration and a penetrating, mouthwatering finish. This is a muscular, tight-knit Chevalier that will need time. The product of a humid spring and yields reduced by mildew and hail, by the numbers the 2012 possesses only 13.05% alcohol with a low pH of 3.0.",,RP 88
2847,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"A charming, fleshy wine, the 2009 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru offers up a generous bouquet of ripe citrus fruit, confit lemon, pears, warm bread, honeycomb and mandarin. On the palate, it's full-bodied, lavish and enveloping, with a textural attack, a rich and ample core of fruit and a long, expansive finish. This is a ripe but open-knit vintage of Leflaive's Chevalier, even though with 13.45% alcohol it's lower-octane than all the top vintages of the Pierre Morey era. If the wine has a fault, it's one extensible to the vintage as a whole: a lack of liveliness and tension.",,RP 88
2848,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2007 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru opens in the glass with scents of lemon oil, clear honey, confit citrus, warm bread, almond paste and a very discrete touch of smoky reduction. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and multidimensional, with unusual volume and breadth for the vintage, striking concentration and an incisive spine of acidity, concluding with a long, vibrant and chalky finish. While this 2007 is still a few years from true maturity, it clearly numbers among the wines of the vintage.",,RP 88
2849,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"When you happen upon a pristine bottle of Leflaive's 2005 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, it's a terrific wine that clearly rans among the white Burgundies of the vintage, and this was just such a bottle. Offering up a stunning bouquet of confit lemons, honeycomb, vine blossom and freshly baked bread, it's full-bodied, ample and multidimensional, with incredible concentration, a firm chassis of structuring dry extract, lively acids and a long finish that still displays considerable youthful drive. This is a muscular, imposing Chevalier that nods to the 1989 vintage in style, though if anything it's better balanced. Today, while it's still a youthful wine, it's beginning to arrive at early maturity, and it's as pleasurable as it is impressive. Sadly, however, I have encountered oxidized bottles of the 2005, and this perfect example only made that more poignant. By the numbers, it possesses 13.7% alcohol with a pH of 3.22.",,RP 88
2850,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"All of Domaine Leflaive's 2004s were heavily reduced out of the gates—the Pucelles being the worst offender—and the 2004 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is still quite strongly marked by the toasty aromas of reduction, offering up notes of grilled bread, pear, dried white flowers, honeycomb and iodine. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and textural, with a bright spine of acidity and a tight-knit, compact profile that's still quite firm and unyielding, with good concentration and a somewhat mordant, delicately herbaceous finish. My reservation here is that while this is a fine wine in its introverted, reductive style, it's at odds with the aesthetic that defined the great Leflaive wines of the 1970s and 1980s—wines that were all about elegance and satiny plenitude.",,RP 88
2851,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2003 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is such an atypical vintage that it's hard to know how to score it. With a pH of 3.75 and 14% alcohol, there's almost no acidity—Leflaive opting, unlike many producers, not to add any tartaric acid in this hot, low-yielding vintage. Offering up aromas of preserved peaches, honeycomb, orange rind, white flowers and licorice, it's full-bodied, rich and fat, with an unctuous, oily texture, a massive endowment of chewy dry extract and a long, sweet—despite the wine containing no residual sugar—and exotic finish. While the wine's low acidity makes it a little cumbersome, it's also true that it's aging at a glacial pace, and it's very hard to predict how it will taste in another two decades. This Chevalier is certainly one of the high points of the 2003 white Burgundy vintage but also a wine that exemplifies its extremes.",,RP 88
2852,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"This was by some margin the best bottle that I've encountered to date of Leflaive's 2002 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, and the wine is beginning to become very interesting on the nose, wafting from the glass with complex aromas of citrus oil, mandarin, warm bread, fresh peach, pear and vanilla pod. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and layered, with a fleshy, multidimensional core, lively acids and an elegant profile, without the muscle of a vintage such as 2005 or 1989 but with more concentration than a supple, open-knit year such as 2000. By the numbers, it's 14% alcohol with a pH of 3.24.",,RP 88
2853,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Leflaive's 2001 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru emerged as one of the real sleepers of this tasting, bursting from the glass with an expressive and botrytis-inflected bouquet that mingles scents of grilled peaches and confit citrus with nuances of barley sugar, petrol and freshly baked bread. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with excellent depth at the core, impressive vibrancy and a long, precise finish. Like the 2000 Chevalier, the more concentrated 2001 is in its plenitude of expression and makes for immensely pleasurable drinking, though readers with a lower tolerance for botrytis-derived exotica—something that, within limits, I tend to embrace as a facet of vintage expression—will like it less than I did. By the numbers, the 2001 boasts 13.66% alcohol and a pH of 3.40.",,RP 88
2854,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2000 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is drinking very well today, wafting from the glass with aromas of warm bread, ripe pears, citrus oil, mandarin, dried white flowers and a delicate top note of iodine. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny and open-knit, with lively acids, a fleshy and moderately concentrated core and a nicely defined finish. From a vintage characterized by generous yields and an early harvest, the 2000 Chevalier's supple, generous and expressive personality is typical of the year. Now is a great moment to drink it. By the numbers, this attained 14% alcohol and a finished pH of 3.32.",,RP 88
2855,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Like the domaine's 1996 vintage, Leflaive's 1999s were quite marked by reduction out of the gates, and the 1999 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru remains somewhat introverted. Offering up a smoky bouquet of waxy citrus rind, grilled bread, confit lemon and iodine, it's full-bodied, powerful and tight-knit, with considerable dry extract and concentration, but not much in the way of plenitude or expressiveness. If the Leflaive style is all about elegance, then the 1999 Chevalier is rather blocky and foursquare. Perhaps more will come with time, but for now, my sense is that the 1999—like the 1996—will never quite realize all its potential. That's a pity, as this is a superb white Burgundy vintage.",,RP 88
2856,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"From a vintage that gets my nod as the weakest of the decade for the whites of the Côte de Beaune, the 1998 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is showing quite well, offering up an exotic bouquet of mandarin, saffron, barley sugar, honeycomb, anise and citrus blossom. On the palate, it's full-bodied, rich and layered, with commendable purity and precision, concluding with a delicately mineral finish. There's no reason to wait.",,RP 88
2857,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"From a warm, ripe vintage, the 1997 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru offers up aromas of dried white flowers, orange rind, confit citrus, iodine and freshly baked bread. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and concentrated, with chewy extract and a broad, expansive mid-palate, with ripe acids and a long, subtly exotic finish. If the 1998 Chevalier owes some exotic qualities to botrytis, the concentration and confit quality of the 1997 have more to do with passerillage. By the numbers, the wine attained 13.95% alcohol with a pH of 3.17.",,RP 88
2858,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"This was a fine performance for Leflaive's 1996 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, a complex but reserved wine that opens in the glass with aromas of citrus oil, confit lemon, beeswax, dried white flowers and candied peel, with comparatively little in the way of reductive top notes that distinguished it even merely a handful of years ago. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny-textured and concentrated, built around an incisive line of acidity and still decidedly tight-knit and compact in profile. This bottle is an example of a 1996 white Burgundy that is aging very gracefully, but if there's one criticism, it's that the wine can't match the plenitude of the great wines in this tasting. That may come with time, but I suspect the 1996 Chevalier will always be more impressive than it is pleasurable. By the numbers, this wine possesses 13.75% alcohol and a pH of 3.12—perhaps its full potential would have been unleashed, as my neighbor Michel Bettane opined, had it been harvested a week later?",,RP 88
2859,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Leflaive's 1995 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is showing well, unfurling in the glass with a complex and rich bouquet of peach, mandarin, confit lemon, honeycomb, saffron and freshly baked bread. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and layered, with a deep and concentrated core, its chewy chassis of dry extract enveloped in fleshy fruit, and it's still lively and vibrant as it approaches its 24th birthday. This was a year of low yields—a cold spell disrupted flowering—and a warm summer, and that's reflected by this muscular, powerful Chevalier.",,RP 88
2860,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Purists will adore the 1993 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, a steely, racy vintage that has evolved marvelously in bottle. Aromas of dried white flowers, mandarin and lemon oil mingle with scents of beeswax, vanilla pod, saffron and warm bread in a complex bouquet, introducing a full-bodied, ample and incisive wine with a deep, layered and tensile mid-palate, striking energy and concentration and a long, penetrating finish. This utterly classic Chevalier is drinking very well today, but well-cellared bottles will easily enjoy another decade's longevity. Served on its own, rather than alongside the ampler, more powerful 1992, 1990 and 1989, this overlooked vintage might well merit a higher score. By the numbers, it attained 13.66% alcohol and a pH of 3.12.",,RP 88
2861,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Another of this tasting's highlights was the 1992 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, an exotically aromatic vintage of this great wine that bursts from the glass with scents of fresh peaches, vine and citrus blossom, pear, mandarin oil and frangipane. It's full-bodied, broad and satiny, with an ample and envelopingly textural profile that displays considerable mid-palate volume, impressive depth and concentration and a long, precise finish. Produced from fully ripe, golden-hued grapes, the 1992's aromas could easily give the impression that the wine saw a little botrytis, yet I'm assured that this wasn't the case. By the numbers, it attained a pH of 3.08 and 14% alcohol—making it both lower in alcohol and lower in pH than both the 1990 and 1989—yet given this Chevalier's exotic character and extravagantly expressive style, the inverse could easily be imagined.",,RP 88
2862,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"This was a challenging white Burgundy vintage, but the 1991 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has aged extremely well and emerged as one of the sleepers of this tasting. Offering up an expressive bouquet of white flowers, honeyed apples and orange rind, it's full-bodied, unctuously textured and powerful, with ripe acids, considerable concentration and chewy structuring extract, concluding with a long and expansive finish. While it's hardly given away, this represents good value in the context of mature vintages of Leflaive's Chevalier, and I wouldn't hesitate to pick up well-cellared bottles for drinking over the next decade. By the numbers, the wine finished with 14.1% alcohol and pH 3.26.",,RP 88
2863,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"While I entertained higher expectations of the 1989, it was in fact the 1990 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru that emerged as the wine of the tasting, blossoming in the glass with a complex bouquet of confit lemon, orange rind, dried white flowers, pastry cream, warm bread and vanilla pod. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, satiny textured and enveloping, with broad shoulders, a lively spine of acidity and superb amplitude and concentration, concluding with a long, penetrating finish. Powerful and strikingly complete, this is a Chevalier that more than nods to Montrachet in style. But by the numbers alone, it was cropped at 57 hectoliters per hectare and finished up with 14.1% alcohol and pH 3.23. This is by some margin the finest bottle of Leflaive's 1990 Chevalier-Montrachet that I've encountered.",,RP 88
2864,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Leflaive's 1989 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is still a very youthful wine as it approaches its 30th birthday, blossoming in the glass with aromas of ripe citrus fruit, beeswax, fresh peach, white flowers and warm bread. On the palate, it's full-bodied, muscular and concentrated, with a vibrant and tight-knit core that's still quite firmly structured, concluding with a long and resonant finish. With a pH of 3.36 and fully 14.4% alcohol, this is analytically the ripest wine in this tasting, yet it is exquisitely balanced and can age for another two decades in a good cellar.",,RP 88
2865,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes is showing very well indeed from bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of Anjou pear, toasted nut and white flowers, framed by some classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad-shouldered and textural, with succulent acids, excellent depth at the core and a muscular, fleshy profile. This is shaping up to rank as one of Leflaive's best 2016s.",,RP 88
2866,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Leflaive's 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières is showing very well, unfurling in the glass with a lovely bouquet of green orchard fruits, fresh peach, lemon oil, wheat toast and a classy framing of nutty new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and pure, with a refined, satiny, expansive profile that contrasts with the blockier Combettes, displaying fine concentration at the core, racy acids and a long, penetrating finish. While yields were very low in this vineyard, this Folatières remains quite classic in profile.",,RP 88
2867,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"Tasted from bottle, the 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane offers up a pretty bouquet of crisp Anjou pear, white flowers, hazelnut cream and wet stones that's a little high-toned in profile if it's served too cold, though any questions of excess volatility are dispelled as it approaches room temperature. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, delicately textural and incisive, with brisk acids, a tight-knit but nicely concentrated core and a precise, racy finish. Somewhat austere in profile, this is a promising candidate for bottle age. This was one of the parcels that escaped the 2016 frosts.",,RP 88
2868,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Tasted from bottle, Leflaive's 2016 Puligny-Montrachet Village is showing well, wafting from the glass with a fragrant bouquet of pink grapefruit, white peach and spring flowers, complemented by a delicate touch of citrus blossom on the upper register. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, with a glossy attack, good depth and concentration and a bright but open-knit, charming core, concluding with an elegantly saline finish. The wine's aromatic exotica mark it out as a product of its vintage, but it's a classy Puligny Village from this important domaine.",,RP 88
2869,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon is already quite expressive, wafting from the glass with pretty aromas of pear, wheat toast, peaches and honeycomb, with citrus top notes on the upper register. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and pure, with ripe acids and a surprisingly open-knit profile, falling a little short on the finish. This is a delicious bottle of white Burgundy, but it doesn't seem to possess the concentration and cut of a great vintage.",,RP 88
2870,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru delivers a vibrant but reserved bouquet of lemon zest, white flowers and crushed chalk that is still some distance from displaying all its breadth of expression. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and tensile, with a tight-knit core, searingly intense chalky extract and an electric sense of energy, concluding with a long finish. This is the most linear Chevaliers I tasted in the 2017 vintage, which was typically somewhat more open at the same stage in Anne-Claude's day, so it will be interesting to see how much plenitude it displays in bottle.",,RP 88
2871,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2017 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru unfurls in the glass with a reticent bouquet of lemon rind, citrus, hazelnut cream, white flowers and mandarin oil. On the palate, it's full-bodied, both denser and blockier than the Bienvenues-Bâtard, with exceptional concentration, tangy acids and a long finish. Today, the wine is only partially formed, but it's immensely promising. Pierre Vincent told me that it attained 12.8% natural alcohol, but despite that rather modest degree for a grand cru white Burgundy, it displays plenty of power and substance.",,RP 88
2872,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Like the Pucelles, the 2017 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is quite tensile and reserved, unfurling in the glass with aromas of green orchard fruit, iodine, orange rind and creamy new wood. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, textural and fleshy, but taut—even firm—at the core, with good concentration, tangy acid and a bright, chalky finish. Like all these releases, I'm looking forward to seeing it from bottle.",,RP 88
2873,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles wafts from the glass with aromas of spring flowers, white peach, lemon, pastry cream and blanched almonds. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural but tangy, with a pure, fine-boned profile. It was quite reserved when I tasted it, so I suspect it only needs time to take on the breadth and dimension that characterize a great Pucelles, but for now, the wine is quite tensile and linear.",,RP 88
2874,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Combettes is very promising, unwinding in the glass with notes of lemon, tangerine oil, dried white flowers, honeycomb and spices. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with broader shoulders than the Clavoillon, with tangy balancing acids, thrilling incipient complexity and a long, saline finish.",,RP 88
2875,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"A pretty bouquet of citrus blossom, Meyer lemon, crisp green pear and pastry cream introduces the 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Folatières, a medium to full-bodied wine that's beautifully satiny and elegant, with excellent depth and dimension, a harmonious sense of completeness and bright balancing acids, concluding with a long and pure finish. This was the first of Leflaive's holdings to be picked in 2017.",,RP 88
2876,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon is excellent, and a clear step up over the Puligny Village, something that can't be taken for granted. Offering up aromas of lemon, beeswax, white flowers and blanched almonds, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and nicely concentrated, with tangy acids, chewy extract and a long, precise finish. It's promisingly tight-knit and should develop further before it's bottled.",,RP 88
2877,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"The 2017 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane offers up aromas of green apples, tart Anjou pear, spring flowers and mint. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied,  with good concentration and chewy extract—Leflaive performed a green harvest on this young vines this year—underpinned by juicy acids and concluding with a pure finish. This is a promising Meursault in the making.",,RP 88
2878,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2017 Puligny-Montrachet Village wafts from the glass with notes of lemon rind, pastry cream, white flowers and a light framing of smoky reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and vibrant, with tangy acids, lovely purity and an elegant, precise profile. I suspect it will further gain in depth and dimension with additional élevage.",,RP 88
2879,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"Aromas of waxy citrus rind, green apples and light reduction introduce the 2017 Bourgogne Blanc, a medium to full-bodied wine and elegantly glossy attack, a succulent core of fruit, and excellent cut and intensity for its level, concluding with a long finish. This is routinely one of the best generic bottlings to be found, and this year's rendition is no exception.",,RP 88
2880,Domaine Leflaive,Mâcon-Verzé,"The 2016 Mâcon-Verzé offers up notes of green orchard fruit, pastry cream, dried white flowers and honeycomb, framed by subtle reduction that dissipates in the glass. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, bright and tangy, with a delicately glossy attack, moderate depth at the core and a pure, saline finish. It doesn't match the concentration of the 2015 rendition, but it's both more vibrant and more approachable. This Mâcon-Verzé was vinified and matured in stainless steel for some 15 months before bottling under Diam.",,RP 88
2881,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Chevalier-Montrachet from Domaine Leflaive is stunning from bottle, wafting from the glass with a lovely nose of lemon pith, wet stones, spring flowers and toasted nuts. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, concentrated and multidimensional, with extraordinary intensity and mid-palate depth, a long, lingering finish and an effortless sense of cohesion and completeness. But what's especially impressive about this Chevalier is its grace and textural elegance in this vintage: while its concentration and amplitude certainly reflect the year, nothing is out of place. A step up over even the superb Bâtard-Montrachet and one of the high points of the 2015 vintage in white Burgundy.",,RP 88
2882,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Leflaive 2015 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is a superb achievement in the 2015 vintage, wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of white peach, fresh bread, pear, preserved citrus, beeswax and crisp yellow orchard fruit. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and authoritative, distinguished by its sense of completeness and control, with terrific depth and amplitude and a long, reserved finish. The Bâtard is one of the high-points of the Leflaive range this year, fully realizing the potential of the vintage.",,RP 88
2883,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2015 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru is showing very well, opening in the glass with a reticent but detailed bouquet of fresh pear, white peach, tangerine oil, spring flowers, pastry cream and a delicate framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and effortlessly complete, with succulent acids, elegantly glossy textural impact and understated persistence on the finish. This cuvée is beautifully balanced and full of energy, but it has definitely closed down after bottling and will demand five years in the cellar at the very minimum before it begins to expatiate. Matured in 20% new oak and bottled under Diam 30.",,RP 88
2884,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles offers up a ripe but reticent nose of lemon cream, mandarin, yellow orchard fruit and apple blossom. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and the most ample of Leflaive's premier crus this year, with a glossily textural attack, good depth at the core and grand cru amplitude followed by a saline, tangy finish. In style, this Pucelles nods to neighboring Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet, but it isn't quite as concentrated, and I'd expect it to offer more precocious appeal in its youth.",,RP 88
2885,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Combettes is another terrific bottling from this famous domaine, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of apple, pear, lime, grapefruit pith and almond cream. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, glossy and deep at the core, its great concentration and chewy extract underpinned by succulent acids, its finish pure and precise. In style, Combettes tends to nod to Bâtard-Montrachet, but like this year's Bâtard, this remains beautifully controlled and poised despite its undeniable mid-palate heft.",,RP 88
2886,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"In bottle, Leflaive's 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Folatieres has found reserves of tension and precision that belie its buxom showing from barrel, opening in the glass with a pure bouquet of white peach, stone fruit pits, confit lemon, spring flowers, pastry cream and a discrete framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and complete with impressive harmony and a long, classy finish. Elegant, harmonious and youthfully reserved, this classic Folatières should really hit its stride after five years in bottle. Matured in 20% new oak and bottled under Diam 30.",,RP 88
2887,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"Of all the domaine's wines, Leflaive's 2015 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon is arguably the cuvée that has benefited the most from biodynamic viticulture, as what was formerly a rather foursquare, blocky premier cru in the 1990s is now routinely more dynamic and lively. The 2015 opens in the glass with a pretty bouquet of fresh pear, citrus zest, orange blossom and pastry cream. On the palate, the wine is bright, energetic and pure with good depth and a tangy, penetrating finish. While the race is close today, the Clavoillon is holding more in reserve than the domaine's excellent Puligny Village, and its acids are brighter, so this will reward a bit of patience.",,RP 88
2888,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Leflaive's 2015 Puligny Montrachet Village is just as impressive from bottle as it was from barrel, opening in the glass with a youthfully reserved bouquet of citrus oil, white flowers, apple skin, subtle nutmeg and a framing of new oak. On the palate, the wine is glossy and full-bodied, but the power and concentration of the 2015 vintage is balanced by succulent acids and almost chewy structure, and its finish is pure and precise. While this is a comparatively muscular rendition of the village cuvée, all the elements are in harmony, and it should amply reward bottle age. Tasted blind, it would embarrass many producers' premier crus. Matured in 15% new oak and bottled under Diam 30.",,RP 88
2889,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"The 2015 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane is the weak link in the Leflaive portfolio this year, and tasted from bottle, it is clear that it hasn't found the precision that it lacked in tank. The nose is more marked by new oak than the domaine's other wines, offering up aromas of pear, apricot, barrel vanillin and yellow apple; the prelude to a medium-full, ample wine which lacks depth or tension, its finish diffuse and brief. If this judgment appears harsh, it's only because the failings of Domaine Leflaive's lone Meursault are thrown into relief by the superb quality of the rest of the range in the 2015 vintage.",,RP 86
2890,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"While 2005 marks the vintage when premature oxidation began to make extensive depredations in the Leflaive cellars, this bottle of the 2005 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles was actually quite reductive on opening, unfurling in the glass with notes of mandarin oil, wheat toast, pear and pastry cream as its gentle leesiness dissipated. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and quite textural, with chewy, almost phenolic extract and good length, nicely balanced in this sometimes-blowsy vintage. My only criticism would be that in personality this bottle seemed to nod more to Meursault than Puligny.",,RP 86
2891,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Batard Montrachet Grand Cru was vinified together rather than in four different parcels due to the frost (in fact one plot was pulled out). It has a much more involving and expressive bouquet compared to the Bienvenues. The palate is slightly viscous on the entry countered by a keen thread of acidity, not as tensile as the Bienvenues but surprisingly richer than one would have expected, with traces of wild honey toward the caressing finish. This may well turn out to be the pick of Leflaive's 2016s.",,RP 86
2892,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru, like the other of Leflaive’s grand crus, was affected by the frost. This takes time to open but eventually reveals some lovely yellow flower, flint and oyster shell aromas that gain intensity with aeration. The palate is understated on the entry with a fine bead of acidity, but maybe the Bâtard-Montrachet demonstrated a little more drive and nervosité. There is something sedate about this Chevalier-Montrachet, with a lovely touch of spice on the aftertaste.",,RP 86
2893,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2016 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles offers similar richness to the Folatières but with a hints of Meursault-like nuttiness developing in the glass, plus hazelnut and lychee. The palate is very well balanced with a harmonious texture, a fine bead of acidity, a little spicier than the Folatières though quintessentially Puligny-like on the strict, linear and quite saline finish. Very fine—there is plenty of personality here.",,RP 86
2894,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2016 Bienvenues Batard Montrachet Grand Cru was diminished from 22 to seven barrels this vintage. The bouquet demanded some coaxing from the glass, a little introverted following the Pucelles and Folatières. With time there are fleeting glimpses of wild mint and iodine. The palate is very balanced and harmonious, a pretty and feminine Bienvenues with nicely pitched acidity and a touch of orange peel and white peach toward the saline finish. I suspect it will drink earlier than Leflaive’s other grand crus.",,RP 86
2895,Domaine Leflaive,Pouilly-Fuissé,"The 2016 Pouilly-Fuissé comes from 2.7 hectares of vines around Solutré with one future premier cru (once the classification becomes official). It has a fragrant bouquet with honeysuckle and light chalky aromas, quite elegant although I would be seeking just a little more precision. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, hints of lime and green apple, pretty rather than powerful with a touch of bitter lemon enlivening the finish.",,RP 86
2896,Domaine Leflaive,Auxey-Duresses Blanc,"The 2016 Auxey-Duresses Blanc comes from purchased grapes that are farmed biodynamically and certified, which is why it is labelled Leflaive & Associé instead of Domaine Leflaive. It has a slightly bashful bouquet with orange rind and a welcome touch of blackcurrant. The palate is simple but fresh with a keen line of acidity, a touch of salinité toward the finish of moderate length. It is a little conservative, but that suits it down to the ground.",,RP 86
2897,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2016 Bourgogne Blanc has quite a powerful bouquet with fresh lemon peel and light granitic notes. The palate is well balanced with a slightly oily texture, good acidity, quite powerful with a tangy finish that just needs a little more mineralité coming through.",,RP 86
2898,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Leflaive's 2014 Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru has a compelling bouquet that is full of flint and wet limestone scents, a subtle marine influence (seaweed and cockle shells perhaps?) filtering through with aeration. The palate is very well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, precise and very saline, fanning out with immense precision and poise on the finish. This is one of the standout wines of the vintage.",,RP 86
2899,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Leflaive's 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles, which was the first vintage not bottled under cork (Diam ""D"" to be exact), is quite closed on the bouquet with cold stone and sea cave aromas that blossom with time. The palate is well balanced with a very sappy entry, a fine line of acidity and a crisp, quite spicy and persistent finish. I just think this Caillerets is very backward at the moment and will have more to give once afforded 2-3 years in bottle. This is a scintillating Les Pucelles, and guess what...it's not going to be corked!",,RP 86
2900,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles has an open bouquet that to be honest, feels a little tight-lipped following the more garrulous and expressive Meursault Sous Le Dos d'Ane. There is strictness and conservatism surrounding the nose of this Les Pucelles, but hold on, for after 5-10 minutes it reveals tempting smoke, flint and even a faint scent of wild fennel. The palate is fresh on the entry with crisp acidity. It feels a little spicy on the entry with moderate depth, reserved in style with impressive depth on the finish that just needs to muster a little more nervosité throughout its ageing. Very fine, but certainly a wine that I would keep. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2901,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Batard Montrachet Grand Cru was a wine that did not quite set my world of fire when I tasted it from vat last year when I preferred the Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet. Reacquainting myself with the wine in bottle, I was not convinced to alter that opinion. Leaving it to open for 5-10 minutes in the glass, the grand cru does open up with fresh pear and white peach scents, overtaken by granitic aromas over several minutes. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry with an attractive spicy, white pepper note in the background that comes forward towards the finish that offers commendable weight. What it lacks is just a bit of tension and energy, while I found just as much persistence but no more than the 2014 Les Pucelles. Perhaps it will improve down the line as Bâtard-Montrachet always does, but compared not only to its peers but to the 2015 as well, this just falls a little short. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2902,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"The 2014 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane, which was previously Pinot Noir until it was regrafted with Chardonnay in 1996 and 2000, has a lively, generous bouquet with scents of apricot blossom, peach skin and hints of fresh pear; not as mineral-driven as the Puligny-Montrachet Village, however there is more complexity and charm. The palate is fresh and crisp with a lovely saline note on the entry that neatly offsets the subtle white peach and fresh apricot notes. It has certainly discarded the ""Zen-like"" personality that was conveyed out of tank. There is a seam of spice here that fans out gloriously on the finish. You could actually drink this now and revel in its hubris, though I would advise resisting temptation and cellaring it away for 3-5 years. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2903,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet Village Cru offers lilting dewy green apple and wet limestone aromas on the nose, underneath subtle scents of orange blossom lending more complexity as it opens in the glass. The palate is crisp and fresh with a twist of bitter lemon on the entry. This is well balanced with good weight, plenty of energy on the tip of the tongue with a pleasant saline finish. It does not quite possess the drive of the premier crus, although there is a pleasant spicy note that pops up on the aftertaste. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2904,Domaine Leflaive,Mâcon-Verzé,"The 2014 Mâcon-Verzé was served from magnum, a wine that I do not often taste and I will have to put that right since this has a wonderful, gun flint bouquet that you would immediately nail as Leflaive. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, nice weight in the mouth with hints of Granny Smith Apple and subtle earthy scents towards the finish. If you want a perfect introduction to the winemaking style of the domaine, I would come directly here. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2905,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2014 Bourgogne Blanc has developed nicely during the remainder of its élevage since I tasted it from stainless steel tank, offering apple blossom, flint and smoky scents that possess much more character. The palate is fresh on the entry with citrus peel and fresh Granny Smith, well judged acidity and a bright and lively finish. This is precisely what you want from a Bourgogne Blanc. Tasted December 2016.",,RP 86
2906,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1985 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was poured from bottle whereas the 1985 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet served alongside came from magnum. However, the terroir showed through, and this was probably the better of the two wines. It clearly possessed more intensity than the Bienvenue with scents of struck flint, granite and smoke. There is laser-like precision here. The palate does not disappoint: beautifully balanced with a keen line of acidity that effortlessly offsets the richness and the slight viscosity, especially towards the finish. This is a gorgeous Bâtard-Montrachet, yet another mature white Burgundy that perhaps served as a reminder of the cost of premature oxidation. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 86
2907,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1985 Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru was poured from a magnum following on from their own 2004 Chevalier-Montrachet. Of course, this was the era prior to the introduction of biodynamics. Nevertheless, it boasted a powerful nose with white peach, wild fennel and grass clipping scents, an underlying mineralité that only surfaces after rigorous aeration. The palate is surprisingly opulent and powerful, reflecting the warmth of that growing season. Lovely honeyed notes, a dash of lemon rind and an almost resinous finish complete this delicious Bienvenue. As this was from a larger format, I suspect that bottles may be more advanced, but certainly this was drinking beautifully. Tasted November 2016.",,RP 86
2908,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a powerful but controlled bouquet with scents of dried honey, brioche and orange blossom, a touch of mineralité tucked just behind. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, lively in the mouth with very impressive weight, retaining superb delineation and focus on the gunflint finish that has more to give, and it will with 4-5 years in bottle. This is sophisticated and entrancing. Tasted May 2016.",,RP 86
2909,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières did not reach my estimation from when I tasted this from stainless steel vat. It has an attractive bouquet with cold stone and yellow flower scents developing with aeration. So far so good. The palate is a little shrill on the entry, tense but missing real depth and precision on the finish. This does improve with 10-15 minutes in the glass, gaining a little more tension and personality so perhaps it is simply a case of needing more time. I'll keep the faith and temper more score. Tasted May 2016.",,RP 86
2910,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2000 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles put in an excellent showing, demonstrating that the millennial vintage produced some fine, perhaps overlooked white Burgundies. The nose is quintessential Anne-Claude Leflaive: smoke, gunflint and a slight reductive note. The palate displays impressive weight and cohesion for a 2000 with brisk lime and citrus notes. The precision is maintained from start to finish that feels long and satisfying. Probably à point, this Puligny-Montrachet comes highly recommended. Tasted June 2016.",,RP 86
2911,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2014 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru has a come-hither bouquet that is very immediate: passion fruit, apricot blossom, cold stone and even a faint touch of strawberry winegums. The palate is well balanced with a keen line of acidity, good weight in the mouth with a touch of citrus lemon and lime, but perhaps just needing more complexity and terroir expression to come through on the finish. This is one of the best 2014 Bienvenues that I have come across -- an absolute delight.",,RP 86
2912,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Combettes is much more expressive on the nose, doling out pressed yellow flower scents and apricot blossom -- a very come-hither nose. The palate is very well balanced, lively in the mouth, edgy compared to the Folatières with a primal finish. There is just a touch of shrillness on the aftertaste, but that should dissipate by the time of bottling and leave a very fine Puligny Combettes that should age with style.",,RP 86
2913,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Folatières has a crisp, floral bouquet that takes time to unwind, with hints of chalk dust littered over the bright green apple and fresh pear scents. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry with a keen line of acidity, though it needs to develop a touch more material towards the finish just to fill the wine out a little and create more of a presence.",,RP 86
2914,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2014 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon had a slightly muted bouquet: flinty at first, straight-laced with just a touch of dewy green apple. The palate is fresh on the entry with a bright opening and then it hunkers down towards a more stony, precise, flinty finish. Understated perhaps, but there is good length here.",,RP 86
2915,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bienvenue Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru has a clean bouquet, touches of undergrowth here, perhaps not quite as comely as the 2014 may turn out. The palate is nicely balanced with hints of bitter lemon, striking acidity but showing composure and class on the finish that appears to have retained some of that nascent richness that it showed in barrel.",,RP 86
2916,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2013 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles has more precision and detail than the 2013 Puligny Clavoillon, with hints of pine and undergrowth flanking the citrus fruit and slate aromas. The palate is crisp and fresh with a fine line of acidity, nicely balanced with hints of white peach and nectarine towards the composed and still quite saline finish. Classy and refined.",,RP 86
2917,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2013 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon, which was bottled in June, has a well defined bouquet with flint and light smoky scents with just a hint of quince coming through with aeration. The palate is nicely poised with good weight on the entry, a touch of light honey and mandarin, poised if not persistent on the finish. I would afford this a couple of years in the cellar.",,RP 86
2918,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2005 Montrachet Grand Cru has quite a deep color for a ten-year-old Montrachet. The nose feels a little forward with hazelnut and brioche scents, a touch of warm gravel. The palate is medium-bodied with a touch of shaved ginger, then later rosewater and apricot. This does not have the verve and the nervosité I was expecting, and frankly, it is blown away by Jean-François Coche's 2005 Corton-Charlemagne. That said, it does improve and seems to muster more energy and tension, but if you stripped away the label, I don't think I would be jumping up and down with excitement without knowing how rare or expensive this is.",,RP 86
2919,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Pucelles from Anne-Claude Leflaive has an outstanding bouquet: very well defined, surfeit of mineralité with flinty, smoky notes developing after. There is real intensity and focus here. The palate is clean and fresh, almost clinical, with hints of lime cordial and citrus fruit, a dash of spice on the finish that is long and penetrating. This has a long future ahead - the best showing of Leflaive's 2012s in this blind tasting.",,RP 86
2920,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Combettes is a very subtle one, keeping its cards close to its chest and as such I underestimated this wine. It is showing a lot of new oak on the nose that smothers the terroir delineation after the impressive Combettes 2012 from Jean-Marc Boillot. The palate is phenolic on the entry. There is a lot of substance here but it is quite difficult to discern the finesse. I was just wanting more drive and ambition, and it is only through time that is gradually coalesces and reveals its breeding. Give it two or three more years in bottle. I don't think this is one of the late Anne-Claude Leflaive's best wines of the vintage, but it should repay cellaring.",,RP 86
2921,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières did not show well on this occasion, certainly not as well as some of the other premier crus from this estate. Here it has a slightly withdrawn nose at first, reluctantly opening up with light malic scents that never really get out of second gear. The palate is quite rounded on the entry with orange cordial and a dab of lemongrass, but it needs more tension and detail on the finish. I will need to re-taste this as it was unanimously felt to be well below par.",,RP 86
2922,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Served blind, this bottle of 2006 Bienvenue-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru from Domaine Leflaive was a big disappointment. Color alone raised my alarm - way too deep considering its age. The nose was clearly showing excessive oxidation, whilst the palate had a pleasant waxy texture, but was scuppered by a sense of flatness and enervation. It's the kind of expensive white Burgundy that has put off many of its most ardent and loyal admirers from buying and cellaring the wine that they love. Caveat emptor.",,RP 86
2923,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1999 Bâtard Montrachet Grand Cru from Domaine Leflaive is blessed with a stunning gunflint nose that soars from the glass. It is supremely well controlled and actually shows up the 1999 Chevalier-Montrachet tasted alongside. The palate is rich in the glass with light honeyed tones intermingling with lime, marzipan and citrus lemon. As you would expect, there is superb mineralité locked into this wine, though it is expressed more aromatically than on the palate. Still, it is a deeply impressive wine and it should continue to give pleasure over the next decade at least.",,RP 86
2924,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"Tasted blind at Farr Vintners Kumeu/White Burgundy tasting. The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet Village from the late Anne-Claude Leflaive is reticent on the nose: withdrawn sea spray scents flanked by sherbet and tangerine peel that develop in the glass and lend complexity and vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with a lime cordial-driven entry. This is well balanced with a pleasant fatness to it, subtle tangerine and apricot toward the finish that offers satisfying salinity. This is a fine village cru that should drink well over the next decade.",,RP 86
2925,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"I have not tasted the 2003 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon for a number of years, but looking back, perhaps I was a bit mean in my evaluation. It handles the warmth of that infamous season capably on the nose with light honeysuckle and waxy aromas (not unlike the Nuits Saint Georges Clos de l'Arlot Blanc 2007 tasted alongside.) The palate is medium-bodied with commendable acidity and it comes across more like a very decent Sonoma Chardonnay than Puligny-Montrachet. That's not a criticism, rather an observation. Drink over the next 4 or 5 years.",,RP 86
2926,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Although not quite as ethereal as the 1992, the 1996 Bienvenue Batard Montrachet does not disappoint, and at 18 years young, will continue to offer great pleasure for many years. It has a tangible mineral intensity, just a slight reduction that seems to blow away, followed by fabulous granitic scents that are stern and terse, almost aloof. The palate is underpinned by a killer line of acidity and wonderful salinity. Again, there is just a touch of reduction here, but that does not detract from a magnificent, majestic Bienvenue that is perhaps only just beginning to hits its stride.",,RP 86
2927,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Now 22 years of age, Anne-Claude Leflaive's 1992 Bienvenue Batard Montrachet is still going strong and, given the performance here, you could envisage it continuing along its plateau for another ten years. It has a surprisingly deep color, but don't let that put you off. It has a magnificently detailed oyster-shell bouquet that expresses minerality like few others, a strong marine influence developing all the time in the glass. The palate is beautifully defined with nigh on perfect acidity. It is an intense Bienvenue with subtle white peach and citrus notes toward the ethereal finish. This is utter class.",,RP 86
2928,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Though I have tasted this rarity twice from bottle, this was the first time that I have tasted it from barrel and therefore I have less context than Anne-Claude Leflaive's other crus. What I can say is that the 2013 Montrachet Grand Cru was quite astonishing. Even having just tasted the Chevalier-Montrachet, I have to admit that this was in a totally different league. It simply rockets from the glass with scents of citrus lemon, lemon curd, white peach and shaved almond all beautifully delineated. The palate is an intense ""experience,"" that being the operative word. It envelops the senses, cradles them with citrus scents, almond, limestone and white peach scents, the texture surprisingly rounded but not viscous. With enormous persistence, this is quite a remarkable Montrachet to be.",,RP 86
2929,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2013 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru, like many from this vineyard, has an expressive and, compared to other vintages, you could almost say extravagant bouquet, bridled with intense citrus lemon, freshly sliced pear, limestone and even a faint touch of peppermint. The palate is intense on the entry with more depth than the Bienvenue at this stage. There is a pinch of spice here, shaved ginger adding a bit of fire at the front of the tongue, then attractive stony notes finally revealed on the finish and the aftertaste. Superb - for me perhaps superior to the 2012.",,RP 86
2930,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Combettes might well be the most startling wine from Anne-Claude and her team this year, one that probably transcends this propitious vineyard. It has an expressive set of aromatics like the Folatières, a little more ""fiery"" at this stage perhaps, vivacious and defined with hints of lemon curd and white peach. The palate is voluminous and powerful with superb acidity and great depth. This is a Combettes with a lot of ambition and constitutes one of my favorites from the domaine this year.",,RP 86
2931,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2013 Puligny-Montrachet Village, which sees around 15% new oak, has a fragrant bouquet: apple blossom, touches of peach and yellow plum, quite complex for a village cru. The palate is fresh and malic on the entry with a keen line of acidity. Linear and correct with a slightly abrupt but delineated finish. Very fine.",,RP 86
2932,Domaine Leflaive,Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos d'Ane,"The 2013 Meursault 1er Cru Sous le Dos D’Ane was affected by flowering (though not as poor as in Puligny) plus hail and a low juice-to-skin ratio. It has a lifted bouquet with fresh citrus lemon, white peach and minerals. The palate is fresh and minerally on the entry, actually not too stylistically distant from a Puligny, with a linear, stony, correct finish with a subtle spicy aftertaste.",,RP 86
2933,Domaine Leflaive,Bourgogne Blanc,"The 2013 Bourgogne Blanc has plenty of light citrus fruit and orange blossom scents on the nose. The palate is fresh and clean with crisp lime and green apple notes, leading to a light, easy-drinking finish. Not bad, although I always think that it is worth trading up to the Puligny Village Cru if you must insist on Leflaive on a budget.",,RP 86
2934,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Bâtard-Montrachet 2011 from Anne-Claude Leflaive is slightly deeper in color than its peers. The nose is a little austere at first, but it unfolds nicely with impressive mineral (slate and flint) scents, well defined and poised. The palate is well balanced with a keen thread of acidity. There is a bright citric heart to this Bâtard-Montrachet with fleeting touches of nectarine and citrus lemon joining the edgy mineral finish. This is a classy Grand Cru – regal but not imposing.",,RP 86
2935,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon 2011 from Anne-Claude Laflaive has convincing pedigree on the nose: fine minerality here and impressive delineation, touches of slate unfurling in the glass. The palate has a slightly honeyed entry and it is more exotic than the nose suggests with hints of orange rind and sour lemon dovetailing into lively chalky textured finish. This has great potential, so I would cellar for 2 or 3 years if you can resist.",,RP 86
2936,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles 2011 is rather muted on the nose and remains very reticent. There are light dewy green-apple scents that begin to appear, but it is very stubborn. The palate is crisp and taut on the entry: quite grassy with green apple and kiwi fruit, segueing toward a balanced but tightly wound finish that needs another couple of years to unwind. This is very classy and should age with style.",,RP 86
2937,Domaine Leflaive,Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,"This is a Chevalier-Montrachet that really delivers. The 2002 Chevalier Montrachet has a sensational walnut and smoke-tinged nose that is brilliantly focused and vibrant. This just shimmers with tension and develops hints of cockleshell with time. The palate follows through in style: taut and precise and barely showing its age, deep with great intensity and subtle notes of vanilla pod and coconut toward the finish, though they never obstruct the mineral core of this fantastic Chevalier-Montrachet. Drink now without guilt, cellar for another decade likewise.",,RP 86
2938,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"The 1999 Combettes from Anne-Claude Leflaive is maturing in fine style. It possesses a gorgeous bouquet, albeit once you have allowed some SO2 to dissipate (so I suggest giving it 30 minutes decanting.) The nose offers lime flower, greengage, yellow flowers and a dab of lemon sherbet. The palate is crisp and fresh with light flinty notes and a crisp attack of lime. Perhaps it lacks the length of a truly great Puligny from Anne-Claude, but this is still an impressive Puligny with swagger, verve and a few more years of pleasure up its sleeve. Drink now-2024.  Tasted January 2014.",,RP 86
2939,Domaine Leflaive,Montrachet Grand Cru,"Poured as the opening wine to my trip to Hong Kong, it was doubtful that any white wine I would encounter during my stay would surpass the 1998 Montrachet Grand Cru . It has a spine-tingling, powerful, almost bewildering bouquet that just envelops the senses and knocks you sideways with its untrammeled intensity: yellow flowers, cold limestone and a touch of grilled walnut. The palate is harmonious and powerful with honey-tinged citrus fruit, perfect acidity and a crescendo of flavors that fan out gloriously towards the finish. It is difficult pinning down specific flavors here - it is more a sensation than a wine. Drink now-2025+",,RP 98
2940,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru,"A friend from New York approached me with this obscure, doubtlessly never to be seen again, wine from Leflaive: a non-vintage bottling of Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru purportedly originating from the 1950s. How was the wine? Oh, pretty rubbish and oxidized as it turns out, but at least you know it exists. Tasted November 2013. ",,RP 98
2941,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Bienvenue-Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru possesses a wonderful, complex bouquet with orange zest, apricot blossom, minerals and white peach that wafts enticingly from the glass, gathering momentum with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with a crisp, effervescent entry. The mineral-core is more pronounced here than the premier crus, with a taut piercing finish that feels very persistency in the mouth. Superb. 

Anne-Claude Leflaive made a brief appearance during my tasting at the domaine since she was hastening off to Italy. I have been visiting here for as long as I can remember, first meeting former winemaker Pierre Morey in the 1990s. Back in those days, the tenets of biodynamism were evident, although back then I did not really understand them. Today, there is almost evangelism towards Steiner’s philosophy, not in a monomaniacal sense, rather a strong belief that Anne-Claude’s wines would be pale shadows without them. Parking outside their gates, it was good to be back after a three-year absence. Nothing much had changed. On this occasion it was Antoine Repetit de la Bigne who escorted me down to the stainless-steel vats where the final blends were resting prior to bottling, which is where I always taste. I wondered whether finally I would hear “Oui” when I ask whether I could taste their single barrel of Montrachet? I decided not to ask. That would be rude. Antoine told me that the harvest began on September 14 and everything was picked by September 21. Of course, I had to bring up the topic of hail damage. Antoine explained that here it was de facto the second hail storm on August 1 that inflicted the most damage, particularly on their parcels of village cru. In the end, Leflaive ended up losing approximately half their crop depending up the vineyard. “Fortunately it was just before veraison so the berries did not have a lot of juice in them,” Antoine informed me, clambering up the ladder to dip his pipette into another vat. “Curiously, even the big berries had little juice. It was important to apply the treatments quickly so that the vines do not become stressed and retard the vegetative cycle. We used nettle and velarian (a source of phosphorous) that were both very effective. Then when it came to sorting, the vibrating table de trie was crucial.” Many of the treatments had to be done on foot, much to the chagrin of the team plodding through the vines in their heavy muddy boots. Usually for the last three years it has been horses hooves in the vineyard. However, in 2012 it was found that two human legs were better than four equine ones. It is always an intellectual as well as satisfying sensory exercise tasting through Anne-Claude Leflaive’s wines. It always serves as a lesson in terroir expression: same grape, same approach. As so often I find, those not wishing to spend too much money ought to head directly from their village cru, their Puligny-Montrachet one of the finest you will find in Cote de Beaune. Beyond that, well each year springs up a different premier cru that catches you off guard. Myself, I was taken with stunning Les Pucelles due to its precocity and intensity that lifted it equal to the grand crus. Others might prefer something subtler. I do not think Anne-Claude wines are beyond criticism. Sometimes the aura that veils the estate and Anne-Claude herself, creates a shield so that they are impermeable to dissenting comments. Biodynamics itself has never precluded an intrinsically superior wine to one where a load of chemical was dumped onto the vineyard. The question is more: if given the choice, which would you prefer to put in your mouth?  Antoine hands me a copy of his paperback entitled “What’s so Special About Biodynamic Wine.” I read the chapter on wine critics on the way home. I agree with him that we should strive to taste as much as possible at the domaine, but at the end of the day, a biodynamic wine should not be critiqued with preferential treatment. Whether Anne-Claude Leflaive’s Chevalier-Montrachet is biodynamic or not is irrelevant. I am more interested in its intrinsic qualities vis-a-vis their Les Pucelles or Bienvenue, vis-a-vis the Chevalier-Montrachet from Alain Chavy, Jean Chartron, Etienne Sauzet or Michel Niellon. And the Chevalier-Montrachet here is a sublime expression of the vineyard no doubt destined to age with grace and style. That is what matters. You may have noticed there is no Montrachet note here. The reason is not personal. Just that there is so little that it is being matured in a specially made small barrel, which renders the elevage extremely sensitive and fragile (see Frederic Barnier’s comments about his Criots-Batard-Montrachet.) I would not want to ruin what little there is for the sake of vanity.

2942,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2012 Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru has a laconic stony, mineral bouquet with sea spray scents surfacing with time. The palate is very well-balanced with crisp acidity although at the moment the Bienvenue shows a little more finesse and precision. After five minute, there is a touch of spice that becomes more accentuated with time. As usual for this vineyard, it is reticent at the moment, perturbed why someone would awake it from its prenatal slumber, but this will be fascinating to watch age.

Today, there is almost evangelism towards Steiner’s philosophy, not in a monomaniacal sense, rather a strong belief that Anne-Claude’s wines would be pale shadows without them. Parking outside their gates, it was good to be back after a three-year absence. Nothing much had changed. On this occasion it was Antoine Repetit de la Bigne who escorted me down to the stainless-steel vats where the final blends were resting prior to bottling, which is where I always taste. I wondered whether finally I would hear “Oui” when I ask whether I could taste their single barrel of Montrachet? I decided not to ask. That would be rude. Antoine told me that the harvest began on September 14 and everything was picked by September 21. Of course, I had to bring up the topic of hail damage. Antoine explained that here it was de facto the second hail storm on August 1 that inflicted the most damage, particularly on their parcels of village cru. In the end, Leflaive ended up losing approximately half their crop depending up the vineyard. “Fortunately it was just before veraison so the berries did not have a lot of juice in them,” Antoine informed me, clambering up the ladder to dip his pipette into another vat. “Curiously, even the big berries had little juice. It was important to apply the treatments quickly so that the vines do not become stressed and retard the vegetative cycle. We used nettle and velarian (a source of phosphorous) that were both very effective. Then when it came to sorting, the vibrating table de trie was crucial.” Many of the treatments had to be done on foot, much to the chagrin of the team plodding through the vines in their heavy muddy boots. Usually for the last three years it has been horses hooves in the vineyard. However, in 2012 it was found that two human legs were better than four equine ones. It is always an intellectual as well as satisfying sensory exercise tasting through Anne-Claude Leflaive’s wines. It always serves as a lesson in terroir expression: same grape, same approach. As so often I find, those not wishing to spend too much money ought to head directly from their village cru, their Puligny-Montrachet one of the finest you will find in Cote de Beaune. Beyond that, well each year springs up a different premier cru that catches you off guard. Myself, I was taken with stunning Les Pucelles due to its precocity and intensity that lifted it equal to the grand crus. Others might prefer something subtler. I do not think Anne-Claude wines are beyond criticism. Sometimes the aura that veils the estate and Anne-Claude herself, creates a shield so that they are impermeable to dissenting comments. Biodynamics itself has never precluded an intrinsically superior wine to one where a load of chemical was dumped onto the vineyard. The question is more: if given the choice, which would you prefer to put in your mouth?  Antoine hands me a copy of his paperback entitled “What’s so Special About Biodynamic Wine.” I read the chapter on wine critics on the way home. I agree with him that we should strive to taste as much as possible at the domaine, but at the end of the day, a biodynamic wine should not be critiqued with preferential treatment. Whether Anne-Claude Leflaive’s Chevalier-Montrachet is biodynamic or not is irrelevant. I am more interested in its intrinsic qualities vis-a-vis their Les Pucelles or Bienvenue, vis-a-vis the Chevalier-Montrachet from Alain Chavy, Jean Chartron, Etienne Sauzet or Michel Niellon. And the Chevalier-Montrachet here is a sublime expression of the vineyard no doubt destined to age with grace and style. That is what matters. You may have noticed there is no Montrachet note here. The reason is not personal. Just that there is so little that it is being matured in a specially made small barrel, which renders the elevage extremely sensitive and fragile (see Frederic Barnier’s comments about his Criots-Batard-Montrachet.) I would not want to ruin what little there is for the sake of vanity.

2946,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2004 Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru from Anne-Claude is creamy, generous and lightly honeyed, but in my opinion is in want of more terroir expression and delineation. It actually seems quite advanced for its age and status. The palate is powerful and quite viscous in the mouth with vanilla and honey notes, but again, it does not really express what Batard is all about. For sure, a pleasurable wine, but it is missing intellectual rigor. Drink now-2017.",,RP 98
2947,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Things go up a notch or two with the 2010 Bienvenues-Batard-Montrachet, which appears to hover on the palate with the grace of a ballerina. The Bienvenues is all about weightless elegance and implied structure, but it is all there in the glass. At times a bit intellectual, the Bienvenues is nevertheless immensely appealing. Layers of soft, perfumed fruit flow effortlessly to the nuanced, feminine finish. A hint of floral honey and almonds lingers on the palate. I can’t wait to see how this ages. Anticipated maturity: 2020+.  

Estate Manager Eric Remy has one of the sharpest memories of anyone I have ever met. His recall of specific dates and events is quite remarkable, so I will take advantage of that in reporting a very complete picture of the 2010 growing season. Accoring to Remy, in order to gain some insight on 2010, one has to start with the brutal frost of December 19, 2009, when temperatures dropped to a bone chilling -20C/-4F after having hovered around freezing for a few days prior. The very next day, temperatures shot up to 10C/50F. January was quite dry. A bit of snow fell in early February, but the rest of the month was dry. The last frosts at the domaine were recorded from March 10-14. The weather improved in April, especially towards the end of the month. May and June were cold. Flowering in the domine’s vineyards started on June 5th and ended between June 20 and 22. The first part of July was hot but stable, while the second part of the month was cold and humid. Unstable conditions persisted throughout August. A hailstorm with heavy thunder in Santenay on September 12 was a sign harvest time was approaching. A bit of botrytis was recorded on September 17. The harvest started on September 20. Yields came in around 45 hectoliters per hectare, pretty much in line with 2009, the only domaine I visited where that is the case.

2948,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 2010 Batard-Montrachet covers every inch of the palate with fruit. In 2010, the Batard is towering, statuesque and simply impeccable. Today the aromas and flavors are not at all developed, rather the wine is really all about textural elegance and finesse, and there is plenty of that here. A huge, explosive finish rounds things out in style. The Batard is a wine of contrasts. At times it is quite bold and extroverted, at others it possesses admirable restraint. Either way, it is magnificent. Anticipated maturity: 2020+.

2949,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The 2010 Puligny-Montrachet Pucelles is a totally complete wine. It brings together the expressive bouquet and minerality of Combettes with some of the expressive fruit of the Folatieres. Vivid and multi-dimensional in the glass, the Pucelles wraps around the palate with serious intensity. Citrus, white flowers and green pears linger on the highly nuanced, refined finish. Today, though, the 2010 is incredibly tight. Its pedigree is impossible to miss. Leflaive’s Pucelles is easily one of the highlights of the vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.

Today it appears to lack some mid-palate depth and concentration, but that may come as the wine fleshes out with further time in bottle. Even though it is quite beautiful from a textural standpoint, the Chevalier is the least expressive of the grand crus. With time in the glass, gorgeous floral notes and hints of honey blossom as the Chevalier shows off its sensual personality and beautifully layered fruit. Anticipated maturity: 2020+.

The fruit is quite bold and racy, something that is only accentuated over time as the wine opens up in the glass. At the same time, underlying veins of minerality begin to appear, providing the perfect foil to the wine’s increasingly tropical tendencies. I imagine the richer, more exotic notes will only intensify over time, yet there is plenty of acidity to support the fruit.

2961,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clavoillon,"The 2009 Puligny-Montrachet Clavoillons emerges from the glass with plenty of sweet, caressing fruit. I especially like the way this blossoms on the mid-palate, while remaining relatively hushed. This understated Clavoillons impresses for it balance and sheer harmony. The integration of fruit, acidity and structure is terrific. Anticipated maturity: 2012+.

This is a pretty, understated wine, but there is little of the radiance or exuberance of the year in the glass.

2966,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles,"The Leflaive 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles offers minerality, finesse, and lift that leave behind its premier cru siblings. Seductive lily, heliotrope and iris along with high-toned herbal and pit fruit essences on the nose find their counterpart in wafting, bitter-sweet perfume and pure essence of peach and quince on a silken palate. There is a Chevalier-like sense of salt and stone shimmering through curtains of fruit in the finish. But the appropriateness of diaphanous metaphors here should not mislead one into suspecting a lack of concentration. In the end, this is implacably persistence, encompassing a tactile dimension to its sense of chalkiness. Hints of honey and toasted almond well up as this takes on air, suggesting an additional dimension of future richness. I expect this will reward revisiting for a decade.  

Departing from the script of most vignerons I visited, Leflaive cellar master Eric Remy (who took over last year from Pierre Morey, with whom he has worked for several years) claimed his 2007 fruit – which he began picking September 1 – harbored a 2:1 ratio of tartaric to malic acidity (whereas, he adds, it was close to reversed in 2006). While some crop was lost to hail – particularly in Chevalier-Montrachet – Remy did not think this affected quality, and he had the same attitude toward mildew (combated here with biodynamic methods), which he said did not compromise the fruit. Alcohol levels largely hover below 14%, that is to say lower – regardless of cru – than any of the 2006s.

2967,Domaine Leflaive,Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The Leflaive 2007 Bienvenues-Batard-Montrachet smells of lily, heliotrope, and narcissus, white peach, pineapple, and toasted nuts. With infectious primary juiciness of ripe fruit accompanied by liquid floral perfume on the palate, and transparent to saline and chalky nuances, this is creamy and rich without sacrificing refreshment or a sense of lift and delicacy. For all of its alluring perfume and suggestions of sweetness, the finish here is remarkably dominated by saline, stony, and savory yet still mineral characteristics. This is a bit less dynamic than the Pucelles but at least for now richer. It strikes me as another candidate for a decade of enjoyment.

2968,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Pineapple, mandarin; hibiscus and orange blossom mark the nose of the Leflaive 2007 Batard-Montrachet. Honey, bittersweet citrus oil, marmalade, apricot preserves, and liquid floral perfume create a sense of seductive ripeness matched by textural opulence. But this lacks the nuance, lift, or intriguing mineral dimension of the Bienvenues-Batard or the Pucelles. A pungent smokiness clings to its bittersweet finish. I imagine this being slightly less age-worthy than the two aforementioned crus, but only time will tell.

2969,Domaine Leflaive,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"Leflaive’s 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Les Folatieres represents a major step up in concentration over the wines that proceeded it in this year’s line-up. Ripe, faintly caramelized peach, quince preserves, citrus zest, and brown spices dominate the nose and succulent, creamily-textured palate. Musky notes of narcissus and heady lily-like perfume add allure and complexity, following all the way through the finish. At the same time, this is anything but heavy, evincing a sense of buoyancy that beautifully compliments the wafting floral character of its long finish. This refined Puligny sublimates any overt mineral character in the interest of seduction, of which it should remain fully capable for at least the next 6-8 years.

There is a sultry suggestion here, but pleasing, and not the actual hint of heat that was noticed in the Clavoillon. This too should be worth following for at least 6-8 years.

The combination of (metaphorically) warm ripeness and lush texture with overt mineral notes is unusual and fascinating, and there is satisfying if not especially dynamic persistence.

Lush and lusciously fruited on the palate it combines apple, peach, and melon with a pungently bitter-sweet suggestion of orange marmalade. With less lift and refreshment and a touch of warmth vis a vis other wines in this group, it partly compensates by dint of sheer richness of flavor and texture.

We opted for an extended elevage, to get the noses to express themselves and the bodies to fill out.” According to Morey, all of the domaine’s Puligny parcels were struck by hail, having lost 20% of their production of Folatieres, slightly less in other parcels. Yields, though lower than in both 1999 and 2000, came in between 40 and 45 hectoliters per hectare, after the work on the sorting tables.

This wine is certainly one of the finest 1997s produced in the Cote de Beaune.  It offers fresh yet immensely ripe aromas of pears, apples, red berries, and candied almonds.  On the palate, it reveals massive breadth, spectacular refinement, as well as huge concentration and complexity. Toasted white fruits, lemons, currants, hazelnuts, salt, and minerals can be found in its highly defined and extracted personality.  This is quintessential Montrachet, combining the density, ripeness, and richness of a Batard, with the elegance, precision, and purity of a top-flight Chevalier.

Anne-Claude Leflaive, this famed estate's director, and Pierre Morey, its winemaker, are justifiably excited about their 1996s. Some of their lots had 14% natural alcohol potential, yet huge acidity levels. Morey said that the malic and tartaric acid levels were even at harvest, an unprecedented occurrence in a ripe vintage in Burgundy. Like his colleagues at other domaines, he attributes the high levels of malic acid to the cool temperatures that were present in late summer and early fall. Madame Leflaive added that the estate's policy of hoeing the vineyards forces the vine's roots deep into the soil also increases acidity levels.

Regrettably, few wine lovers will ever have the opportunity to taste this rare gem as only 25 cases were produced. White flowers and deeply imbedded honeysuckle and minerals provided a gustatory overload. The mouth possesses amazingly elegant, yet intense, gorgeous candied fruit notes revealing an awesome minerally sweetness as well as a judicious touch of oak.

The Domaine Leflaive has enjoyed many successful vintages over the years - 1979, 1985, 1986, and 1989 come to mind immediately - but the 1992s are the finest young wines this domaine has produced.  Yields averaged 45 hectoliters per hectare, far below most recent vintages.

This exceptionally elegant, vividly fresh wine has drunk well since it was bottled.  Its attractive nose of lemon rind, herbs, and grilled nuts is reminiscent of a top Meursault.  The characteristic Leflaive elegance, medium-bodied weight, and excellent richness and purity are all apparent.  1985 was a highly successful vintage for the Domaine Leflaive, which is admirably reflected by this offering.  It should drink well for another 5-6 years, but why wait?",,RP (91-94)

This is one of those rare examples of a 1983 that is formidably powerful as well as young and backward.  I do not know how Leflaive achieved such a monstrous-sized wine that has remained so fresh and unevolved for nearly a decade.  Although I have seen more evolution in the last 24 months than I did in the wine's first 7 years of life, it still needs at least 2 more years of cellaring.  A huge wine by Leflaive's standards, and more massive and alcoholic than the domaine would prefer, it has turned out to be one of the great 1983s.",,RP (91-94)

Fading quickly, Leflaive's 1982 Batard-Montrachet was more enjoyable during its first 5-6 years of life.  It has now lost much of its graceful bouquet and the fruit appears to be drying out.  What remains is a relatively acidic, lean wine.  This performance may be typical of Leflaive's other 1982s.  About six months ago I had their 1982 Puligny-Montrachet-Les Pucelles (which I had loved when it was young) and found it to be flat and disappointing.",,RP (91-94)

The 1979 white burgundy vintage has turned out many fine wines.  They were gorgeous young and have generally evolved gracefully.  Because they were so precocious and tasty when released, I initially thought they would be short-lived.  The best examples have not only aged beautifully, but they have developed far more complex aromatics than the more heralded 1978s.  This offering, which displays a beautiful nose of honey, oranges, flowers, and apples, is medium-bodied, with freshness, rich fruit, and a crisp, long finish.  Although it has been drinkable since the early eighties, it is exhibiting no signs of decline.",,RP (91-94)

In contrast to the always charming, delicious, and complex 1979 Les Pucelles, I am still waiting for the 1978 to open.  It remains acidic and concentrated, as well as hard and herbaceous to smell and taste.  This can be a stunning white Burgundy vintage, but many wines have been stubbornly slow to blossom.",,RP (91-94)
3072,Domaine Leflaive,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1989 Batard-Montrachet is more developed, richer, and intense than even the 1989 Chevalier-Montrachet.  In a decade, the Chevalier will be the better wine.  The Batard possesses a gorgeous aroma of oranges, flowers, butter, and minerals.  In the mouth, it is pure buttery fruit supported admirably by crisp acidity and a deft touch of toasty new oak.  A big wine by the Leflaive's standards, it should drink magnificently for at least 10-12 years.

Although Leflaive's 1989s are top-notch, they are not as dramatic as one would expect from a vintage with the taste profile of 1989.  I am not even sure if Leflaive's 1989s are as brilliant as their 1985s or 1986s.

In the case of the Domaine Leflaive (a reference point for all who cherish the finest in Chardonnay) that personality is one of uncompromising elegance, finesse, and purity of flavor.  Anyone who has visited Leflaive has seen more water hoses than owned by the local fire department.  Why?  This is a domaine maniacal about pristine conditions in the cellars.  The results, even in lighter vintages such as 1987, are admirable.  The finest wines, of course, are the grands crus, but the biggest sleepers of the firm are the delicate Puligny-Montrachet-Les Pucelles and the fatter, richer, more husky Puligny-Montrachet-Les Combettes.

The Domaine Leflaive has enjoyed many successful vintages over the years - 1979, 1985, 1986, and 1989 come to mind immediately - but the 1992s are the finest young wines this domaine has produced.  Yields averaged 45 hectoliters per hectare, far below most recent vintages.  The wines are renowned for their purity and elegance, but the 1992s also display a special level of richness and intensity.

3087,Domaine Didier Dagueneau,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"Millionaires should have fun debating whether the 1992 Batard-Montrachet or Chevalier-Montrachet is superior.  The Batard is the more evolved and precocious of the two.  Both are beautifully well-knit, expansively flavored, full-bodied, super-concentrated white burgundies that display honeyed, orange, roasted nut, overripe apple-scented noses, buttery, creamy textures, super extraction of flavor, and long finishes.  The Batard exhibits more mineral scents in its nose and flavors, and is more upfront. The Chevalier-Montrachet appears to be holding more in reserve than the Batard. The Chevalier explodes on the back of the palate and looks to have greater longevity.

In terms of marrying power with finesse, the Puligny-Montrachet-Les Pucelles is a classic.  The 1992 is richer and more unctuous than usual.  It possesses fabulous clarity and definition, a great bouquet of oranges/tangerines combined with toasty vanillin, buttered popcorn, and apple scents.  Sensationally concentrated, with layers of flavor beautifully buttressed by vibrant acidity, this is a magnificent wine.

3089,Domaine Didier Dagueneau,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes,"Followers of the Domaine Leflaive know that for the money, the estate's Puligny-Montrachet-Les Combettes is the wine to buy. This vineyard, situated next to the great Meursault vineyard Les Charmes, is as much of a Meursault as it is a Puligny-Montrachet.  The wine's formidable nose of grilled hazelnuts, butter, steel, and flowers is mindblowing.  Huge, unctuous, thick, chewy flavors exhibit magnificent extraction of flavor.  There is enough acidity to provide definition to this wine's sizeable components.  The finish is rich, long, and mouthfilling.  It should drink gorgeously for the next decade.  Les Combettes represents the more lusty, hedonistic side of the Leflaive portfolio.

This exceptionally elegant, vividly fresh wine has drunk well since it was bottled.  Its attractive nose of lemon rind, herbs, and grilled nuts is reminiscent of a top Meursault.  The characteristic Leflaive elegance, medium-bodied weight, and excellent richness and purity are all apparent.  1985 was a highly successful vintage for the Domaine Leflaive, which is admirably reflected by this offering.  It should drink well for another 5-6 years, but why wait?",,RP (91-94)

This is one of those rare examples of a 1983 that is formidably powerful as well as young and backward.  I do not know how Leflaive achieved such a monstrous-sized wine that has remained so fresh and unevolved for nearly a decade.  Although I have seen more evolution in the last 24 months than I did in the wine's first 7 years of life, it still needs at least 2 more years of cellaring.  A huge wine by Leflaive's standards, and more massive and alcoholic than the domaine would prefer, it has turned out to be one of the great 1983s.",,RP (91-94)

Fading quickly, Leflaive's 1982 Batard-Montrachet was more enjoyable during its first 5-6 years of life.  It has now lost much of its graceful bouquet and the fruit appears to be drying out.  What remains is a relatively acidic, lean wine.  This performance may be typical of Leflaive's other 1982s.  About six months ago I had their 1982 Puligny-Montrachet-Les Pucelles (which I had loved when it was young) and found it to be flat and disappointing.",,RP (91-94)

The 1979 white burgundy vintage has turned out many fine wines.  They were gorgeous young and have generally evolved gracefully.  Because they were so precocious and tasty when released, I initially thought they would be short-lived.  The best examples have not only aged beautifully, but they have developed far more complex aromatics than the more heralded 1978s.  This offering, which displays a beautiful nose of honey, oranges, flowers, and apples, is medium-bodied, with freshness, rich fruit, and a crisp, long finish.  Although it has been drinkable since the early eighties, it is exhibiting no signs of decline.",,RP (91-94)

In contrast to the always charming, delicious, and complex 1979 Les Pucelles, I am still waiting for the 1978 to open.  It remains acidic and concentrated, as well as hard and herbaceous to smell and taste.  This can be a stunning white Burgundy vintage, but many wines have been stubbornly slow to blossom.",,RP (91-94)
3112,Domaine Didier Dagueneau,Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1989 Batard-Montrachet is more developed, richer, and intense than even the 1989 Chevalier-Montrachet.  In a decade, the Chevalier will be the better wine.  The Batard possesses a gorgeous aroma of oranges, flowers, butter, and minerals.  In the mouth, it is pure buttery fruit supported admirably by crisp acidity and a deft touch of toasty new oak.  A big wine by the Leflaive's standards, it should drink magnificently for at least 10-12 years.

Although Leflaive's 1989s are top-notch, they are not as dramatic as one would expect from a vintage with the taste profile of 1989.  I am not even sure if Leflaive's 1989s are as brilliant as their 1985s or 1986s.

All of the great Burgundy domaines have a certain signature to their wines that is more recognizable than any perceived terroir character.  In the case of the Domaine Leflaive (a reference point for all who cherish the finest in Chardonnay) that personality is one of uncompromising elegance, finesse, and purity of flavor.  Anyone who has visited Leflaive has seen more water hoses than owned by the local fire department.  Why?  This is a domaine maniacal about pristine conditions in the cellars.  The results, even in lighter vintages such as 1987, are admirable.  The finest wines, of course, are the grands crus, but the biggest sleepers of the firm are the delicate Puligny-Montrachet-Les Pucelles and the fatter, richer, more husky Puligny-Montrachet-Les Combettes.
