0,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is drinking with some generosity despite its youthful age, offering up aromas of bee pollen, clam liquor, waxy citrus and crisp stone fruit, followed by a medium to full-bodied, broad and muscular palate with an ample core of fruit framed by chalky structuring extract, concluding with a long, resonant finish.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
1,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Irancy,"Dauvissat's 2007 Irancy is drinking well, offering up aromas of dark berries, cherry pit and Agen prune, followed by a medium to full-bodied, deep and attractively chewy palate that's characterfully rustic, in a style typical of the appellation.",2007 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Irancy,RP 95
2,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2022 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses unwinds in the glass with aromas of oyster shell, orange blossom, warm stones and subtle hints of citrus oil—this cuvée is almost always more about rocks than fruit. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and electric, it's racy and tensile, with a long, resonant finish.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
3,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Deeper-pitched than the ethereal Preuses, the 2022 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos exhibits aromas of ripe citrus fruits, peach, white flowers, beeswax, nutmeg and clam broth. Full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, it's textural and layered, with a deep and muscular core, concluding with a long, expansive finish.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
4,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"A brilliant wine in the making, Dauvissat's 2022 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest unfurls in the glass with youthfully reductive scents of citrus oil, crisp stone fruit, white flowers, oyster shell and subtle hints of orange blossom. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, with superb depth at the core and an electric finish, this cuvée has navigated the vintage's extremes with ease.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
5,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2022 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet unwinds in the glass with aromas of crisp stone fruits, ripe lemons, white flowers, clear honey and subtle hints of warm spices. Medium to full-bodied, cool and satiny, the vintage has lent this a gracious charm that isn't always typical of young Séchet, but the wine's searingly mineral signature remains front and center.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 95
6,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"Bursting with notes of white flowers, orange zest, nutmeg and iodine, the 2022 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons is medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with bright acids and a long, expansive and perfumed finish. As ever, its expressive, charming style makes it something of the more-mineral Séchet's alter ego.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 95
7,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Aromas of pear, Myer lemon, green apple, clam liquor and white flowers preface Dauvissat's 2022 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre, a medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny wine with a textural attack that segues into a bright, mineral mid-palate, concluding with a saline finish.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 95
8,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"The 2022 Chablis exhibits scents of white peach, oyster shell and white flowers mingled with subtle hints of nutmeg and youthful reduction. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, it's concentrated and racy, concluding with a long, precise finish.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 95
9,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"Exhibiting aromas of sweet stone and orchard fruit mingled with lemon oil and clay liquor, Dauvissat's 2022 Petit Chablis is medium-bodied, ample and fleshy, with lively acids and a mouthwateringly mineral finish.",2022 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 95
10,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2021 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is bright and aromatic, bursting with notes of white flowers, crisp orchard fruit, nutmeg, iodine, clear honey and oyster shell. Medium to full-bodied, racy and incisive, with a charming core of expressive fruit and a long, perfumed finish, this is already quite open out of the gates for a young Dauvissat Preuses in a cooler vintage.",2021 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
11,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2021 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest is a young classic, mingling scents of sweet citrus oil and peach with notions of white flowers, struck match, bee pollen and youthful reduction in an incipiently complex bouquet. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and textural, it's concentrated, taut and incisive, with a long, mineral finish.",2021 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
12,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"Aromas of white flowers, orange oil, clear honey and oyster shell introduce the 2021 Petit Chablis, a medium-bodied, taut and chiseled wine with a tangy spine of acidity and a mineral finish that will delight Chablis purists.",2021 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 95
13,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"I generally have a slight preference for Dauvissat's Les Preuses, a preference I suspect Vincent Dauvissat shares, but the 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos, at least at this early stage, gets my nod as the king of the cellar—and the wine of the vintage. Wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus oil, fresh bread, oyster shell, white flowers and wet stones, it's full-bodied, layered and textural, with huge concentration, racy acids and a long, resonant finish.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
14,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"Offering up aromas of orange oil, white peach, jasmine, oyster shell, wet stones and struck flint, the 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is full-bodied, ample and layered, with terrific concentration, racy acids and a long, intensely mineral finish. As ever, this wine is more floral-mineral than it is fruity, standing out for its ethereal personality in contradistinction with the blockier, more muscular Les Clos.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
15,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"A striking young wine, Dauvissat's brilliant 2020 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest unfurls in the glass with aromas of crisp orchard fruit, orange oil, pear, oyster shell, freshly baked bread and smoke, framed by a deft touch of reduction. Medium to full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, it's taut and concentrated, with racy acids, chalky structuring and a long, searingly mineral finish. Recent years have delivered so many brilliant renditions of La Forest that it's hard to pick a favorite between the likes of 2008, 2014, 2017 and 2019, but the 2020 is certainly a worthy entrant into the competition, and it's worth a special effort to seek out.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
16,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2020 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet is brilliant, mingling aromas of crisp green apple and lemon oil with notions of oyster shell, freshly baked bread, white flowers and wet stones. Medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, it's racy and tensile, with tangy acids and a long, searingly mineral finish.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 95
17,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"As is almost invariably the case, Dauvissat's 2020 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons is sensual and perfumed, wafting from the glass with aromas of orange oil, peach, jasmine and nutmeg. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, it's vibrant and fleshy, with an ample core of fruit, racy acids and a long, saline finish.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 95
18,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The seventh and greatest vintage from this vineyard that Dauvissat has produced to date, the 2020 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre unwinds in the glass with notions of peach, crisp orchard fruit, white flowers, freshly baked bread and nutmeg. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional, it's deep and complete, with racy acids, chalky grip and a long, penetrating finish.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 95
19,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"Dauvissat's 2020 Chablis bursts with aromas of crisp green apple, white flowers, wet stones, oyster shell and struck match. Medium to full-bodied, taut and racy, it's deep and incisive, with impeccable Chablisien credentials and a long, intensely mineral finish. As usual, it's the reference point for the appellation.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 95
20,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"Brimming with character and complexity, Dauvissat's 2020 Petit Chablis transcends its humble appellation. Offering up aromas of crisp green apple, citrus zest, oyster shell and mandarin orange, it's medium to full-bodied, taut and chiseled, with racy acids and a pungently saline finish.",2020 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 95
21,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Vincent Dauvissat's 2004 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is evolving very slowly, unwinding in the glass with notes of citrus oil, beeswax, iodine and crisp orchard fruit. Full-bodied, layered and vibrant, with chalky structure and racy acids, it's still a few years from real maturity.",2004 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
22,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"The 2019 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is, if anything, more introverted than Les Preuses this year. Mingling notes of citrus oil, pear and crisp stone fruit with hints of fresh bread, vanilla pod and wet stones, it's full-bodied, layered and muscular, with huge concentration, framed by chalky extract and lively acids. Concluding with a long, saline finish, it will require considerable patience.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
23,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2019 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is brilliant, unwinding in the glass with notes of oyster shell, orange blossom, iodine, wet stones and freshly baked bread. Full-bodied, deep and tightly wound, with racy acids, chalky structuring extract and an incredibly intense, pungently saline finish, this is a magical young wine from Dauvissat.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
24,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2019 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest is the deepest and most complete of Dauvissat's premiers crus, delivering a complex bouquet of orange oil, pear and fresh bread complemented by top notes of iodine, dried white flowers and beeswax. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, it's layered and concentrated, with superb mid-palate volume, lively acids and a long, electric finish.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
25,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2019 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet opens in the glass with scents of citrus oil, white flowers, beeswax, oyster shell, wet chalk and mandarin. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and strikingly intense, it's taut and chiseled, with tangy acids and huge reserves of concentration, concluding with a pungently chalky finish. As I've written before, Séchet—where Dauvissat owns a 0.8-hectare parcel—is located in the Vaillons Valley, but its windier situation and soils richer in active limestone mean it's typically more tensile and incisive than the other climats that make up Vaillons.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 95
26,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2019 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre is the sixth vintage that Dauvissat has produced of this climat, and he observes that it's one of the few parcels he exploits that isn't planted with the family's proprietary massale selections. Exhibiting notions of citrus oil, fresh bread, iodine and warm pastry, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and lively, with fine tension at the core and a long, mineral finish. It's the most approachable while young of these premiers crus.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 95
27,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2019 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons is one of the more expressive wines in the range at this early stage, wafting from the glass with notes of lime zest, crisp stone fruit, freshly baked bread and subtle hints of nutmeg. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and precise, it's a lively, penetrating wine that will offer a broad drinking window. The Vaillons comes from holdings where the soils are deeper than in Séchet, and that shows in greater textural plentitude.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 95
28,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"Introducing the 2019 Chablis are aromas of beeswax, dried white flowers and oyster shell dominating youthfully discreet notions of citrus oil and fresh bread in an already complex bouquet. A medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping wine, this is fleshier and more textural than its Petit Chablis counterpart—though it's just as chiseled—concluding with a long, saline finish.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 95
29,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"The 2019 Petit Chablis has turned out brilliantly, wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus oil and white flowers, mingled with classically Chablisien hints of oyster jus and Parmesan cheese rind. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, it's deep and unusually concentrated, with tangy acids and a long, intensely saline finish. As usual, it's ""Petit"" in name only, surpassing many other producers' grandest bottlings.",2019 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 95
30,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Aromas of pear, green apple and citrus oil mingling with hints of fresh bread and oyster shell introduce Dauvissat's 2018 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos, a full-bodied, layered wine that's ample and elegantly muscular, girdled by bright acids and revealing more overt structure than Les Preuses at this stage. Concluding with a long, chalky finish, even in the demonstrative 2018 vintage, this will merit a bit of patience.",2018 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
31,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2018 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses has turned out brilliantly, delivering notes of orange oil, crisp orchard fruit, iodine, white flowers and oyster shell, followed by a full-bodied, ample and enveloping palate that's racy and saline, concluding with a long, electric finish. This is rather open for a young Dauvissat Preuses; and while it should, all things being equal, enjoy a long life, it will be less of a crime than usual to open a bottle or two young.",2018 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
32,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"While much commercial Chablis is utterly predictable, Vincent Dauvissat's old-fashioned, artisanal wines are anything but: their phases of evolution and the way they respond to oxygen are unlike almost anything else in the region. The 2005 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest proves that point perfectly. On opening, mature aromas of honeycomb and marzipan suggest the wine might be tiring, but the longer the bottle is open, the younger the wine seems, its bouquet segueing into a mélange of citrus oil, dried white flowers and oyster shell, relegating those notions of honeycomb and marzipan to the background. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with a powerful, layered core that's structured around notable dry extract and ripe but tangy acids, concluding with a long, beautifully defined finish. As the wine ages, it is more marked by producer and vineyard than it is by its vintage signature, which is another recurring theme when tasting Dauvissat's wines.",2005 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
33,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Drunk from magnum, Vincent Dauvissat's 1997 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos put on a stunning showing, and clearly ranks as one of the true sleeper vintages for this great estate. Bright and lively in hue, the wine unfurls in the glass with a classic bouquet of citrus oil, oyster shells, dried orange peal, oatmeal and gentle leesiness that's still youthful, with little of the mushroomy, honeyed qualities that typically characterize mature Chablis. On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and muscular, with a deep, layered mid-palate, ripe but racy acids and plenty of chewy extract, concluding with a long, beautifully defined finish. While the 1997 is not as searingly incisive as the more famous 1996, it is less of a high-wire act and may prove the better balanced wine in the long term. While this magnum in the town of Chablis was still youthful, I suspect 750-milliliter bottles in export markets are fully mature, and there's no reason not to open bottles.",1997 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
34,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"This bottle of Vincent Dauvissat's 1996 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest was the finest I have ever encountered and fully realized the immense but seldom actualized potential of the vintage, wafting from the glass with a complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, oyster shell, oatmeal, dried white flowers and subtle top notes of honeycomb and smoke. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and broad but immensely incisive, its satiny attack segueing immediately into a deep and concentrated mid-palate that's built around a searingly racy spine of acidity, concluding with a strikingly long, penetrating and sapid finish. Most remarkably, the longer the 1996 Forest sits in the glass, the younger it seems! While this vintage is plagued by bottle variation, premature oxidation and cork issues throughout Burgundy, there are few finer things in the world of wine than a pristine bottle of the 1996 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest. Having burnt through numerous flawed bottles of this very wine, I feel compelled to attach a point of interrogation to this lavish score, but the rating reflects my experience on this occasion.",1996 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
35,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"From a bottle that had never left the village, Dauvissat's 1989 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is extraordinary, blossoming in the glass with notes of buttered lemon, confit orange, oatmeal, dried white flowers, beeswax and warm straw. Full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, it's a layered, textural wine that's elegantly muscular, marrying a ripe and concentrated expression of fruit with a powerful mineral undertow. Long and saline, this is one of the finest mature Chablis that I have tasted.",1989 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
36,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 1976 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet put on a stunning performance, far surpassing my comparatively conservative expectations for a vintage that is seldom notably exciting in white Burgundy. Wafting from the glass with aromas of tangerine, yellow apple, oatmeal, fresh field mushrooms and clear honey, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and incisive, with a concentrated, chiseled core and a long, mineral finish. It was so good that I accounted for the better part of the bottle myself while my friends were distracted by a two-year-old Meursault Perrières.",1976 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 95
37,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2018 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest is also showing well, opening in the glass with aromas of crisp green orchard fruit, citrus oil, beeswax, honeycomb and oyster shell. Medium to full-bodied, layered and textural, it's fleshy and enveloping, with a lovely spine of acidity and a long, saline finish. Like the Vaillons, this is quite demonstrative for a young Dauvissat Forest, and it will deliver considerable pleasure straight out of the gates.",2018 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
38,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of golden orchard fruit, honey comb, confit citrus, oatmeal and crisp green apple, Dauvissat's 2018 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons is medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a generous core of fruit, lively acids, and a long, saline finish. This is an unusually demonstrative, fruit-driven Vaillons from Dauvissat, though it does retain plenty of Chablisien character.",2018 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 95
39,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"The 2018 Chablis is showing very well, offering up a pretty bouquet of citrus oil, crisp orchard fruit, oatmeal and beeswax. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and charming, built around ripe but lively acids and concluding with a delicately saline finish. Unusually youthfully charming and open-knit for a Dauvissat Chablis, while remaining very true to the appellation and the domaine's style, this will drink well comparatively young.",2018 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 95
40,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"Vincent Dauvissat's 2017 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is extraordinary, blossoming in the glass with aromas of orange blossom, smoky oyster shell and wet stones, followed by a full-bodied, satiny and searingly chalky palate that's strikingly multidimensional, pure and precise, with a bright spine of acidity and a long, resonating finish. From barrel, I described this wine as the ""essence of rocks,"" and from bottle, I wrote exactly the same words.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
41,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"More muscular and enveloping than the Preuses, Dauvissat's 2017 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos unfurls in the glass with aromas of ripe lemons, confit citrus, pastry cream and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional, with a rich, structured but incisive profile and a long, chalky finish. If Les Preuses is the more intellectual of the two grand cru bottlings, Les Clos is the more direct and easy to understand.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
42,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"A brilliant rendition of Vincent Dauvissat's emblematic premier cru, the 2017 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest reveals a complex bouquet of oyster shell, crisp green apple and lemon oil mingled with notes of dried white flowers and freshly baked bread. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and complete, with a deep and concentrated core, striking energy and cut and a long, mineral finish. Amounting to some 4.5 hectares, La Forest accounts for a third of the domaine's surface area, so it will be the easiest Dauvissat wine for readers to find. Happily, it ranks alongside the 2014 and 2008 as one of the very best of recent years.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 95
43,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"A bottling that regularly excels chez Dauvissat, the 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet opens in the glass with delicate aromas of citrus peel, grapefruit, crisp green apples and white flowers, with only subtle hints of the oyster shell to come. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, with a deep and tight-knit core, striking tension and a searingly mineral finish. Séchet—where Dauvissat owns a 0.8-hectare parcel—is located in the Vaillons Valley, but its windier situation and soils richer in active limestone mean it's typically much chalkier and more tensile than the other climats that make up Vaillons.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 95
44,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre is a bottling that debuted in 2013, and the Dauvissat family lost some 25% of their crop to hail this year. Unfurling in the glass with notes of honeyed peaches, crisp green apples, citrus oil and pastry cream, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny, with a layered core that's more structured and tighter-knit than the Vaillons that preceded it, concluding with a chalky finish.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 95
45,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"Aromas of fresh peach, white flowers and mint introduce the 2017 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons, the most expressive and outgoing wine in Dauvissat's 2017 collection. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and supple, with an elegantly textural attack, a layered core and a saline finish. If any readers intend to drink their Dauvissat premiers crus in the flush of youth, this is the bottling they should seek out.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 95
46,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"The 2017 Chablis is simply superb and about as fine an example of the appellation as it's possible to find. Offering up aromas of white currants, citrus oil, spring flowers and oyster shell, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and layered, with superb concentration and cut, concluding with a long and lingering finish. Dauvissat explained that most of the vines that produce this cuvée face his holdings in La Fôret.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 95
47,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"Readers who neglect Vincent Dauvissat's 2017 Petit Chablis in favor of his grander appellations will be doing themselves a disservice, as this is a brilliant, characterful wine with an established track record of evolving gracefully for the better part of two decades. Unfurling in the glass with scents of lemon oil, white flowers and crushed chalk, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with a bright spine of acidity and a precise finish. Dauvissat observed that, unusually, all his appellations attained the same maturity levels in 2017, so the Petit Chablis has the same alcohol level as his two grand cru bottlings.",2017 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 95
48,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"From bottle, the 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is more immediately expressive than the Preuses, revealing aromas of honeyed lemons, preserved citrus and quince. On the palate, it's fuller-bodied, deep and ample, even rich, with a layered core, succulent acids and almost chewy levels of extract, concluding with a long finish. It's a very serious Les Clos that could well be the wine of the vintage.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 95
49,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"From bottle, the 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is the most reticent wine in the cellar, unfurling slowly with aromas of orange blossom, oatmeal, wet stones and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, tense and stony, with excellent depth and dimension. It's not as lively or intense as the 2017 rendition, but it's a very serious wine that will demand some bottle age before it reveals all its plenitude.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 95
50,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest is superb, wafting from the glass with aromas of Meyer lemon, iodine and wet stones. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and pure, with satiny textural gloss, excellent concentration and a beautifully delineated finish. I suspect this will be a comparatively precocious rendition of the Dauvissat Forest, but it's a beautiful wine.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
51,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet is one of the high points of the range chez Dauvissat this year, unfurling in the glass with notes of lemon oil, caramelized citrus rind, dried white flowers and smoky reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and layered, with chewy extract and an intensely mineral, chalky quality. It's structurally quite tight-knit and will demand some time.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 93
52,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons hails from a parcel that's a mere 400 meters away from the domaine's holdings in Séchet, yet the wines are worlds apart. The Vaillons exhibits a muskier bouquet of orange blossom, peach and honeycomb, followed by a medium to full-bodied, pure and textural palate that's expansive and open-knit. It's more immediately charming, while the tighter-knit Séchet will need more time.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
53,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"Notes of lemon oil, pastry cream, oystershell and blanched almonds introduce the 2016 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre, a fine-boned, medium-bodied wine with good tension and cut but which lacks the depth and concentration found in the Vaillons and Séchet this year.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
54,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"The 2016 Chablis Villages is very good, unfurling in the glass with aromas of honey, preserved citrus, oatmeal, oystershell and subtly smoky reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, with tangy acids. It's not as pure and incisive as the greatest Dauvissat vintages, but it would be difficult to find a better Chablis AOC bottling in 2016.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 93
55,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"The 2016 Petit Chablis is an impressive achievement in a challenging vintage, offering up notes of green apple, iodine and honey. On the palate, it's medium-bodied and more gourmand than the 2017 rendition, with more flesh on its bones and less cut and tension, concluding with a saline finish.",2016 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 93
56,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"From barrel and from bottle, the 2014 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest struck me as the best rendition of this bottling I had ever tasted, and it enjoyed a brief window of accessibility for six to eight months after it was released. Today, however, the wine has shut down hard, unfurling reluctantly in the glass with a reticent but immensely promising bouquet of salty oystershells, green apple, lemon oil and dried white flowers. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and racy, with a deep but tight-knit core, tangy balancing acids and a long, searingly saline, mineral finish. To give close Dauvissat followers an idea of the wine's style and structure, this Forest combines the harmony and completeness of the 2002 vintage with some of the cut and salinity of the 2008 vintage—an undeniably winning combination. It should come into its own at age ten and drink well for the following two decades.",2014 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
57,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"Surprisingly, the 2011 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is somewhat more supple and open-knit than the corresponding La Forest, offering up pretty aromas of orange blossom, citrus zest, oystershell, iodine and pastry cream. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly glossy and delicate, with a tangy, saline profile and a detailed finish. This is a precocious Preuses that's already approachable.",2011 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 93
58,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Like many wines from this initially tight-knit vintage, the 2010 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos from Vincent Dauvissat is drinking surprisingly well, unfurling in the glass with notes of honeycomb, lemon oil, wheat toast, mandarin and oystershell, framed by subtly smoky reduction that dissipates with aeration. On the palate, it's full-bodied, concentrated and multidimensional, with considerable mid-palate depth and dimension married with incredible crystalline purity and stony tension. The finish is long and precise.",2010 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 93
59,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"I rank Vincent Dauvissat's 2008 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses as one of his greatest hits, and it's a wine I can never resist ordering whenever I encounter it. This bottle did nothing to dissuade me of my opinion, unfurling in the glass with a stunning bouquet of lemon oil, mandarin, honeycomb, dried white flowers and almond paste, complemented by classy top notes of iodine and salty oystershell. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and layered, with incredible concentration and intensity, a racy line of acidity and a long, stony finish. It's a Preuses that stands out for its combination of texture, intensity and weightlessness, and while it's still youthful, it is drinking superbly already. Writing this note, I'm already salivating for the next bottle.",2008 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 93
60,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2002 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest offers up a lovely bouquet of orange blossom, iodine, blanched almonds, lemon oil and fresh field mushroom. On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, with stunning purity and completeness, a deep, crystalline core and a long, stony finish. This is a sublime Forest from one of Vincent Dauvissat's all-time greatest vintages, a year that is always striking for its ineffable sense of harmony and elegance at this address.",2002 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
61,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2011 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest is still a touch closed for primetime drinking, but it’s a great success in this sometimes rather diffuse Chablis vintage and is a classic rendition of the Domaine’s emblematic cuvée. Aromas of lemon oil, oyster shell and dried flowers precede a medium-full, concentrated and precise wine, with an ample mid-palate, zest acids and a typically chalky finish.",2011 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
62,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"Served blind, the 2001 Chablis 1er Cru La Forest stood out for its atypical nose, lent an exotic glaze by the botrytis so typical of this vintage in Chablis. Notes of burnt orange, wheat toast, honey and preserved lemon precede an intense, vibrant wine with lovely intensity, a bright line of acidity and a taut, electric finish.",2001 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
63,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses has a very mineral drive and stony bouquet that to all intents and purposes I guess has not budged one iota since being opened two days prior to my visit. It is beautifully defined and understated with precise yellow flower and flint-like scents. The palate is succinctly balanced with a fine thread of acidity, a more feminine and elegant les Preuses compared to the 2016, but very long and utterly refined on the finish. This fulfills all that promise it showed in barrel.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,RP 93
64,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru la Forest has a seductive bouquet of toffee apple, quince, flint and touches of apricot blossom developing over time all with superb delineation. The palate is very well balanced with outstanding energy and tension, perhaps waxy in texture and with a slow burning build that leads to a vibrant quince, marmalade and white pepper finish that seems to lacquer the mouth. What a great Forêts, even if the 2016 is showing even greater potential.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
65,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Séchet fulfills the tremendous promise that it demonstrated in barrel last year. It has an expressive bouquet with scents of wild honey and a touch of petrol, leaning a little towards Riesling in style but with marvelous delineation. The palate is nervous and tensile, shimmering with energy which is quite amazing considering that 2015 was not supposed to have a high-acidity finish. The aftertaste is so mineral driven that the Séchet momentarily transports you to the vineyard. This comes highly recommended: an intellectual Chablis that should mature with style.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,RP 93
66,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The 2015 Chablis 1Er Cru Vaillons was more closed than the Séchets at this point in time, gradually revealing scents of white citrus fruit, nectarine, beeswax and flint, those aromas drawing you in with each swirl of the glass. The palate is very harmonious with a honeyed opening, very concentrated with dried honey, quince and a ravishing ginger and lemongrass-tinged finish that lingers long in the mouth. As usual, this is a flattering Vaillons but that would be to overlook the complexity and precision within.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
67,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,"The 2015 Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre has a strict and linear bouquet with gorgeous scents of lemon curd, quince and slate. It is perhaps less open than the Vaillons but it gains intensity in the glass, aeration accentuating those slate-like aromas. The palate is more low-keyed compared to other premier crus, but still fresh and tensile with a waxy, almost Rhône-like, marzipan-tinged finish that lingers. It is a fine 2015 but in this vintage I feel it is surpassed by the Vaillons and the Séchet.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre,RP 93
68,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"The 2015 Chablis has a honeyed bouquet with flecks of white chocolate. As the aromas unfold there is a seam of lemon curd and a distant scent of chalk dust. The palate is well balanced with superb salinity considering the warmth of the growing season; vibrant and quite deep toward the poised finish. It seems to have lost some of its nascent spiciness from barrel, yet there is unquestionably impressive body and concentration, suggesting it will age with style.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis,RP 93
69,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Petit Chablis,"The 2015 Petit Chablis has a ripe, slightly leesy bouquet that is quite Meursault-like in style. The palate is focused, linear and very fresh with touches of oyster shell and dried quince. It is quite long and persistent on the finish. To quote myself from when I tasted this in barrel, it is a not-so-Petit Chablis.",2015 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Petit Chablis,RP 93
70,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Brouilland. The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru la Forest has a clean, fresh and vibrant bouquet with plenty of citrus fruit combining nicely with slate and flinty notes. Très Chablis! The palate is well balanced with a crisp line of acidity, nicely integrated oak that lends weight, smoke and walnut surfacing towards the finish that feels persistent. This is certainly one of the better Chablis in 2013 and it was no surprise it came from Vincent Dauvissat. Tasted May 2016.",2013 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
71,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"The 2002 Chablis Grand Cru les Clos was served blind by Vincent Dauvissat after I had tasted through his 2015s. All I can say is thank you. I was slightly out regarding the vintage, suggesting it might be a 2001. It has a deceptively rich and honeyed bouquet, with hints of pralines and even marzipan. There is beautiful delineation here, so wonderfully focused and lavish. The palate follows suits with a viscous honeyed entry, deeply layered with grilled almond and dried honey notes that are offset by a killer line of acidity. This is utterly sublime and my only regret is that I could not stay and watch it blossom in bottle. Well, I hope Vincent enjoyed it for his supper.",2002 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 93
72,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"This wine was tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chablis 1Er Cru Vaillons from Dauvissat-Camus aka Vincent Dauvissat, did not show as well as previous bottles because of the sulfur, which tends to trip you up - especially in blind tastings. What comes across as a rather dull sample vis-à-vis its peers, is simply a Chablis that constantly demands extended aeration, preferably a dozen years in the cellar! I'll refrain from marking this for now.",2012 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,RP 93
73,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The 2012 Chablis 1er Cru la Forest from Vincent Dauvissat has a lovely nose, a little more tropical than I remember it, with touches of guava and pineapple infusing the citrus fruit, subtle marine influences developing with aeration in the glass. The palate is fresh on the entry with a nice touch of bitter lemon, moderate weight in the mouth with a honeyed seam emerging toward the finish. It takes a little time to enter its stride, but it is certainly worth the wait.",2012 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,RP 93
74,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The 2011 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos  has an initially quite simple bouquet, but one that gains complexity with salted caramel, almond and smoke scents, well defined and gaining vigor with aeration. The palate is crisp and focused on the entry with a fine line of acidity and minerality, although it feels quite austere toward the razor-sharp finish. This is another Dauvissat wine that has completely closed down now, and I expect my parsimonious score will be made to look foolish down the line.",2011 Domaine Vincent Dauvissat Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,RP 93
75,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The 2013 Chablis 1er Cru Sechet has a strict but mineral-drenched bouquet that shows enormous potential. The palate already demonstrates immense clarity with a surfeit of energy and beguiling touches of pure orange zest on the finish. Watch out for this once released! 

Raveneau or Vincent Dauvissat? Cognoscenti seem to be split about which of these growers represent the pinnacle of Chablis, though frankly I would not complain if I found either in my glass. I have adored these wines for many years, though this was the first time that I had visited their small 16th and 17th century cellars. Vincent’s grandfather was one of the first to bottle his own wines in the 1930s, then Rene took over with his wife Madeleine and enhanced the domaine’s reputation until his retirement. Vincent told me that the first vintage that he participated in was the 1977 and that know-how had been passed down through empiricism, from father to son and so on. There are around 14 hectares of vine, predominantly premier cru. The 2012s bestowed a normal crop in terms of quantity, although 2013 was down to around 28 hectoliters per pectare, though Vincent emphasized that this was not catastrophic. “The crus had the same analysis in 2012. The terroir making the difference,” he said. He used around 10% to 15% of new oak, the rest a mixture of aged wood. Unsurprisingly, these were a set of quite sublime expressions of Chablis that leave you questioning whether it’s worth bothering with the rest of the tastings (which of course it is, but you know what I mean when you taste something that you are convinced will not be bettered.) These Chablis seem to be sculpted by the earth itself, exquisitely balanced and with more minerality than almost all of their peers. Even the village cru would leave other premier crus behind. The 2013s were unfortunately in an awkward stage, although I had a chance to taste a couple from barrel. I look forward to tasting them on my next visit.

76,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2012 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses has a nose that strides out of the blocks and takes charge over those premier crus. Real mineralite here – you can smell that Kimmeridgian! The palate is extremely well-balanced with razor-sharp acidity you could cut your finger on. Beautifully poised with bags of spice on the finish, this is one powerful Les Preuses – one of the finest grand crus of the vintage. Drink now-2025.

77,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"The 2012 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos, which comes from 1.7 hectares of 50+-year-old vine, has a much subtler bouquet compared to Les Preuses with hints of yellow flowers and damp autumnal undergrowth. The palate is extremely well-balanced with a touch of dried apricot and peach skin on the entry before being usurped by gentle spicy notes that lead to the tense finish. This is a lovely Les Clos, although Les Preuses is more exciting this year. Drink now-2022.

This 1994 would appear to be at its apex. Wonderful. Drink now. 

Raveneau or Vincent Dauvissat? Cognoscenti seem to be split about which of these growers represent the pinnacle of Chablis, though frankly I would not complain if I found either in my glass. I have adored these wines for many years, though this was the first time that I had visited their small 16th and 17th century cellars. Vincent’s grandfather was one of the first to bottle his own wines in the 1930s, then Rene took over with his wife Madeleine and enhanced the domaine’s reputation until his retirement. Vincent told me that the first vintage that he participated in was the 1977 and that know-how had been passed down through empiricism, from father to son and so on. There are around 14 hectares of vine, predominantly premier cru. The 2012s bestowed a normal crop in terms of quantity, although 2013 was down to around 28 hectoliters per pectare, though Vincent emphasized that this was not catastrophic. “The crus had the same analysis in 2012. The terroir making the difference,” he said. He used around 10% to 15% of new oak, the rest a mixture of aged wood. Unsurprisingly, these were a set of quite sublime expressions of Chablis that leave you questioning whether it’s worth bothering with the rest of the tastings (which of course it is, but you know what I mean when you taste something that you are convinced will not be bettered.) These Chablis seem to be sculpted by the earth itself, exquisitely balanced and with more minerality than almost all of their peers. Even the village cru would leave other premier crus behind. The 2013s were unfortunately in an awkward stage, although I had a chance to taste a couple from barrel. I look forward to tasting them on my next visit.

83,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"The Vincent Dauvissat 2011 Chablis Sechet delivers a striking sense of lift and transparency allied to infectious juiciness. Succulent and refreshing grapefruit, lime and yellow plum are wreathed in buddleia and high-toned herbal extracts, then mingled on a buoyant (almost delicate) and silken-textured palate with the saline-sweet savor of raw scallop. The saliva-inducing, umami-rich animal aspects are perfectly complemented by almost infinite juiciness of citrus and pit fruits that are transparent to seductively floral and shimmeringly crystalline-mineral nuances. This long-finishing beauty should not be missed now, in its youth, but I imagine it will continue to cast its spell through at least 2018.  

Vincent Dauvissat emphasizes the positive roll of rain in September, 2012: ""it permitted fruit maturation to continue, and ameliorated acidity."" The most vexing parts of the vintage, as he perceives it, were frost and mildew, and he has the low yields to show for the battle with them. Poor flowering, he acknowledges, had its positive sides in engendering loose, rot-resistant clusters and helping to insure that even in those vineyards not frosted, the crop was able to thoroughly ripen. Dauvissat was quick to point out that when it came to his two grand crus, 2011 represented another short crop, because those sites bloomed during a period of perturbing weather; whereas conditions turned favorable in the week that followed, in time for flowering in his premier cru and village-level sites. Harvest dates here were pretty typical: the first half of September in 2011, and the last week of September and first few days of October in 2012. Finished alcohols in 2012 range from 12.5%-13%; and a half a degree lower in 2011. Like me, Vincent Dauvissat thinks that many observers are misled by the youthfully generous and lightweight character of the 2011s into a false belief that they won't be worth cellaring. (That being noted, I hasten to add - chastised by prematurely oxidized bottles, including even a few from his hand - that my notion of felicitous aging involves a shorter temporal horizon than his.)

There is an overt, succulent fruitiness of ripe apple and white peach here that one scarcely anticipates from any generic Chablis, complemented by smoky nut oils, a distinct and invigorating nip of fresh ginger, and a more predictable rivulet of fresh lime. Sleek and buoyant, this ""little"" Chablis proves transparent to considerable chalky and crystalline mineral nuance not to mention tinged with saliva-liberating salinity in a prolonged and stimulating finish. Plan to savor it through 2015, and perhaps beyond.

87,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"The 2010 Chablis Preuses is a dense, structured wine bursting with fruit. The typical Preuses bouquet is very much present, but today the wine is young and needs time to settle down. This is a decidedly bold, ripe Preuses that captures the weight and richness of the year. Although insanely vivid and beautiful in the glass, it still needs time to fully come together. Today, the minerality appears nearly buried by the sheer density of the fruit. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.  

Vincent Dauvissat brought in his 2011s beginning on September 1st. Dauvissat likes the vintage, comparing it to 2009, but with a little more verve. For the first time malos were done by Christmas, which Dauvissat attributes to the precocious personality of the vintage. I tasted all of the 2011s from barrel, where they were aging on their fine lees after having been racked once. Dauvissat talks about the 2010 harvest as having two components. The fruit he brought in early had notable maturity and considerable concentration because of the tiny yields, while the fruit that came in after the September rain had a little bit better overall balance, which is to say alcohols around 12.5% and acidities that ranged from 6-7%, versus 13.5% and 7.5%, alcohol and acidity respectively, for the fruit harvested first. As a comparison, overall acidities for the 2011s were around 4%, significantly lower than 2010. Dauvissat told me his father planted the family’s vineyards with rootstocks that encourage early maturation, and that is a key in understanding many vintages at the domaine, including 2010, when an irregular flowering lowered yields dramatically. In 2010, the earlier flowering parcels got the worst of the bad weather, while the parcels that flowered later did better as the weather turned warmer and more stable at the most critical time. Overall yields were down approximately 40%. Sechets and Vaillons were also hit by frost.

This is another superb, incisive 2010 from Dauvissat. I also tasted the 2002, which is just entering its early maturity. As delicious as it is, I don’t expect the 2002 Forest to be extremely long lived by the estate’s standards. Anticipated maturity: 2015+.

This is an especially big, almost opulent style – within the context of Chablis. Waves of fruit build effortlessly to the juicy, intense finish. The Sechet is a hugely rewarding wine to enjoy now and over the next decade or so. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2021.  

Vincent Dauvissat’s 2010 harvest started on September 21st, a few days earlier than his average over the last ten years, which has been closer to September 25th. The vintage is marked by very low yields. Couleur and millerandage were most pronounced in the grand crus, where yields were 40% lower than normal. At the same time, the wines have retained plenty of acidity, making for very interesting personalities across the range. The 2010s were aged in oak (roughly 10% new), on their fine lees, and racked once after the malos, which were finished by the end of January. The Forest, Preuses and Clos saw some new oak during the alcoholic fermentation. Dauvissat planned to begin bottling the 2010s in October or November, 2011. In 2009, Dauvissat harvested a week earlier, starting on September 14. Vintage 2009 was marked by a hot August that resulted in ripe wines with acidities that are lower than normal. Within the context of Chablis, where acidity is rarely lacking, a warm yet well-balanced season can be a good thing in that the wines are easier to drink when young, which certainly appears to be the case here.

100,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"I tasted Dauvissat’s 2008 Chablis Les Clos assembled from tank very shortly before bottling, where it demonstrated a remarkably dense yet buoyant layering of citrus, quince, white peach, and formidably concentrated chalk, oyster shell, and iodine minerality. Citrus rind, quinine and fruit pit bitterness help extend a cleansing, gum-adhering, electrically charged, practically searing finish that foreshadows at least 15 years of glory, provided premature oxidation does not lay it low, something no one can predict, and which the track record at this address renders unlikely but unfortunately by no means unthinkable. About the prowess of this wine over the next half dozen years, though, as well as about that of Les Clos the site, I am left in no doubt by my present experience.

Vincent Dauvissat points out that at least at his estate, 1996 was at once more severe yet more alcoholic and more exotic in aroma than what he terms the “more classic” vintage of 2008. Both years featured long cool growing seasons and wind-driven concentration in the late innings, but the fruit in 2008 was cleaner, and entirely botrytis-free, Dauvissat maintains. He says his 2008s come closer in character to 2002. (Incidentally, at age six months, Dauvissat’s 2009s showed promising vivacity and mineral inflection for their vintage.)

101,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"Rene Dauvissat’s 2008 Chablis La Forest achieves a remarkably vibrant sense of interplay and complexity characteristic both for its vintage and for this cuvee at its best. Scents of iris, white truffle, crushed chalk, saline-alkaline ocean breeze, tart plum, white peach and grapefruit all have their counterparts in a palate performance of riveting interactivity and prodigious yet continually fascinating length. There is a firm feel, brightness, and in the end a tendency for its mineral aspects to slightly dominate this show that result in a sparer impression than the corresponding 2007, something of a reversal of these vintage’s normal roles. Once again, here is an exceptional Chablis premier cru that should be worth following for a dozen or more years.

Tart grapefruit and lime zest and a sense of raspberry seeds lend invigoration to the long finish. Here is one 2008 that does put me in mind of a cross between the same cuvee in each of the preceding vintages. I would expect this to perform beautifully for at least 6-8 years but would not want to miss out on savoring some young.

103,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis,"Vincent Dauvissat’s 2008 Chablis evinces that illusive and seductive saline, sweet savor of scallops I associate at this address especially with Sechet and Preuses.  A wealth of marine elements is in fact present already in the nose, together with grapefruit and tangerine that deliver luscious juiciness on the palate. The generous fruit perfectly complements the wine’s mineral dimensions, which combines levity and almost vibratory energy with density. This remarkable example of its modest appellation may well grow in the bottle and certainly should perform well for 4-5 years.

Mysteriously marine though almost severe in its concentration and piquancy, this will need at least a couple of years in bottle to properly prove itself and show a more generous side. It’s certainly formidable already now, and I would not be surprised to see it reveal close to a decade’s stamina.

106,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"Early comparison of Vincent Dauvissat’s 2007 Chablis Preuses with his Les Clos is bound to flatter the former, as here is the essence of that mysteriously scallop-like, sweet, saline savor and a ravishing alliance of richness and textural creaminess with delicacy and refreshment such as you won’t often, if ever, find in another vineyard. Fresh lime, distilled herbal essences, orange oil, iris-like perfume, and honey waft from the nose; through a supremely elegant and dynamic mid-palate; to a finish that soars. No doubt 12-15 years of delight await those lucky enough to score some of this. 

Incidentally, this clearly blessed vineyard parcel lies between one of the two owned by Fevre and La Moutonne. Vincent Dauvissat (whose father Renee’s name has been removed from that of the domaine, a fact I neglected to reflect in my Issue 179 coverage) harvested between September 11 and 21 a crop entirely in keeping with his estate’s awesome track record. But things were not looking good, he says, until the north wind arrived to banish incipient botrytis and permit felicitous, healthy concentration. Hail trimmed some of his crop of generic Chablis and Vaillons, but left the foliage unscathed, he reports, so that fruit maturation was not retarded. The premier crus came in at not much over 12% natural alcohol and were lightly chaptalized, more to extend their fermentations, insists Dauvissat, than to boost body.

Suggestions of white truffle and iris waft ethereally throughout, while subtle suggestions of toasted nuts, iodine, clam liquor, and fruit pit add underlying, persistent piquancy. And for all of this wine’s energized and rarified nature, as well as its overt mineral character, it also evinces a subtle and winsome hint of creaminess. This is about as nuanced and rivetingly multi-faceted as premier cru Chablis gets, and it even tasted this way right off the bottling line! Expect at least a decade of enthralling pleasure and intrigue here.

It also displays a mollusk broth like dimension, here allied to sense of weight and sheer extract that none of the premier crus in this collection can claim. Hints of lanolin and vanilla make one aware of the barrel presence, and a toasted nut element helps lend a sense of richness as well as piquancy to what is otherwise a decidedly mineral-dominated as well as formidably long finish. It’s hard to imagine this (by Dauvissat’s own admission) massively dense wine ever achieving the elegance or mystery of the La Forest – let’s see in a few years – but as an expression of Kimmeridgian essence, it’s quite an achievement, and one sure to merit a dozen or more years’ attention.

Hints of bitter-sweet licorice and black fruits as well as invigoratingly saline and citrus zest notes add further allure. A shimmering exchange of bright citrus and myriad herbal, floral, and crystalline mineral notes makes for a lingering finish which, along with this wine’s combination of flavor concentration and delicacy, puts me in mind a bit of a great Riesling.

Honey-glazed, gingered lime, tangerine, pineapple, and yellow plum are lusciously allied on the palate with a sense of crushed stone and chalk I imagine straining through my teeth. Predictably, this is more adamant in its mineral character, more compact, and more overtly extract rich than the corresponding Sechet. But what it lacks in interplay or levity vis a vis that wine, it at least in part makes up for in layered density and sheer grip.

Surprisingly, it is brighter in acids than the Petit Chablis (thanks presumably to the latter’s later harvest); firmly textured yet by no means deficient in underlying richness; and offers a dynamic interaction of citrus, flowers, and saline, stony mineral nuances that remind me of great Riesling as well as of Chablis with far higher pedigree. Persistently herbal and floral notes mingle with blond tobacco, toasted almond, and savory mineral elements in a long finish. The longer this takes on air, the more interesting and succulently savory it becomes, and one can anticipate at least 4-5 years of such satisfaction.

113,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"From cask, Dauvissat’s 2006 Chablis Preuses smells of toasted grain, roasted nuts, pungent buckwheat, ripe peach, high-toned floral perfume suggesting gentian, and ocean breeze. An amazing depth of indescribable minerality – approximating meat stock and crustacean reduction, with suggestions of soy – saturates the palate, leading to a generous yet still mysteriously savory, mouth-watering finish that contrasts dramatically with the chalky, faintly bitter character of the La Forest. This should become an extraordinary example of terroir and minerality within the context of enveloping richness, and of richness without the least bit of heaviness, and should mature excitingly for the next 12-15 years. Not that I would feel any compunction about pulling a cork now. “Compulsion” would be a better word for what I would feel if I were sitting on bottles of this gem! Exotically ripe, honeyed, almost buttery in texture, yet with palate-nipping hints of botrytis, the 2005 Preuses finds room for some mysterious, savory mineral nuances as well, but is not in the exalted class of this 2006. 

Vincent Dauvissat’s 2006s were finished with both alcoholic fermentation and malolactic transformation by January.

After the welcoming richness and savory expressions of Chablis character in the Preuses, this wine displays a cool restraint and stony minerality. A fascinating wealth of floral and herbal nuances on the nose similarly infuse a mouth-filling, satiny, yet firm palate, accompanied by grapefruit, orange, gooseberry, white peach, cyanic hints of fruit pit, and chalk, and leading to a finish of extraordinary, subtle persistence. This formidably dense Chablis should be permitted several years of bottle evolution, and should then drink well for more than a decade. The 2005 is creamy, honeyed, malted, and amazingly concentrated, with hints of exotic fruits and bitter cyanic notes – an extravagantly, colorfully impressive Les Clos, if not quite at the quality level of the 2006.

115,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"Given the impressive abundance of hard-to-name mineral characteristics exhibited even by the generic wines in this collection, it comes as little surprise that Dauvissat’s 2006 Chablis Sechet is a stunner. Haunting notes of bitter-sweet iris, orange blossom, sea breeze, and lobster shell reduction rise from the glass. In the mouth, this combines seductive richness with lift and transparency to mineral and floral nuance, and the finish weaves a complex lace of ineffable (saline, chalky, ore-like?) mineral matter over a luscious grounding of ripe peach, honeydew melon, and citrus. It should delight over the next 5-7 years.  The floral, saline 2005 is well-concentrated and admirably clear, if marginally less impressive than this 2006.

116,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The Dauvissats’ 2006 Chablis La Forest (a.k.a. “La Foret” a.k.a. “La Forets”) smells effusively of peony, citrus, and peach. It is strikingly bitter-sweet in its alternation of peach and citrus with peach kernel-like cyanic bitterness; displays deep chalkiness; and finishes with amazing grip and length. Past the nose, this is one of the least generous of 2006 Chablis, being remarkably tight and for a young 2006, but very impressively concentrated. The 2005 rendition was almost severe in its concentration, yet also very impressive. It should merit following for 10-12 years, and is probably best rested for a year or two. The 1999 tastes glorious, and youthful today; the still almost sharply-citric 1996, like liquid chalk and white truffle.

117,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The Dauvissat 2006 Chablis Vaillons leads with citrus and spice, gooseberry and peach kernel, backed by chalky and iodine-like expressions of minerality. Less polished and without the transparency of the Sechet, it nevertheless exhibits formidable density and finishes with a positively gripping sense of tactile minerality, citrus zest, and peach kernel. This should loosen up and become more expressive with time, and be worth following for 6-8 years. The high-toned, palate-staining, tea-like, mineral-infused 2005 represents the sole instance where I marginally preferred Dauvissat’s wine of that vintage to his 2006.

Smelling sweetly of ripe peach, lily perfume, and a hint of vanilla, this fills the palate with lush fruit but also savory, saline, shrimp- and lobster-reduction mineral character, finishing with lip-smacking generosity and (for its appellation) startling length. I can see no reason to defer gratification, but this should drink nicely for another couple of years. As wonderful as this is for “simple” appellation Chablis, the 2005 is in the same exalted quality league.

141,Domaine Dauvissat-Camus,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"If you want more focus and delineation, and less power without sacrificing the opulence and chewy, fleshy character of this vintage, check out the 1992 Chablis-Les Clos.  Although low in acidity, it is long and rich, with an explosive finish.  It displays a penetrating bouquet of minerals combined with citrus aromas, and apple/orange-like fruit.  Full-bodied, rich, and more structured than any of the other grand crus from Dauvissat, this is a full-throttle Chablis for drinking over the next 7-8 years.

There are no secrets in the cellars of Dauvissat - impeccable viticultural techniques, modest yields, barrel fermentation, with ten months aging in cask produce lusty, rich, spicy wines. Dauvissat's 1992s look to be as exciting as his 1989s and 1986s.

147,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"I tasted Dauvissat’s 2008 Chablis Les Clos assembled from tank very shortly before bottling, where it demonstrated a remarkably dense yet buoyant layering of citrus, quince, white peach, and formidably concentrated chalk, oyster shell, and iodine minerality. Citrus rind, quinine and fruit pit bitterness help extend a cleansing, gum-adhering, electrically charged, practically searing finish that foreshadows at least 15 years of glory, provided premature oxidation does not lay it low, something no one can predict, and which the track record at this address renders unlikely but unfortunately by no means unthinkable. About the prowess of this wine over the next half dozen years, though, as well as about that of Les Clos the site, I am left in no doubt by my present experience.

Vincent Dauvissat points out that at least at his estate, 1996 was at once more severe yet more alcoholic and more exotic in aroma than what he terms the “more classic” vintage of 2008. Both years featured long cool growing seasons and wind-driven concentration in the late innings, but the fruit in 2008 was cleaner, and entirely botrytis-free, Dauvissat maintains. He says his 2008s come closer in character to 2002. (Incidentally, at age six months, Dauvissat’s 2009s showed promising vivacity and mineral inflection for their vintage.)

148,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"Rene Dauvissat’s 2008 Chablis La Forest achieves a remarkably vibrant sense of interplay and complexity characteristic both for its vintage and for this cuvee at its best. Scents of iris, white truffle, crushed chalk, saline-alkaline ocean breeze, tart plum, white peach and grapefruit all have their counterparts in a palate performance of riveting interactivity and prodigious yet continually fascinating length. There is a firm feel, brightness, and in the end a tendency for its mineral aspects to slightly dominate this show that result in a sparer impression than the corresponding 2007, something of a reversal of these vintage’s normal roles. Once again, here is an exceptional Chablis premier cru that should be worth following for a dozen or more years.

A wealth of marine elements is in fact present already in the nose, together with grapefruit and tangerine that deliver luscious juiciness on the palate. The generous fruit perfectly complements the wine’s mineral dimensions, which combines levity and almost vibratory energy with density.

Mysteriously marine though almost severe in its concentration and piquancy, this will need at least a couple of years in bottle to properly prove itself and show a more generous side. It’s certainly formidable already now, and I would not be surprised to see it reveal close to a decade’s stamina.

153,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"Early comparison of Vincent Dauvissat’s 2007 Chablis Preuses with his Les Clos is bound to flatter the former, as here is the essence of that mysteriously scallop-like, sweet, saline savor and a ravishing alliance of richness and textural creaminess with delicacy and refreshment such as you won’t often, if ever, find in another vineyard. Fresh lime, distilled herbal essences, orange oil, iris-like perfume, and honey waft from the nose; through a supremely elegant and dynamic mid-palate; to a finish that soars. No doubt 12-15 years of delight await those lucky enough to score some of this. 

Incidentally, this clearly blessed vineyard parcel lies between one of the two owned by Fevre and La Moutonne. Vincent Dauvissat (whose father Renee’s name has been removed from that of the domaine, a fact I neglected to reflect in my Issue 179 coverage) harvested between September 11 and 21 a crop entirely in keeping with his estate’s awesome track record. But things were not looking good, he says, until the north wind arrived to banish incipient botrytis and permit felicitous, healthy concentration. Hail trimmed some of his crop of generic Chablis and Vaillons, but left the foliage unscathed, he reports, so that fruit maturation was not retarded. The premier crus came in at not much over 12% natural alcohol and were lightly chaptalized, more to extend their fermentations, insists Dauvissat, than to boost body.

Suggestions of white truffle and iris waft ethereally throughout, while subtle suggestions of toasted nuts, iodine, clam liquor, and fruit pit add underlying, persistent piquancy. And for all of this wine’s energized and rarified nature, as well as its overt mineral character, it also evinces a subtle and winsome hint of creaminess. This is about as nuanced and rivetingly multi-faceted as premier cru Chablis gets, and it even tasted this way right off the bottling line!

155,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"Like this year’s La Forest, Dauvissat’s 2007 Chablis Les Clos seems palpably stony and chalky, yet boasts considerable gloss. It also displays a mollusk broth like dimension, here allied to sense of weight and sheer extract that none of the premier crus in this collection can claim. Hints of lanolin and vanilla make one aware of the barrel presence, and a toasted nut element helps lend a sense of richness as well as piquancy to what is otherwise a decidedly mineral-dominated as well as formidably long finish. It’s hard to imagine this (by Dauvissat’s own admission) massively dense wine ever achieving the elegance or mystery of the La Forest – let’s see in a few years – but as an expression of Kimmeridgian essence, it’s quite an achievement, and one sure to merit a dozen or more years’ attention.

Hints of bitter-sweet licorice and black fruits as well as invigoratingly saline and citrus zest notes add further allure. A shimmering exchange of bright citrus and myriad herbal, floral, and crystalline mineral notes makes for a lingering finish which, along with this wine’s combination of flavor concentration and delicacy, puts me in mind a bit of a great Riesling.

Honey-glazed, gingered lime, tangerine, pineapple, and yellow plum are lusciously allied on the palate with a sense of crushed stone and chalk I imagine straining through my teeth. Predictably, this is more adamant in its mineral character, more compact, and more overtly extract rich than the corresponding Sechet. But what it lacks in interplay or levity vis a vis that wine, it at least in part makes up for in layered density and sheer grip.

158,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis,"Like his Petit Chablis, consisting entirely of Left Bank material, Vincent Dauvissat’s 2007 Chablis smells strikingly of mint, fennel, iris, yellow plum, and lemon zest. Surprisingly, it is brighter in acids than the Petit Chablis (thanks presumably to the latter’s later harvest); firmly textured yet by no means deficient in underlying richness; and offers a dynamic interaction of citrus, flowers, and saline, stony mineral nuances that remind me of great Riesling as well as of Chablis with far higher pedigree. Persistently herbal and floral notes mingle with blond tobacco, toasted almond, and savory mineral elements in a long finish. The longer this takes on air, the more interesting and succulently savory it becomes, and one can anticipate at least 4-5 years of such satisfaction.

160,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses,"From cask, Dauvissat’s 2006 Chablis Preuses smells of toasted grain, roasted nuts, pungent buckwheat, ripe peach, high-toned floral perfume suggesting gentian, and ocean breeze. An amazing depth of indescribable minerality – approximating meat stock and crustacean reduction, with suggestions of soy – saturates the palate, leading to a generous yet still mysteriously savory, mouth-watering finish that contrasts dramatically with the chalky, faintly bitter character of the La Forest. This should become an extraordinary example of terroir and minerality within the context of enveloping richness, and of richness without the least bit of heaviness, and should mature excitingly for the next 12-15 years. Not that I would feel any compunction about pulling a cork now. “Compulsion” would be a better word for what I would feel if I were sitting on bottles of this gem! Exotically ripe, honeyed, almost buttery in texture, yet with palate-nipping hints of botrytis, the 2005 Preuses finds room for some mysterious, savory mineral nuances as well, but is not in the exalted class of this 2006. 

Vincent Dauvissat’s 2006s were finished with both alcoholic fermentation and malolactic transformation by January. Overall – and particularly in the Grand Cru range – Dauvissat’s 2005s are marginally less exciting than his 2006s, and in certain instances, surprisingly, more opulent and exotically ripe. In both recent vintages, Dauvissat’s wines (even the generics) are pushing 14% alcohol, although in tasting the 2006s in particular, you’d never guess this.

161,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos,"From cask, the 2006 Chablis Les Clos represents another striking contrast within this year’s R.& V. Dauvissat collection. After the welcoming richness and savory expressions of Chablis character in the Preuses, this wine displays a cool restraint and stony minerality. A fascinating wealth of floral and herbal nuances on the nose similarly infuse a mouth-filling, satiny, yet firm palate, accompanied by grapefruit, orange, gooseberry, white peach, cyanic hints of fruit pit, and chalk, and leading to a finish of extraordinary, subtle persistence. This formidably dense Chablis should be permitted several years of bottle evolution, and should then drink well for more than a decade. The 2005 is creamy, honeyed, malted, and amazingly concentrated, with hints of exotic fruits and bitter cyanic notes – an extravagantly, colorfully impressive Les Clos, if not quite at the quality level of the 2006.

162,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis 1er Cru Séchet,"Given the impressive abundance of hard-to-name mineral characteristics exhibited even by the generic wines in this collection, it comes as little surprise that Dauvissat’s 2006 Chablis Sechet is a stunner. Haunting notes of bitter-sweet iris, orange blossom, sea breeze, and lobster shell reduction rise from the glass. In the mouth, this combines seductive richness with lift and transparency to mineral and floral nuance, and the finish weaves a complex lace of ineffable (saline, chalky, ore-like?) mineral matter over a luscious grounding of ripe peach, honeydew melon, and citrus. It should delight over the next 5-7 years.  The floral, saline 2005 is well-concentrated and admirably clear, if marginally less impressive than this 2006.

163,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis 1er Cru La Forest,"The Dauvissats’ 2006 Chablis La Forest (a.k.a. “La Foret” a.k.a. “La Forets”) smells effusively of peony, citrus, and peach. It is strikingly bitter-sweet in its alternation of peach and citrus with peach kernel-like cyanic bitterness; displays deep chalkiness; and finishes with amazing grip and length. Past the nose, this is one of the least generous of 2006 Chablis, being remarkably tight and for a young 2006, but very impressively concentrated. The 2005 rendition was almost severe in its concentration, yet also very impressive. It should merit following for 10-12 years, and is probably best rested for a year or two. The 1999 tastes glorious, and youthful today; the still almost sharply-citric 1996, like liquid chalk and white truffle.

164,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis 1er Cru Vaillons,"The Dauvissat 2006 Chablis Vaillons leads with citrus and spice, gooseberry and peach kernel, backed by chalky and iodine-like expressions of minerality. Less polished and without the transparency of the Sechet, it nevertheless exhibits formidable density and finishes with a positively gripping sense of tactile minerality, citrus zest, and peach kernel. This should loosen up and become more expressive with time, and be worth following for 6-8 years. The high-toned, palate-staining, tea-like, mineral-infused 2005 represents the sole instance where I marginally preferred Dauvissat’s wine of that vintage to his 2006.

165,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Chablis,"Another generique exceptional for being hand-harvested and for its quality is the Dauvissat 2006 Chablis. Smelling sweetly of ripe peach, lily perfume, and a hint of vanilla, this fills the palate with lush fruit but also savory, saline, shrimp- and lobster-reduction mineral character, finishing with lip-smacking generosity and (for its appellation) startling length. I can see no reason to defer gratification, but this should drink nicely for another couple of years. As wonderful as this is for “simple” appellation Chablis, the 2005 is in the same exalted quality league.

The Dauvissats have two hectares of Petit Chablis, situated near La Forest, and there are few better examples. Enjoy it by the end of 2010.

The palate is medium-bodied with supple and very fine, almost filigree tannins. The acidity is beautifully judged here -- very focused and refined, seamless towards the sophisticated finish.

The palate speaks more of the growing season than the terroir, although it is pleasant and easy-drinking thanks to the ripe, almost saccharine red cherries and strawberry fruit. There is plenty of sucrose character here, although it pales against recent successes from this vineyard. Tasted June 2015.",2003 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,RP 89?
198,Domaine Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"The La Grande Rue Grand Cru 2006 has a pastille-like purity on the nose, touches of black olive and iodine coming through with aeration. It does not quite possess the complexity of recent vintages, but it offers some chutzpah. The palate is medium-bodied and nicely focused, very sappy in the mouth but showing some toughness on the kirsch-tinged finish. Maybe another year or two in bottle will help this grand cru to coalesce. Maybe not?",2006 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 89?
199,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 1952 Grands Echézeaux from Lamarche is an ""old dame"" of a wine. The bouquet is still vital with scents of decayed red berry fruit, singed leather, damp forest floor and Provençal herbs, all with quite exquisite delineation. The palate is not quite as convincing as the aromatics–yet they do not disappoint one iota. It is extremely well balanced with a nigh on perfect seam of acidity binding its delicate constituent parts together. Autumn leaves abound, rustic ferrous red fruit disappearing over the horizon like the rear light of the last train home vanishing in the distance. Elegiac for sure, but it still does not stint on doling out pleasure.  ",1952 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
200,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2013 Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru has a strict and linear nose at first, a little aloof perhaps, but very well defined and focused with perfumed red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly grainy tannin, very good depth and yet it ""floats"" across the mouth, finally delivering the structure just on the masculine, austere finish. Again, it is very well proportioned and natural with a dash of spice lingering on the aftertaste. Utterly entrancing.",2013 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
201,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts came across as more surly and backward on the nose when I tasted it at the domaine. The fruit is darker than the La Croix Rameau with blackberry leaf, cranberry, woodland and tree bark aromas: complex but distant. The palate is therefore surprisingly succulent and fleshy on the entry. There is a lovely saline tang at the front of the mouth, commendable weight and real persistence and structure on the finish. Again, this is very elegant and intense, the aftertaste bewilderingly long! ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,RP 89?
202,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru La Croix Rameau, nestling just between Romanée-Saint-Vivant and the village (a propitious location) has a gutsy, energetic, vibrant bouquet that offers an equal measure of black and red fruit: blackberry, cranberry leaf, wet soil, and a light musky scent. This is complex and engaging. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, extremely well-judged acidity, edgy and tense, like a person waiting to say something vitally important. Not quite as long as Les Suchots, but beautifully poised, this comes highly recommended. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,RP 89?
203,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru les Cras has a perfumed, floral bouquet that is very well defined, offering crisp black cherries, maraschino and citrus fruit. The palate is very well structured with fine tannin, perfectly judged acidity, a tangible backbone lending structure and weight towards the finish. Perfectly proportioned, I can see this ageing nicely over the next couple of decades. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 89?
204,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée Village,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée Village comes from Lamarche's usual five parcels of vine. It has lucid ruby color. The nose is natural and refined: raspberry, strawberry and freshly tilled soil. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, slightly brittle tannins accompanied by good depth of slightly darker fruit than the Bourgogne Rouge: cranberry here, flanked by raspberry and blackberry. This is nicely structured with a harmonious finish that lingers in the mouth to complete an accomplished Vosne-Romanée Villages. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée Village,RP 89?
205,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits,"Picked around October 12-13, when the maturity had stopped accumulating, the 2013 Hautes Cotes de Nuits has a broad and generous bouquet with raspberry preserve and light woodland scents, all ""transparent"" and harmonious. The palate is medium-bodied with chalky tannins, very well-judged acidity and very pure. This is one of the best wines from the Hautes Cotes that I have encountered. ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits,RP 89?
206,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Bourgogne Pinot Noir,"The 2013 Bourgogne Rouge has an endearing nose that is a little charmer right from the start, offering ""perky"" red cherries and bergamot scents. The palate is underpinned by crisp acidity, bright and sharp in the mouth, leaving the palate refreshed immediately upon exit. Very fine ",2013 Domaine Lamarche Bourgogne Pinot Noir,RP 89?
207,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Grands Echézeaux 2011  from Lamarche clearly has more fruit concentration than the offering from Albert Bichot: raspberry and wild strawberry racing out of the blocks, subtle wilted rose petal scents and minerality. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, plenty of tart cherries and strawberry notes that gently build in the mouth. There is a gentle grip here and some unresolved oak to be subsumed, but there is great substance and length – the standout wine from Lamarche this year. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
208,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts 2011 has a deep, quite broody but well-defined bouquet with blackberry, raspberry and sous-bois scents. Perhaps there is a little stem addition here, but if so it is discretely covered. The palate is medium-bodied with supple ripe red cherry and raspberry fruit. This is controlled and nicely focused with a tangy, quite spicy finish that maintains precision. Give this aristocratic and graceful Malconsorts two or three years in the cellar at least – it’s a wine of breeding and class. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Malconsorts,RP 89?
209,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Croix Rameau 2011 is one of the best from Lamarche in this vintage. It has a bright and perky bouquet with cranberry and Morello cherry scents: very Vosne-like with fine definition, although lighter than its peers. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp tannins, fine tension and engaging tart cherry/citrus notes toward the finish. This is a lively, tensile Vosne-Romanée that punches above its weight. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,RP 89?
210,Domaine Francois Lamarche,La Grande Rue Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The La Grande Rue Grand Cru has one of the most precocious bouquets of the 2011 grand cru tasted blind. It offers a surfeit of kirsch, redcurrant jam, raspberry preserve and candied orange peel all struck through with tangible minerality and tension. The palate is sweet and pure with ebullient red brambly fruit under a veneer of new wood, but the two are effortlessly in sync. It gently builds toward an ostentatious and almost ravishing finish only confined by the limitations of the growing season. This is a hedonistic and luxuriant delight - all while upholding the essence of the vineyard. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche La Grande Rue Grand Cru,RP 89?
211,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Clear ruby in color, the Vosne-Romanée Les Chaumes from Lamarche has a delightful, delineated bouquet with cranberry and wild strawberry scents, quite forward and confident. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy ripe tannins, plenty of succulent red cherry and strawberry fruit with nicely judged acidity. Good weight in the mouth, perhaps a little fat with an easy-drinking, pleasurable finish that exerts a gentle but insistent grip.",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes,RP 89?
212,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Echézeaux Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Echézeaux Grand Cru 2011 from Lamarche is showing a lot of reduction on the nose that makes it difficult for the fruit to express itself. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy, grippy tannins. This comes across as more masculine than its peers, nevertheless I appreciate the detail and focus on the linear finish. Returning after 10 minutes there is a more obvious chocolate note emerging on the finish that erases a little detail, but it is still a satisfactory grand cru, if not one that demands a truckload of superlatives.",2011 Domaine Lamarche Echézeaux Grand Cru,RP 89?
213,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Suchots 2011 is more reserved on the nose than their Chaumées, but there is a touch more complexity, the brambly red and black fruit infused with fine minerality and tension. The palate is smooth and rounded on the entry with a lot of extraction so that it feels plump around the middle. Juicy and pure, what it lacks in complexity is compensated by its saturated tannins and opulent blueberry-tinged finish that is just missing some persistence, cutting away before you have had an opportunity to show your gratitude. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Suchots,RP 89?
214,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Cras 2011 from Lamarche has quite a ravishing, opulent and feisty bouquet that races out of the blocks with copious small dark cherries, cassis and spicy fruit. The aromatics are perhaps too ostentatious for my preference. The palate is very ripe, showy and juicy, although it does not possess the finesse or sophistication of the same cru from Louis-Michel Liger-Belair. One has the impression of trying too hard to be a Vosne-Romanée, and not quite pulling it off, perhaps due to a slight oxidation. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,RP 89?
215,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Clos Vougeot,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. Lucid ruby color, the Clos Vougeot ‘11 has a rather two-dimensional bouquet, quite earthy and needing more fruit -- a “flightless” bouquet. The palate is rather austere and masculine and I would have preferred more flesh towards the finish. I was initially quite severe with this wine, although it does improve in the glass, gaining some cohesion and vigor. Having said that, I still feel that this is not one of the domaine’s strongest efforts this year. ",2011 Domaine Lamarche Clos Vougeot,RP 89?
216,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Grands Echézeaux Grand Cru,"The 2012 Grands Echezeaux Grand Cru comes from the family’s 0.30-hectare parcel split over three plots. It has a more mineral-driven bouquet than fruit-driven at the moment, with touches of cold limestone infusing the tart red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, open red berry fruit, good backbone and a somehow conservative and yet appealing finish. This is a Grands Echezeaux unapologetically classic in style, the terroir really showing through at this early stage, although I would like more matiere on the finish. Very fine. 

Domaine Francois Lamarche is renowned for its monopole La Grande Rue that lies on the opposite side of the road from Romanee-Conti, although its history is far less illustrious, at least until recent times when it has been great to see this domaine’s wines radically improving. La Grande Rue was apparently a wedding gift to Henri Lamarche given in 1933 (better than a toaster) although the monopole was not even a grand cru until a rare promotion in 1992, albeit at a time when it was recognized that yields were way too high. Nicole Lamarche has been the winemaker here since 2007, whilst her sister Nathalie is in charge of marketing along with her aunt. The harvest commenced on 22 September and lasted for five or six days and all cuvees include around 30% whole cluster fruit and underwent long malo-lactic fermentation. The samples were taken directly from stainless steel tank and will be bottled in approximately three months’ time. The wines of this domaine have a distinct style. They have always been lighter than their peers, prioritizing finer tannins and more red fruit than black. Just taste through say, Bernard Gros’ and Lamarche’s wines one after the other and you see for yourself two dichotomous expressions of the same patch of earth. I have a penchant for Lamarche’s style of Pinot Noir and appreciated and praised recent vintages, although apropos these 2012s, I have to admit that I was seeking just a little more substance, a touch more conviction percolating through. I enjoyed them, but mentally I found myself wanting to “gee them up”, muster more vigor and flair.

217,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Malconsorts,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Malconsorts comes from a demi-hectare of vines split over two plots. It has a subtle, understated bouquet that initially seems lighter than several of its peers, but it is very nuanced with subtle tertiary, almost granitic scents infusing the patina of brambly red berries. With a few more swirls, there are lovely wild heather notes emerging. The palate is medium-bodied but more supple and fuller than the Les Suchots  - in fact, this has a Les Suchots like exuberance that is tailored towards the finish to suit a more upstanding, regal Malconsorts. There is a lovely black pepper note that lingers on the finish here. Very fine.

218,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru La Croix Rameau,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru La Croix Rameau comes from a tiny 0.21-hectare parcel of vines tucked into a plot between Romanee-Saint Vivant and the outbuildings of the village (there are just three exploitants.) It has a rounded, pastille-like purity on the nose: strawberry and just a hint of mulberry at the moment, developing nicely in the glass though. The palate is harmonious on the entry with light tannins, clean fresh and quite linear red cherry and raspberry fruit that segues into an edgy, citric finish that is very appealing. This is a lovely, unpretentious premier cru.

219,Domaine Francois Lamarche,Nuits Saint-Georges 1er Cru Aux Cras,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Les Cras comes from 0.37-hectares of vine under metayage. The nose is very fragrant with hints of dried flowers and incense infusing the dark berry fruit that unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a sweet, candied entry. The acidity is nicely judged and there is good structure on the slightly foursquare finish. Give this a year in bottle and you should have an attractive NSG that will last a decade or more.

The palate is medium-bodied with a light, crisp entry. There is a real citric thread here but the finish needs to must more flesh on the finish.

260,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Muscat,"There are a couple of new experimental wines in the Collection line, starting with the 2014 Collection Muscat, which sources its grapes from Itata. The grapes were hand-harvested, destemmed and fermented in contact with the skins with indigenous yeasts. That lent it a golden color and a deep nose redolent of Muscat pulp, something musky, and also orange blossom and orange peel. The wine was kept in used oak barrels for one year (no aromas) and apparently 20% of the time, the wine developed a veil of yeasts, which in the nose is not perceptible, such are the strong aromas of the variety. As is usually the case, you expect a sweet wine and then it's bone dry, somehow austere, sharp and makes you salivate. It has the flavors of fresh Moscatel grapes. Very interesting. Only 603 bottles were filled. ",2014 Lapostolle Collection Muscat,RP 89
261,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cuvee Alexandre Sauvignon Blanc,"There is a new white in the Cuvée Alexandre range, a Sauvignon sourced from their estate Las Kuras in the Cachapoal Valley, which is aptly named 2014 Cuvée Alexandre Sauvignon Blanc. There is notable absence of herbal aromas and the fruit is riper, but in the citric style with some white flowers and white fruit. The palate is soft, it does not have the vibrant and sharp profile of the coastal Sauvignons; here there is a different balance and lower acidity. Pleasant, easy to drink. 15,000 bottles.",2014 Lapostolle Cuvee Alexandre Sauvignon Blanc,RP 89
262,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Vigno,"Believe it or not, Lapostolle has also surrendered to the Carignan craze, and there is a 2013 Vigno from them. I tasted this next to all of the other Vigno and later tasted the 2014 version with the rest of The Collection. The grapes are sourced from Truquilemu in the Empedrado zone from a coastal part of Maule. It has the same bottle as the Collection range, and the low quantities produced are also in line with it. The bunches are hand-destemmed and the grapes fermented in small pools with indigenous yeasts. The wine matured in used 300-liter French oak barrels for ten months after malolactic. It contains 3% Garnacha. It has a bright and vivacious color denoting high acidity. The nose is explosive, terribly floral, open, powerful and with bright cherry fruit, all red and blue, no traces of black fruit. The palate has incredible freshness, electric acidity (it has an extremely low pH f 3.3) and great freshness; it is quite vertical with moderate alcohol at 13.5% and superb balance. This is plain gorgeous. Bravo! Unfortunately only 326 bottles were produced in 2013, its third vintage, so very few people will be able to taste this wine. I wish they produced a little more...",2013 Lapostolle Vigno,RP 89
263,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Alcohuaz Syrah,"There are no less than six Syrahs from 2013 in The Collection, and there might even be more as some others are produced depending on the vintage. This time I tasted all of them side by side, from north to south; so the first one was the 2013 Collection Alcohuaz Syrah form Elqui, in fact form grapes purchased from the new project from the Flaño family. It is a high altitude vineyard that belongs to the Andes appellation, as it's really high up in the mountains at some 1,800 meters altitude. Because of the altitude, the growing cycle is very short and the grapes are harvested in February. The nose is fresh, mixing spices and herbs with some smoked bacon and black olives, unmistakably Syrah from cool climate in a cool vintage. The palate is even more expressive, compact and intense with marked flavors and great freshness. There are some fine-grained tannins that would welcome food. 344 bottles produced.",2013 Lapostolle Collection Alcohuaz Syrah,RP 89
264,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Pirque Syrah,"The Pirque Valley within Maipo, a higher altitude part in the Andes appellation, is the source of the 2013 Collection Pirque Syrah. This is a Syrah of marked personality from one of the oldest Syrah vineyards in the region, in a particularly cooler terroir within Pirque; this keeps the acidity and shows the Maipo character with some minty and balsamic aromas, as well as a mixture of red and black berries. The palate shows a powerful wine with volume and tension. Clearly Maipo and Syrah, faithful to what the label says. Only 357 bottles were bottled unfined and unfiltered in March 2014. ",2013 Lapostolle Collection Pirque Syrah,RP 89
265,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Las Kuras Syrah,"There is a strong note of licorice in the 2013 Collection Las Kuras Syrah from the Cachapoal Andes appellation. There is also some aniseed, an aroma that is often linked to licorice. This comes from a vineyard at some 450-500 meters altitude that was grafted over Chardonnay. The soil is very stony and deep on an old river bed. The palate reveals a powerful wine, expressive and intense. 337 bottles.",2013 Lapostolle Collection Las Kuras Syrah,RP 89
266,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Portezuelo Carmenere,"There are three Carménères from The Collection, all three from the Colchagua Valley, but each showing one of the three appellations from mountain to sea: Colchagua Andes, Colchagua Entre Cordilleras (between mountain ranges) and Colchagua Costa. The coastal wine is the 2013 Collection Portezuelo Carménères, produced with grapes sourced from Los Lingues, but unfortunately the brand is registered by someone and cannot be used (which is ridiculous) -- but anyway, these grapes are purchased from Koyle, an organically and biodynamically farmed vineyard at some 500 meters altitude. The nose has a very strong spicy aroma, pink pepper (what in Argentina call aguaribay), paprika and even the smoky mix used in Chile called Merkén. This is not as chocolatey and wide as the Carménères form flatter zones; this is a granite slope and within the natural structure of Carmenere, this is a little lighter. 2013 was a cooler year and there are some herbaceous notes. Carménère might not be a grape for everyone; the different styles are quite marked, and this one is lighter and a little greener. So it's a matter of taste. 663 bottles produced",2013 Lapostolle Collection Portezuelo Carmenere,RP 89
267,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection San Jose Apalta Syrah,"The 2013 Collection San José Apalta Syrah is sourced from Lapostolle's vineyard that used to produce the Cuvée Alexandre Syrah, cofermented with a little Viognier, quite classical from the Entre Cordilleras; it is ripe with notes of dark chocolate and black fruit. This is a warm terroir in a cool vintage and the wine comes through as powerful while keeping good freshness. The fruit is a little sweeter than the other Syrahs, as it should be in the warmer central part, the Entre Cordilleras appellation of Colchagua Valley. As with all the Collection bottlings, this is extremely limited; only 342 bottles were filled in March 2014. ",2013 Lapostolle Collection San Jose Apalta Syrah,RP 89
268,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection El Rosario Syrah,"The 2013 Collection El Rosario Syrah comes from the same field as the Westerly Syrah form Casablanca, but the field is so large that it falls in two separate appellations; this one is San Antonio, also from the Costa, as both Casablanca and San Antonio are 'Costa.' The three appellations (Costa, Entre Cordilleras and Andes) are delimited by temperature, especially in the case of Costa. In fact, the wine shows some similarities, ripe fruit and a Mediterranean character, with plenty of meaty aromas and a hint of smoky bacon, very Syrah. The palate is pungent with grainy tannins and good freshness within the ripe profile of the wine. 348 bottles.",2013 Lapostolle Collection El Rosario Syrah,RP 89
269,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Pumanque Carmenere,"The wilder 2013 Collection Pumanque Carménère is from an east-facing slope on granite-rich soils in quartz, in the Coastal part of Colchagua, which has more marine influence though still some 30 kilometers from the ocean. The nose is really wild with herbal aromas, even iodine and tomato leaf that can be a bit too much. The palate from this zone that gives a very different nose is somehow similar to the one from Apalta, medium to full-bodied with grainy, slightly dusty tannins and, like all of the wines in the Collection, with good acidity. It feels quite polished; I was expecting a wilder palate, perhaps one year in bottle has polished its edges. Pumanque is in fact an appellation, and is the name of a village. Only 564 bottles were filled in June 2014.",2013 Lapostolle Collection Pumanque Carmenere,RP 89
270,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cabernet Sauvignon Cuvee Alexandre,"Somehow I found similar herbal aromas to the Carménère in the 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon; I guess it might have been the 2013 cold growing season. There is a roasted coffee and charred wood character in the nose intermixed with aromas of blackberries, cassis and mint. The palate is medium-bodied with abundant, fine-grained tannins and a slight bitterness in the finish. 252,240 bottles produced.",2013 Lapostolle Cabernet Sauvignon Cuvee Alexandre,RP 89
271,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Westerly Syrah,"I found the nose of the 2013 Collection Westerly Syrah form Casablanca quite ripe. These grapes were harvested late, as it comes from the Casablanca Costa where the challenge is to achieve ripeness. It shows some aromas of Mediterranean herbs, hay and straw, even esparto grass, in a profile that made me think of a Mediterranean Syrah; it has a little cooked fruit that turned into perhaps a meat stew with some paprika, and is quite open and expressive. The palate has pungent flavors and grainy, slightly dusty tannins. 341 bottles.
",2013 Lapostolle Collection Westerly Syrah,RP 89
272,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Apalta Carmenere,"The 2013 Collection Apalta Carménère is sourced from the central part of Colchagua, from the appellation now called Colchagua Entre Cordilleras -- in fact, from their Apalta vineyard. Here there are more classical aromas often associated with Carménère, such as graphite and ripe black fruit, which in a cool vintage like 2013 are not exaggerated, and the notes of dark chocolate and coffee are a lot lighter. This is clearly not as ripe and wide as others, and has the Apalta granite texture that provides a sensation of freshness and a finish full of aromatic herbs. 640 bottles were filled in June 2014.",2013 Lapostolle Collection Apalta Carmenere,RP 89
273,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cuvee Alexandre Carmenere,"The 2011 Cuvee Alexandre Carménère has strong herbal aromas (Jalapeño peppers?), plenty of notes of dark chocolate and some sensations that made me think of charred grape skins.

274,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Clos Apalta,"The 2012 Clos Apalta started off a little closed, but with air, the spicy aromas seemed to dominate (cloves, black pepper); there are also lots of smoky notes over a core of ripe black fruit with a volatile hint. It feels young and greatly marked by its two years in new French oak barrels. The palate is still young and tannic, and the finish is a little dry. There's not a lot of fruit in there and it somehow feels like it lacks a bit in the mid palate. For fans of the style, but even though, you should wait to pull the cork. 61,000 bottles produced.",2012 Lapostolle Clos Apalta,RP 89
275,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Chardonnay Cuvee Alexandre,"The 2012 Cuvee Alexandre Chardonnay is produced with Casablanca fruit in a warm vintage, part fermented in inox and part in oak to keep the freshness and balance. It smells of lemon meringue with a smoky note, aromas of citric fruit and yellow plums with sweet vanilla. The palate shows the oak a lot more, and there is creaminess in the texture, some drying tannins and a slightly bitter finish that detracts from its drinkability, but it should do well with soft paste cheeses or white meats. Drink now-2016.  

I visited the impressive Lapostolle winery and vineyards on a warm day in Colchagua where I met the charming Alexandra Marnier Lapostolle, who everybody calls simply “Madam.” The impressive six-level winery, built in an elliptic shape, is pure state of the art. The vineyards are planted at 6,660 vines per plant, which is the density of the old plantings from the 1920s. They started in 1995 and planted the same density in 1996. They took off with biodynamics in 2004, and converted 100% in 2006. Since 2011, they have been fully Demeter certified. Michel Rolland is the consultant here, mainly for the blends, not much for viticulture. The winery for Clos Apalta didn’t suffer any damage from the 2010 earthquake, but the other winery had big losses, so the modern construction showed extremely solid. I tasted extensively there, especially the top-of-the-range Clos Apalta, and while the 2011 showed fresher and more balanced than previous vintages, I often found over-aggressive wines with plenty of tannins that feel foursquare with years in bottle and don’t seem to develop much complexity or finesse. It’s as if the yields were perhaps too low or the wines had been too extracted. Accidentally, I had a Mourvedre and a Petit Verdot during a dinner that were a revelation, and I found the wines to be much fresher and better balanced. I asked for samples of these wines to taste, because I thought they were interesting and different. They are part of a small line of specialty wines they call Lapostolle Collection where, to be honest, I found the most exciting and drinkable wines from Lapostolle. Total production is around 200,000 cases of 12 bottles.

It has a fruit-driven nose with ripe notes of plums, a spirity touch, aromas of cereal and blackberries. The palate is medium-bodied with dusty tannins and a bit drying toward the end. It needs food.

The vineyards are planted at 6,660 vines per plant, which is the density of the old plantings from the 1920s. They started in 1995 and planted the same density in 1996. They took off with biodynamics in 2004, and converted 100% in 2006. Since 2011, they have been fully Demeter certified. Michel Rolland is the consultant here, mainly for the blends, not much for viticulture. The winery for Clos Apalta didn’t suffer any damage from the 2010 earthquake, but the other winery had big losses, so the modern construction showed extremely solid. I tasted extensively there, especially the top-of-the-range Clos Apalta, and while the 2011 showed fresher and more balanced than previous vintages, I often found over-aggressive wines with plenty of tannins that feel foursquare with years in bottle and don’t seem to develop much complexity or finesse. It’s as if the yields were perhaps too low or the wines had been too extracted. Accidentally, I had a Mourvedre and a Petit Verdot during a dinner that were a revelation, and I found the wines to be much fresher and better balanced. I asked for samples of these wines to taste, because I thought they were interesting and different. They are part of a small line of specialty wines they call Lapostolle Collection where, to be honest, I found the most exciting and drinkable wines from Lapostolle. Total production is around 200,000 cases of 12 bottles.

277,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Clos Apalta,"The 2011 Clos Apalta is a blend from a cold vintage aged in 100% new barrels for about two years, depending on how they find the wine, and the wine that makes it into the bottle is a barrel selection. 2011 was a cool vintage, perhaps something between 2010 and 2013, warmer than the former, more moderate than the latter; it’s the freshest of all the vintages that I tried, with good acidity, finer tannins, density, freshness and finesse as well as very good balance and a silky texture. As for future vintages, the 2012 will be bottled earlier, as it was a warm vintage and needs less maturing in oak. The 2013, which is still very young and was pre-blended the day before my tasting with Michel Rolland, will be bottled a year from now and will be re-evaluated before being bottled, when the blend might be adjusted at the last minute. I also tasted an impressive new wine from very old vines that were traditionally blended into the Clos with a long aging in the T5 barrels from Taransaud. Drink 2016-2026.

278,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Mourvedre,"I really enjoyed the Collection wines, small lots sourced from different valleys, fermented with indigenous yeasts, true to their variety and origin, with very respectful oak that is transparent to the wines. My favorite was the 2011 Collection Mourvedre from Apalta, a variety that seems to fit perfectly with the terroir and warm climate of this magical valley combining rustic and elegant notes of tree bark and violets, juicy and fresh, with very good acidity, supple and tasty, with fine tannins, very long and with pungent flavors that stay in your mouth, no doubt helped by the 14.5% alcohol which feels completely integrated, adding Mediterranean warmth to this superb Mourvedre. Well worth every penny. Bravo! Drink 2014-2019.

279,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection El Silo Syrah,"Some might find the nose of the 2011 Collection El Silo Syrah overpowering, as it seems to literally jump out of the glass and grab you by the neck, pulling you into the wilderness of the Elqui valley in the north of Chile, where these grapes are grown. Tremendously balsamic, with aromas of roasted meat, tar, black pepper and other spices, black and even green olives, with a juicy currant core, it seems to smell almost salty. The palate is savory, with very spicy, intense smoke flavors of tar and peat, pungent flavors that would do well with barbecued meat. A Syrah of strong personality, a bit extreme perhaps, showing the wilder side of the variety and the intensity of the place. It makes me want to go to Elqui. Drink 2014-2018.  I should do my best to taste the entire Collection next time. I like its personality, balance, power and elegance, true vins de terroir.

280,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Collection Petit Verdot,"It seems like the Petit Verdot behaves much better in Apalta than in its native land, as you can see in the 2011 Collection Petit Verdot, a varietal Petit Verdot from fruit grown in the Apalta Valley within Colchagua. The nose is showy, almost exotic, combining notes of spices and flowers. It possesses the brightness of the New World while keeping its French accent, and is ripe with black fruit aromas and some smoky tones. The oak, as in all the wines I sampled from the Collection series, is imperceptible and the wine is at the forefront, representing the variety and location well. This is a stunning Petit Verdot, unlike few in the southern hemisphere, a variety often found in blends, but not that often able to stand alone. Well done! Drink 2014-2019.

This is from Pumanque, from granite soils and has strong herbal aromas intermixed with notes of flowers, pepper and a soapy touch. It is very Carmenere, ripe but not overripe, a good combination of Atlantic and Mediterranean characteristics, with polished tannins and good-enough acidity. A Carmenere of marked personality.

The year that was definitively marked by a strong earthquake in Chile (February 27, just before the harvest). The wine is the result of the selection of the best lots after fermenting 200,000 kilograms of hand-destemmed grapes in the state of the art winery, where everything is moved by gravity. The base is always two thirds Carmenere complemented by Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, whose proportions might vary with each vintage. It has some leather aromas along with notes of licorice, tempera paint and Chinese ink, scents of black and red fruit underneath a thick layer of spices and smoke aromas. The palate is full-bodied, with good freshness and a patina of grainy, chalky tannins that give it a little drying sensation. One for the long run, let’s hope the animal character does not develop too much in bottle. Drink 2016-2025.

Its raspberry liqueur, cherry, and blackberry aromas are followed by an immensely concentrated, well-balanced, and powerful character.

Casa Lapostolle, where Bordeaux's famed oenologist Michel Rolland spends a couple of weeks a year, is one of the few islands of high quality in a sea of wine dominated by dilution, vapidness, and commercial blandness/mediocrity.

331,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced under the watchful eye of Michel Rolland, this estate's brilliant consulting winemaker, the grapefruit-scented 1999 Sauvignon Blanc is rich, fresh, plump, and possesses a medium-bodied personality. This gooseberry and citrus fruit-flavored wine has excellent balance, what appears to be relatively high levels of CO2 (just enough to render it lively and fresh), as well as a long, flavorful finish. Drink it over the next year.

332,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Clos Apalta,"One thousand, eight hundred cases of this extraordinary wine were produced from the oldest (50 years average age) non-irrigated vines controlled by Casa Lapostolle.  The blend of 95% Merlot and 5% Carmenere, aged in 100% new French oak casks, and bottled with neither fining nor filtration, is a triumph in wine making.  Yields were kept to a conservative 40 hectoliters per hectare, resulting in an opaque purple-colored wine with an exquisite nose of black cherry, blackberry, and creme de cassis fruit intertwined with subtle toasty oak and lead pencil.  Full-bodied, with an opulent texture, sensational concentration, and layered nuances, this wine will have 10-15 years of longevity, although its fatness and low acidity give it immediate accessibility.  This superb wine is a tour de force.  Not surprisingly, the consulting winemaker was Pomerol's brilliant Michel Rolland.  Anticipated maturity: now-2015.  This wine is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 1.  This wine may appear expensive vis a vis the run of the mill juice coming out of Chile, but in today's marketplace, this effort are sensibly priced.  Serious wine tasters should give it a try.

",1997 Lapostolle Clos Apalta,RP 90
333,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Chardonnay Cuvee Alexandre,"Remarkably, Casa Lapostelle is now producing approximately 12,000 cases of this barrel-fermented wine.  The wine, which spends 7 months on it lees, with plenty of stirring, leans more toward a California-like, tropical fruit-scented Chardonnay than the more mineral-flavored, austere style of white Burgundy.   This is a superb wine.  The oak is integrated, and the wine reveals a  leesy, roasted hazel nut complexity to go along with copious quantities of tropical fruit, good glycerin, and a medium to full-bodied personality. It should drink well for 1-2 years.

334,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Sauvignon Blanc,"There are 30,000 cases of this wine, which is a terrific Sauvignon, with gobs of melony, floral, and honeyed fruit, medium body, a plush texture, and outstanding purity. It should be drunk over the next 6-8 months, while waiting for the 1998 to be released.    Importer: Schieffelin & Somerset Co., New York, NY; tel.

335,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Merlot Cuvee Alexandre,"Oenologist Michel Rolland's origin and home is the world's finest Merlot region, Pomerol, and he exhibits the magic touch when it comes to this varietal. Approximately 11,000 cases were produced of this wine.  At full retail, it sells for a price slightly beyond the range for this article, but those buying it by the case should be able to pick it up for around $15-$16. I cannot think of another Merlot produced anywhere in the world that consistently comes close to this quality ... at this price. This wine boasts a dense, opaque purple color, as well as knock-out aromatics of chocolate, and sweet black berry and cherry fruit, followed by explosive richness on the palate, low acidity, a sumptuous, lush mouthfeel, nicely integrated oak, and a layered, glycerin-enhanced finish. Drink this wine over the next 5-8 years.

336,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cabernet Sauvignon Cuvee Alexandre,"This wine, made from 50 year old vines (7,000 cases produced), is close to being outstanding. Made from a dry-farmed vineyard, the nose displays Bordeaux-like pain grille notes, along with cassis, fruitcake, tobacco, and cedar. In the mouth, it is rich, low in acidity, with excellent purity, medium to full body, and a surprisingly long finish. This impressively-endowed Cabernet Sauvignon can be drunk now or cellared for 7-10 years.

338,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a good wine, and certainly competes well with other similarly-priced Cabernets, but it is not very exciting. This wine (a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot) displays medium body, cassis fruit, good purity, some tannin, and a clipped, compact finish. Drink it over the next 2-3 years.

339,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Merlot Cuvee Alexandre,"The 1995 Merlot Cuvee Alexandre offers beautifully integrated, toasty, smoky oak, combined with plenty of lush, ripe, jammy black-cherry fruit intermixed with scents of coffee and chocolate. Ripe and opulent, with a sweet, creamy mid-section and excellent purity, this is a nearly outstanding example of Merlot that can be purchased for a reasonable price. It should drink well for 3-4 years. France's leading consultant/oenologist, Michel Rolland, has had a significant influence on the quality of this Chilean estate's wines.

340,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Chardonnay Cuvee Alexandre,"Even richer and more complex than the regular cuvee, the 1995 Chardonnay Cuvee Alexandre is similar to a rich, smoky, buttery, nutty-scented and flavored Meursault. It reveals more honeyed, smoky richness, a sweeter (from ripeness and extract, not sugar), lush, opulent texture, and concentrated, full-bodied flavors. This wine spent five months in new oak casks, received full malolactic, and was bottled with only a light filtration. It is a delicious, serious Chardonnay for drinking over the next 18 months.

341,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Sauvignon Blanc,"The 1995 Sauvignon Blanc must be one of the world's best buys in Sauvignon. Although it will require drinking before the end of 1996, it still merits purchasing by the case for its exceptionally high quality and budget price. It offers up a knock-out nose of honeyed melons, figs, and citrus. Creamy-textured, with amazing flavor intensity for a wine of this price, this medium to full-bodied, lusty Sauvignon is a dead-ringer for a good white Graves. The low acidity and voluptuous richness combine to make this the most striking Sauvignon I have ever consumed for under $10 a bottle. Don't dare miss it!

This supple wine exhibits more depth than the regular cuvee, as well as weedy, cassis-like aromas and flavors.

346,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Merlot Cuvee Alexandre,"Michel Rolland (who must feel comfortable with Merlot given the fact that his home is in Pomerol) has helped fashion one of the finest South American Merlots I have ever tasted. Casa Lapostolle's 1994 Merlot Cuvee Alexandre exhibits a dense, dark ruby/purple color, followed by a big nose of spicy new oak, and jammy red and black fruits. Dense, rich, and concentrated, with medium to full body, and an undeniable degree of elegance to go along with the fat and intensity, this velvety-textured, thick Merlot is comparable to wines selling for $20-$35 a bottle. It's that good! Drink it over the next 5-6 years. A winner! France's leading consultant/oenologist, Michel Rolland, has had a significant influence on the quality of this Chilean estate's wines.

347,Domaine Bournet-Lapostolle,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon does not possess as dense a color, or the sheer flamboyant richness and up-front flattery of the Merlot.  Furthermore, it unfolds slowly in the glass. Nevertheless, it is a good, solid, medium-weight Cabernet with plenty of spicy, blackcurrant fruit, and good cleanliness, but a noticeably tough, tannic edge in the finish. It will lose its fruit before its tannin, so drink it over the next 3-4 years.
