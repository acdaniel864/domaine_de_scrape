0,Moret Nominee,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatieres is much more complex on the nose than the village cru: citrus lemon, flint and a touch of quince that is brimming over with energy, with a light marine elements emerging with time. The palate is vibrant and engaging with hazelnut and oyster shell informing the finish that is precise and long. Excellent. Drink 2014-2025.  

I was unfamiliar with the wines of David Moret until I chanced upon bottled 2012s in London. His first two wines in the line-up, the Rully and Saint Romain Village, were both exemplary for their respective appellations and subsequent crus went some way in justifying their not inexpensive price tags. David works out of his winery in Beaune and actually began his career selling winery equipment, the perfect way to introduce himself to local vignerons. By the late 1990s he was acquiring his first barrels. Since then he has purchased grapes that are always sourced from the same parcels of vine. New oak is used prudently, around 20% for the premier crus in order to express their terroirs, which they do with some style.

1,Moret Nominee,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrieres, which sees 40% new oak, has an appealing, quite intense bouquet with fresh lime and quince, well integrated oak and distant scents of limestone leading you to this exact premier cru vineyard. The palate is taut and crisp on the entry. The acidity is well judged, rendering this a poised wine with a flourish of lemongrass on the confident and long finish. This is a very commendable Les Perrieres and its harmony and persistency suggests that will repay cellaring. Drink now-2025.

2,Moret Nominee,Meursault 1er Cru Genevrières,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Genevrieres offers hints of almond and white peach on the nose, later lime cordial as it begins to motor. The palate is fresh and vigorous on the entry with touches of bitter lemon and quince. This Meursault is crisp and taut with a long, languorous finish and thus represents one of David’s best offerings in 2012. Drink now-2022.

3,Moret Nominee,Rully Village,"The 2012 Rully Village has a fragrant bouquet with lime flower and white peach aromas gently wafting from the glass. The aromatics are nicely focused. The palate is well-balanced and packed full of flavor. There is a fine thread of acidity here, coupled with a vibrant citric finish that rounds everything off nicely. This is a well-crafted Rully.

4,Moret Nominee,Saint-Romain Village,"The 2012 Saint Romain Village is more floral than the Rully Village with scents of orange blossom and lemon zest that is well-defined and composed. The palate is fresh and vibrant on the entry and it displays good extraction, with more body and volume than other 2012 Saint Romain. It finishes in satisfying fashion with a fresh spicy finish determined to make a positive impression...and it certainly does. Recommended at this price. Drink now-2020.

5,Moret Nominee,Meursault Les Narvaux,"The 2012 Meursault Narvaux is adorned with a crisp, mineral-driven bouquet, complemented by subtle notes of orange peel and white peach. This is fresh and vigorous. The palate is well-balanced with a crisp line of acidity, notes of quince and ginger infusing the citrus fruit, which then eases down a few gears to a sedate finish.

6,Moret Nominee,Meursault Sous La Velle,"The 2012 Meursault Sous la Velle has a light, petrol-tinged nose with mandarin and quince following after, the kind of bouquet you want to keep dunking your nose into. The palate has a hint of blackberry leaf on the entry and dried honey suggesting good ripeness at time of picking. With admirable length, this is a competent, appealing Meursault.

7,Moret Nominee,Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2012 Meursault 1er Cru Les Charmes has an engaging bouquet with grilled walnut, nettle and light almond scents unfolding in the glass. The palate does not quite meet the promise of the aromatics – but it is not far off. It is graced with attractive orange zest and bitter lemon notes, broadening out nicely on the satisfying, very “Charmes” finish. Very fine. Drink now-2020.

The palate is fresh on the entry. For a village cru, this boasts good weight in the mouth, although the muffled finish just shaves off a couple of points. Drink now-2017.

9,Oratoire Chanson,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1947 Richebourg Grand Cru starts out a touch wild and leathery, exhibiting some volatile phenols, but integrates surprisingly well in the glass to reveal aromas of rich red fruits and spices as well. Medium to full-bodied, impressively youthful and integrated, it's supple and seamless; it's just let down by the brettanomyces.",1947 Chanson Père & Fils Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 89
10,Oratoire Chanson,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Grands Suchots,"The 1955 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Grands Suchots was extraordinary, bursting from the glass with a rich bouquet of dark berry fruit, grilled game bird, spices and black truffles. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, lavishly textural and expansive, with a deep core of generous and still-lively fruit, succulent acids and supple, melted tannins, concluding with a long and flamboyant finish. This is a superb Suchots in a ripe, powerful register that has stood the test of time. ""Grands Suchots"" typically referred to the upper part of the vineyard.",1955 Chanson Père & Fils Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Grands Suchots,RP 89
11,Oratoire Chanson,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,"Of these two 1955s from Chanons, the 1955 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses had the lower fill and took longer to blossom with air than the Suchots served alongside. When it did, the results were striking, the wine wafting from the glass with aromas of creamy red berry fruit, rich spices, forest floor and dried flowers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, fleshy and muscular, with a broad, velvety attack, an ample chassis of fine but abundant tannins and a long, resonant finish. It's tempting to speculate that this bottle derived from Comte de Vogüé, but whatever its source, it was a first-rate old Burgundy. While the wine is ready to drink, it appears to be in no danger of decline any time soon.",1955 Chanson Père & Fils Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Amoureuses,RP 89
12,Oratoire Chanson,Montrachet Grand Cru,"The 1947 Montrachet Grand Cru is showing brilliantly, blossoming in the glass with complex aromas of dried white flowers, preserved citrus, warm bread and praline, with only subtle hints of walnut oil and sotolon pointing to its age. On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with immense power and concentration but no sense of excess, its creamy and textural attack segueing into a deep, multidimensional core that's effortlessly balanced, concluding with a long and resonant finish that displays no signs of fraying. Harmonious and lively, even in this warm vintage, this was a magical bottle that testified to the heights of which Montrachet was capable of hitting.",1947 Chanson Père & Fils Montrachet Grand Cru,RP 89
13,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,"This monopole has always been cited as one of Beaune's very finest terroirs, and the 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves has turned out very nicely. Bursting from the glass with a fragrant bouquet of raspberries, plums, peonies, bergamot and exotic spices, it's medium to full-bodied, supple and charming, with an enveloping core of fruit, succulent acids and melting tannins. But its charm is deceptive, as the underlying raw materials should vouchsafe at least two decades' longevity.",2017 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,RP 89
14,Oratoire Chanson,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode opens in the glass with a generous bouquet of wild berries, spices, grilled meat, dark chocolate and peonies. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, with a deep core of fruit, powdery structuring tannins and a sapid finish. As usual it's one of the estate's more structured offerings, but there's plenty of promise for the future here.",2017 Chanson Père & Fils Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode,RP 89
15,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches wafts from the glass with a classy bouquet of wild berry fruit, rose petal, spices and rich soil tones. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with a sapid core of fruit, powdery tannins and mouthwatering acids. This is a definite success chez Chanson.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches,RP 89
16,Oratoire Chanson,Corton Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Grand Cru offers up a lovely nose of ripe berry fruit, rose petals, spices and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and supple, with velvety tannins, good concentration and bright acids, concluding with a fragrant finish. This is one of the definite successes in the range.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Corton Grand Cru,RP 89
17,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves offers up aromas of dark berry fruit, baking chocolate, potpourri, exotic spices and smoked meats, followed by a medium to full-bodied, rich and fleshy palate with powdery structuring tannins and a generous core of sapid fruit. This is a strong showing for this Chandon monopole.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,RP 89
18,Oratoire Chanson,Santenay 1er Cru Beauregard,"Fragrant aromas of berry fruit, rose petals and cinnamon introduce the 2016 Santenay 1er Cru Beauregard, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy wine with powdery tannins, a juicy core of fruit and a long, almost extravagantly perfumed finish. This would appear to be quite strongly marked by whole cluster fermentation, and it has turned out very well indeed in its distinctive style.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Santenay 1er Cru Beauregard,RP 89
19,Oratoire Chanson,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières opens in the glass with a ripe, honeyed bouquet of peaches and orchard fruit. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, concluding with a saline finish. This is one of the more gourmand, concentrated whites in the Chanson range this year, and it should deliver plenty of near-term pleasure.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières,RP 89
20,Oratoire Chanson,Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières wafts from the glass with notions of green orchard fruit, dried white flowers, almond paste, honeycomb and light reduction. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, satiny and elegant, with ripe acids, moderate concentration and a pure, saline finish.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières,RP 89
21,Oratoire Chanson,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Haut Marconnets Blanc,"With aeration, reductive aromas dissipate sufficiently to reveal the bouquet of smoky green and yellow orchard fruit, introducing the 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Haut Marconnets Blanc. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, rich and textural, with racy acids and more concentration than most of Chanson's whites this year, presumably because of yields reduced by frost. Whatever the reason, the result is a success.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Haut Marconnets Blanc,RP 89
22,Oratoire Chanson,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode,"One of the deepest hued, most saturated wine in the Chanson range is the 2016 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode, a richly tannic, youthfully chewy Burgundy with good concentration and depth at the core and a bouquet of cassis, smoked meats and spices. This is quite tannic and extracted in profile, so it won't offer early accessibility, but the potential for positive evolution in bottle appears to be present.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode,RP 89
23,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Bastion,"Notes of light reduction framing a generous bouquet of honeyed orchard fruit introduce the 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Bastion, a fleshy, medium to full-bodied white with a generous, open-knit and fruit-driven profile. This is one of the most generous, charming wines in the Chanson range this year.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Bastion,RP 89
24,Oratoire Chanson,Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,"The 2016 Meursault 1er Cru Charmes unfurls in the glass with a ripe but reserved bouquet of peaches, apricot, almond paste and buttered citrus fruit. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with ripe acids, good mid-palate amplitude and a saline but somewhat ephemeral finish.  This Charmes exemplifies the richer, more gourmand side of the vintage.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Meursault 1er Cru Charmes,RP 89
25,Oratoire Chanson,Gevrey-Chambertin Village,"Aromas of spicy berry fruit, dried flowers and celery seed introduce the 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin Village. It's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a rich core of fruit, youthfully chewy tannins and a sapid finish. This has turned out quite well.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Gevrey-Chambertin Village,RP 89
26,Oratoire Chanson,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gains,"The 2016 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gains is quite reduced, opening with aeration to reveal aromas of ripe citrus and orchard fruits. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, pure and satiny textured, with ripe acids, moderate concentration and a slightly diffuse finish.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gains,RP 89
27,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc offers up a lightly reduced bouquet of smoky orchard fruit and citrus, followed by a medium to full-bodied, ample and delicately textural palate that's open-knit and misses the concentration necessary to score higher.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc,RP 89
28,Oratoire Chanson,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru La Perrière,"The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru La Perrière is showing quite well from bottle, offering up aromas of rose petal, potpourri and dark berry fruit that's quite marked by whole cluster fermentation. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with succulent acids, powdery tannins and an open-knit profile, concluding with a somewhat diffuse finish. This will offer a great deal of near-term charm, though it isn't especially profound and nor is it built for the long haul.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru La Perrière,RP 89
29,Oratoire Chanson,Corton Vergennes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton Vergennes Grand Cru offers up aromas of lemon oil, green apple and iodine, framed by rapidly dissipating reduction. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, open-knit and fleshy, with moderate concentration and ripe acids, falling a little flat on the finish.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Corton Vergennes Grand Cru,RP 89
30,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,"Aromas of strawberries, cherries, spices and mint introduce the 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi, a medium to full-bodied wine with supple tannins, a fleshy core of succulent fruit and a youthfully chewy finish that's a touch austere, depressing my score a little. While this can't match the depth or completeness of the Clos des Fèves, it's a creditable effort.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos du Roi,RP 89
31,Oratoire Chanson,Pommard 1er Cru Les Charmots,"Aromas of jammy berry fruit and herbs introduce the 2016 Pommard 1er Cru Les Charmots, a medium-bodied, open-knit wine with youthfully chewy tannins and a fleeting finish.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Pommard 1er Cru Les Charmots,RP 89
32,Oratoire Chanson,Viré-Clessé,"The 2016 Viré-Clessé bursts with aromas of orchard fruit and citrus blossom, followed by a medium to full-bodied, ample and satiny palate that's attractively lively and pure. This is a simple but nicely balanced white that, in the context of its appellation, is one of Chanson's more successful 2016s.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Viré-Clessé,RP 89
33,Oratoire Chanson,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"Tasted from bottle, 2016 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses offers up pretty notes of plum and cherry fruit mingled with notions of Indian spices and loamy soil. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied and expansive on the attack, but it's a little compact and austere on the back end, marred by tannic asperity.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,RP 89
34,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves bursts with aromas of spiced plums and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied but firm and drying, with chewy tannins and some overripe characteristics. This would appear to be a swing and a miss from Chanson this year.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Les Grèves,RP 89
35,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets offers more perfumed, red cherry fruit on the nose compared to the Teurons and Clos du Roi, well defined with good vigor. The palate is fresh and crisp on the entry with a fine bead of acidity, grainy in texture with touches of black truffle decorating the structured finish. Give this three of four years in bottle and you will have a delightful Beaune premier cru.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets,RP 89
36,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons has a little more detail on the nose compared to the Clos du Roi, tensile with a mixture of red and black fruit, sous bois and a little tobacco. The palate is medium-bodied with fine-grain tannin, edgy and maybe a little angular at the moment, although I like the focus and energy here and the tension all the way through to the finish. Very fine.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Les Teurons,RP 89
37,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru was a little underwhelming on the nose after tasting a string of very attractive Beaune premier crus. This appeared to lack a little fruité and complexity by comparison, rather dusty and stemmy. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, rather dry in the mouth compared to its peers, with brambly black fruit toward the supple, easy-going finish. Not bad, but it could have been better.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 89
38,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru les Clos,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru les Clos offers more vigor on the nose compared to the Bougros and Les Preuses from Chanson, although it still lacks the complexity and nerve you expect from a grand cru. The palate is well balanced with a sharp, sour lemon entry. There is plenty of lime mixed in with the citrus fruit and there is better length than the aforementioned grand crus, although I would still assert that it lags behind the decent 2015 last year.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru les Clos,RP 89
39,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru Bougros,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru Bougros has a pretty, light peach-scented bouquet with fine delineation and well-integrated oak. The palate is quite sharp and bitter on the entry, attacking on the entry but not following through with the requisite weight and concentration. Hopefully this will improve with some age.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru Bougros,RP 89
40,Oratoire Chanson,Meursault Village,"The 2016 Meursault Village had a light reduction on the nose but it is more measured than the Savigny-lès-Beaune Blanc. The palate is taut and ripe on the entry with sharp acidity, sour lemon mingling with citrus peel, with a short, punchy finish.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Meursault Village,RP 89
41,Oratoire Chanson,Chassagne-Montrachet Village,"The 2016 Chassagne-Montrachet Village has a light, simple, white flower-tinged bouquet that needs to show more vigor. The palate is rounded on the entry with a slightly honeyed texture, but it feels monochromatic and rather predictable on the finish. Upended by the growing season perhaps?",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Chassagne-Montrachet Village,RP 89
42,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses,"The 2016 Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses has a slightly dilute, waxy bouquet that requires more focus and vigor, especially for a grand cru. The palate is sour on the entry, almost mouth-puckeringly so, with a lack of complexity and terroir expression on the finish. This ought to be better.",2016 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses,RP 89
43,Oratoire Chanson,Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Chanson's 2014 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières was showing a touch of reduction on the nose, a very light ash/ember-like aroma that combines neatly with the flinty scents. The palate is fresh on the entry with a line of crisp acidity, well poised and saline with a dash of cracked black pepper on the finish. I was surprised how well this showed against its peers—chapeau!",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières,RP 89
44,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, Chanson's 2014 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru has a rather simple, slightly monotone bouquet with redcurrant and strawberry fruit, but it lacks complexity and mineralité. The palate is medium-bodied with evidence of some whole-bunch fruit, well-judged acidity and a slightly stalky but balanced finish. It actually is not a million miles away from Dujac in style. I think the aromatics will improve with time, though it does come across very dry on the aftertaste. Tasted September 2017.",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 89
45,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2014 tasting, the 2014 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets has an elegant bouquet that leans squarely upon red fruit: strawberry and raspberry preserves, a pleasant touch of orange rind surfacing with aeration. The palate is well balanced with a supple, fresh and crisp entry. I adore the fruit profile here: vibrant strawberry and cranberry notes, a slight bitterness toward the finish that keeps this Beaune on its toes. It might lack length, but this is a very decent Beaune premier cru from Chanson. Tasted September 2017.",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Marconnets,RP 89
46,Oratoire Chanson,Corton Vergennes Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Chanson's 2014 Corton Vergennes Grand Cru is very reduced on the nose and this detracts from typicity—it could come from anywhere (or at least from any winemaker pursuing a Coche-Dury-like reduction!). The palate is well balanced with a soft opening and lower acidity than I would anticipate from the 2014 vintage, with a fluffy, brioche-tinged finish. Drink sooner rather than later.",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Corton Vergennes Grand Cru,RP 89
47,Oratoire Chanson,Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes,"Tasted blind at the annual Burgfest tasting, Chanson's 2014 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes was showing some reduction at first, but there is plenty of fruit behind it. It's not quite as clean as the best Chassagne-Montrachet and has a tang of mothballs. The palate is balanced with a waxy-textured opening and notes of apricot and Golden Delicious apples that lead to a straightforward, lightly spiced finish that tapers prematurely. This will be an earlier drinking Chassagne-Montrachet.",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes,RP 89
48,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru les Clos,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru les Clos has a simple, limestone and slate-scented bouquet that could do with a little more personality. The palate is balanced with a smear of honey on the entry, quite resinous in styl, with stone fruit toward the broody finish. Give this two or three years in bottle and you should have a decent, if not exceptional, les Clos.",2015 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru les Clos,RP 89
49,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses,"The 2015 Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses was marred by some SO2 on the nose that detracted from terroir expression. The palate is better with a fine bead of acidity. There is plenty of crisp, quite spicy and tropical-influenced fruit. It is not an intellectual les Preuses, but with a couple of years in bottle, it should come good.",2015 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru les Preuses,RP 89
50,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis,"The 2015 Chablis has a very Zen-like, struck flint-scented bouquet with touches of apple blossom in the background. The palate is balanced but simpler than the aromatics portend, and it lacks tension and mineralité on the flatlining finish. This should be better.",2015 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis,RP 89
51,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgfest tasting in Beaune, the 2013 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru was more advanced in appearance than its peers. I thought perhaps there was some stem addition here. It certainly seems that way on the nose with an attractive stemminess filtering through the red berry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, fine acidity, very well balanced with genuine complexity and nuance on the finish. There is something enigmatic about this Charmes-Chambertin and I look forward to seeing how it matures. Chanson deserves much credit for this excellent Grand Cru that out-gunned a lot of famous names under blind conditions.

The 2013 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes has a rather muddled bouquet at the moment and is missing the focus of its peers. Citrus fruit, dried honey and waxy scents, but this just needs a little more detail to come through. The palate is medium-bodied with a pleasurable entry, grapefruit, melon and honey with a saline undertow. Modest in length but nicely composed, I would broach this Chassagne-Montrachet over the next 8-10 years. Tasted May 2016.",2013 Chanson Père & Fils Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes,RP 89
53,Oratoire Chanson,Corton Vergennes Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Corton Vergennes Grand Cru has a forward and quite powerful bouquet with notes of dried honey and brioche infusing the citrus fruit, rich but unlike several Corton-Charlemagnes from this vintage, I don't find too much botrytis here. The palate is waxy on the entry with perhaps a little too much lime. It feels balanced with noticeable oak, the finish predictable and missing some precision and mineralité.

54,Oratoire Chanson,Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatieres,"Tasted blind at the annual “Burgfest” tasting in Bouilland. The 2013 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières was showing too much sulfur dioxide on the nose that shaves away some of its precision. The palate is better with a balanced opening, plenty of lime zest and Granny Smith apple, although it feels a little curt and abrupt towards the finish.

55,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru Bourgros,"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru Bougros sees partial fermentation and maturation in demi-muids. It has a well-defined bouquet, plenty of fresh lime complementing the Granny Smith apples, although it does not quite deliver the mineralité of its peers. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, harmonious and linear, fresh and spicy towards the composed finish that has class. It is not giving too much away at the moment, but with 3-5 years this could evolve into a great Bougros. ",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru Bourgros,RP 89
56,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis 1Er Cru Fourchaume,"The 2014 Chablis 1Er Cru Fourchaume has a slightly more floral bouquet than its peers with yellow flower scents permeating the citrus peel and green apple aromas. The palate is fresh and vibrant with a keen thread of acidity, a sorbet-like freshness intact with a vibrant orange zest finish that forsakes mineralité for crowd-pleasing exuberance. It is just a delicious Chablis from Chanson. ",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis 1Er Cru Fourchaume,RP 89
57,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,"The 2014 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur was raised in vat and demi-muids in equal proportion. It was showing a little too much reduction on the nose, depriving it of delineation and terroir expression. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, a pleasant saline drift towards the finish, but I wanted more weight and persistence on the finish. I suspect that the Bougros will be the better Chablis Grand Cru from Chanson.",2014 Chanson Père & Fils Chablis Grand Cru Valmur,RP 89
58,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis 1Er Cru Montmains,"The 2014 Chablis 1Er Cru Montmains saw partial maturation in demi-muids.

59,Oratoire Chanson,Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at Fine & Rare Wines' Clos Vougeot tasting, the 2013 Clos Vougeot Grand Cru from Chanson seemed a little enervated on the nose, missing the fruit intensity and the charm of Bouchard Père.

60,Oratoire Chanson,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru from Chanson, Baston de l'Oratoire has a slightly volatile, soy-tinged nose that redeems itself by some very intense and attractive red fruits. With time it evolves more tertiary, gravelly scents. The palate is medium-bodied with firm, slightly dry tannins. This feels a little tarry in the mouth at the moment due to the amount of unresolved oak, a little brutish on the finish but there is plenty of charm here. ""Bit of a bruiser"" as they say, but a bruiser you'll want to spend time with. This was one of the shock results of the blind tasting, but it's averaged score was higher than any other Clos-de-Bèze with the sole exception of Rousseau.

61,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Feves from Chanson has a leafy, herbaceous nose and is rather stalky in style, though nicely defined and showing more fruit intensity than Chanson’s Clos des Mouches. The palate is medium-bodied with a saline entry, and is nicely balanced with broody, dark fruit. It feels a little angular and attenuates slightly on the finish, although there is appreciable sustain on the aftertaste, again, demonstrating a subtle marine/seaweed influence. Returning after five minutes, it has coalesced and gained more substance, subsuming that initial stalky element and showing some class. ",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,RP 84
62,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc from Chanson has a slightly disjointed nose at first, flinty and smoky, some SO2 needing to be fully subsumed. The palate is well balanced but does not possess the complexity of its peers. It seems a little commercial and ""punter friendly"" on the finish. Nothing wrong with that, but it lags behind others in this blind flight. ",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Blanc,RP 84
63,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Charmes Chambertin Grand Cru from Chanson has a very candied nose with desiccated orange peel merging with red berry fruit, a touch of freshly uprooted beetroot developing with continued aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, a bit ""blocky"" at the moment, masculine, pushed a little to hard on the beetroot-tinged, very stemmy finish that needs to manifest more finesse and terroir expression.

64,Oratoire Chanson,Corton-Vergennes Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2012 tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Corton Vergennes Grand Cru from Chanson has a forward and disconcertingly mature nose that seems eight to ten-years-old rather than just two or three. The palate just seems to be going nowhere, rather flat and enervated, static and bereft of that crucial element of tension. This is a bit of a disappointment following its performance just after bottling and on this showing, I would drink this sooner rather than later.

The 2012 Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru les Chenevottes from Chanson is discombobulated by too much sulfur on the nose and it lacks the fruit concentration of say, Philippe Colins’ Chassagne 2012 whites. The palate is balanced but simple. Overall it seems a little flat-footed and missing some tension and nervosité towards the finish. I would play it safe and drink this over the next couple of years.

66,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches,"Tasted blind at the annual ""Burgfest"" tasting in Beaune. The 2012 Beaune 1Er Cru Clos des Mouches from Chanson has a dustiness on the nose that takes a few swirls of the glass to dispel. Compared to others, this feels herbaceous and a bit lean. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannin, a dusting of coca and a dry, rather austere finish. This is old-fashioned, rustic Burgundy that seems to have lost some of its initial promise.",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches,RP 84

The 2012 Puligny Montrachet 1er Cru les Folatières from Chanson tasted well a few months ago but here it showed just a little SO2 on the nose but it should clear up with time. The palate is showing just a touch of botrytis on the entry, quite honeyed in style and consequently missing tension and complexity on the finish. This was a vexing showing - but not the only one in a flight of Folatières 2012s. ",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières,RP 84
68,Oratoire Chanson,Morgon,"The 2013 Morgon is matured in the same manner as the Fleurie, though it offers more precision on the nose, with baked cherries and undergrowth scents developing. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy, ripe red fruit, well-judged acidity and a gentle grip on the structured finish. There’s a bit of authority in the Morgon, and it should offer several years of drinking pleasure.",2013 Chanson Père & Fils Morgon,RP 84
69,Oratoire Chanson,Fleurie,"The 2013 Fleurie was aged for 10 months in 40% oak casks. It has a light black cherry and cranberry-scented nose that needs a little bottle age to fully subsume the wood. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannin, quite grippy in the mouth, but requiring more precision on the finish. Frankly, I found much more Beaujolais character and joie-de-vivre in the Morgon this year.",2013 Chanson Père & Fils Fleurie,RP 84
70,Oratoire Chanson,Corton-Vergennes Grand Cru,"Tasted blind in London, the 2006 Corton Vergennes Grand Cru has an attractive lemon-thyme and sherbet-tinged nose that is attractive if not terribly complex.

The Beaune Clos des Feves from Chanson has a ripe red cherry and bergamot-scented nose, slightly tinny at first, although that dissipates with time as it becomes more candied and pastille-like. The palate is structured, a little aloof on the entry. The acidity is nicely judged and there is good extraction on the finish that obviously needs another couple of years to mellow and coalesce.

The Chassagne-Montrachet 1ere Cru les Chenevottes 2011 is taciturn on the nose, initially not quite as defined as its peers, although it unfolds with aeration, offering wet limestone and bruised apple scents. The palate is assertive and punchy, slightly overworked compared to the previous wine with touches of dried honey, quince and orange peel furnishing the finish that has better delineation that the nose suggests.

74,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Tasted blind at the Burgundy 2011 horizontal tasting in Beaune. The Charmes-Chambertin 2011 from Chanson has a more understated bouquet that demands more coaxing, eventually revealing spicy red cherries, wild strawberry and cooked meat scents that draw you in. The palate is medium-bodied with juicy ripe tannins. It feels quite solid in the mouth: good weight but missing a modicum on tension, therefore the finish is missing the finesse and grace one is looking for in a top Charmes-Chambertin.

The Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Chaines Carteaux has a vibrant, joyous bouquet with tart red cherries, hints of blueberry and wilted violets that open nicely in the glass. The palate is quite firm in the mouth, surprisingly so after the nose. Perhaps just a little “pushed,"" the tannins feel quite obdurate and the finish consequently truncated, but it does improve with time and gains more cohesion.

Chanson’s Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 2011 has quite an opulent and ripe bouquet with hints of dried honey, lemon curd and petrol scents that emerges with aeration and end up dominating the aromatics. The palate seems to have a fine line of acidity, quite rich but controlled: lemon rind, dried mango and honeysuckle augmented with a dash of spice toward the finish that does not quite have the delineation or tension to round things off in suitable fashion. This becomes more and more oxidative with aeration, which is concerning.",2011 Chanson Père & Fils Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 84
78,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Les Bressandes,"The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Bressandes has perhaps the purest bouquet of Chanson’s premier crus this year with lifted, perfumed cassis, blackberry and violets scents, and underlying mineralite that should be enhanced with bottle age. The palate is sweet and supple on the entry, fleshy and generous with lush red berry fruit, fine tannins and a sense of assuredness on the finish. Drink now-2024.

Lucid purple in color, it has a precocious nose for a 2012 with iodine-stained cassis and blueberry fruit that deserve one or two years to settle. The palate is fruit-driven and for some reason, reminiscent of a Marsannay in style with sweet, ripe cassis fruit, plenty of glycerin and a primal, perhaps slightly obvious finish that will need to demonstrate its premier cru credentials with age. It is a hedonistic delight, but it needs to show a little more class. Drink 2016-2024.

There is a sense of vitality and exuberance on the nose with plush black cherry and cassis fruit that is very engaging.

96,Oratoire Chanson,Meursault Village,"The 2012 Meursault, of which just over 50% originates from Vireuils and Cloux, is vinified in mainly used barrels with around 15% new oak for between 16 months. The nose is well-defined with attractive apricot blossom and praline scents. The palate is crisp on the entry, harmonious, although not complex. But it retains decent freshness and has an agreeable light peach-tinged finish. Fine. Drink now-2017.

97,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Champs Pimont,"The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Champimonts (one of Beaune’s finest premier crus in my opinion) has an outgoing bouquet with macerated dark cherries, violet and faint marmalade scents that are well-defined. The palate is medium-bodied with crisp, chewy tannins. There is a lot of substance here and I just feel that the wood protrudes a little on the austere finish. Drink 2016-2023.

98,Oratoire Chanson,Santenay 1er Cru Beauregard,"The 2012 Santenay 1er Cru Beauregard comes from 1.5 hectares from one main block located close to the windmill and two satellite blocks further down the slope. It has a deep, slightly rustic, black tea-scented bouquet that is broody but well-defined. The palate is medium-bodied with firm structure, quite dry and foursquare, serious and broody with a slight astringency toward the finish. I would have just shortened the maceration a little. Drink 2015-2021.

99,Oratoire Chanson,Marsannay Village,"The 2012 Marsannay comes from about 4.5 hectares of vines from around the commune, the grapes picked by Chanson’s own team. It has a nice deep garnet color. The nose is ripe and generous with cranberry and blackberry notes, touches of dried rose petal in the background but maintaining the exuberance you seek in a Marsannay. The palate is medium-bodied with fine grip – quite masculine with chewy tannins and a firm, grippy finish that suggests another year in bottle will help this mellow out. Drink 2015-2021.

100,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Bastion,"The 2012 Beaune 1er Cru Bastion comes from two parcels from the top of the Marconnets, located on marl/limestone soils, with a majority of the vines planted in 2000. It has a light and simple, citrus-peel nose that needs a little more vigor and charm. The palate is well-balanced with attractive, slightly resinous citrus fruit with decent weight on the finish. Drink now-2017.

101,Oratoire Chanson,Macon la Roche Vineuse,"The 2012 Macon La Roche Vineuse is now one of Chanson’s main wines in the Maconnais. It has a clean and fresh, slightly austere bouquet at first, although it unwinds nicely in the glass. The palate is clean and fresh, with sour lemon and a touch of orange rind on the entry, quite spicy on the front palate with a short and punchy, fresh finish. Drink now-2016.  

Importer: Terlato International and Mentzendorff (UK)",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Macon la Roche Vineuse,RP 84
102,Oratoire Chanson,Saint Veran,"The 2012 Saint Veran is equipped with good intensity on the nose: hints of lemon curd and shaved almond here. The palate is simple and balanced, a little soft in the mouth and perhaps needing more backbone toward the finish, but there is good persistency. Fine. Drink now-2016.  

Importer: Terlato International and Mentzendorff (UK)",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Saint Veran,RP 84
103,Oratoire Chanson,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru En Caradeux Blanc,"The 2012 Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Caradeux comes from two hectares of vine planted in 1955, with Pinot Blanc and then a hectare of Chardonnay in 1992. It has a rather simple, slightly dusty bouquet that needs to demonstrate more fruite. The palate is better than the nose with chewy citrus fruit and good acidity, although it feels quite foursquare on the finish. Drink now-2016.

104,Oratoire Chanson,Puligny-Montrachet Village,"The 2012 Puligny-Montrachet Villages, coming mainly from just under the climat of La Moucheres, has a light, crisp nose that lacks quite the same vigor as the Meursault. The palate is clean and fresh on the entry but lacking complexity on the slightly anonymous finish. Drink now-2016.  

Importer: Terlato International and Mentzendorff (UK)",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Puligny-Montrachet Village,RP 84
105,Oratoire Chanson,Bourgogne Chardonnay,"The 2012 Bourgogne Chardonnay comes from mostly the Cote de Beaune and the Cote Chalonnaise and is vinified 15% in oak demi-muids. It has a bright and lively bouquet with touches of almond and brioche that is nicely detailed for a Bourgogne Chardonnay. The palate is crisp on the entry with pointed acidity, although I feel it needs more substance on the back-palate to justify the attractive aromatics. Drink now.  There is no oak used in any of Chanson’s Maconnais wines.

106,Oratoire Chanson,Chassagne-Montrachet Village,"The 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet is sourced around half from Chanson’s own vines and supplemented by contracted fruit, mainly from the northern side of the village. It has a light, slightly earthy bouquet that needs more vigor and more of Chassagne’s joie-de-vivre. The palate has a pleasing entry of red apple and a hint of mandarin, moderate acidity, but a rather foursquare finish. Drink now-2016.  

Importer: Terlato International and Mentzendorff (UK)",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Chassagne-Montrachet Village,RP 84
107,Oratoire Chanson,Rully Village,"The 2012 Rully has a straightforward nose with green-apple and lemon peel, although it needs more vigor and personality. The palate is clean but rather simple, an easy-drinking Rully to enjoy over the next year. Drink now-2015.  

Importer: Terlato International and Mentzendorff (UK)",2012 Chanson Père & Fils Rully Village,RP 84
108,Oratoire Chanson,Chablis 1Er Cru Montmains,"The 2012 Chablis 1er Cru Montmains has a rather sullen, inarticulate nose that does little even with vigorous aeration. The palate is balanced and primal with light grassy notes toward the monotone finish. This is a very unresponsive showing. Drink now-2016.

109,Oratoire Chanson,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Haut Marconnets Blanc,"The 2012 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru Hauts Marconnets comes from two hectares of vineyard that was transferred from Pinot Noir to Chardonnay in the mid-1990s. There is a slight SO2 reduction on the nose that slightly suppresses the fruit and terroir expression. The palate is also a little smudged by the sulfur and consequently it is missing definition and finesse on the finish. This is difficult to read at the moment.

110,Oratoire Chanson,Vire Clesse,"The 2011 Vire-Clesse has a clean, ripe citrus and almond tinged nose. The palate is very simple, but it is clean and fresh with a light patisserie finish.

Like other negociants based further north in the Cote d’Or, the Macon offerings were a little inconsistent, though two stepped up to the mark.

No known US importer.",2011 Chanson Père & Fils Vire Clesse,RP 87
111,Oratoire Chanson,Macon la Roche Vineuse,"The 2011 Macon-La Roche-Vineuse has a lifted bouquet with apple peel, pear and a touch of nectarine that is well-defined but needs more vigor. The palate is nicely balanced with hints of white peach and nectarine on the entry, and a touch of spice on the sidelines, although the finish shows some attenuation and dryness. Drink now.

112,Oratoire Chanson,Fleurie,"Recent quality enhancements under the new owners of old line Beaune negociant Chanson extend to their line of Beaujolais, as witness this 2006 Fleurie. Tart purple plum, toasted pecan, soy, and wet stone mingle in a juicy, refined, by no means simple wine that is ripe, free of superficial sweetness and with satisfying length.

113,Oratoire Chanson,Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru,"The Chanson 2005 Chambertin Clos de Beze displays a lovely nose of black fruits, tea, citrus zest, rose petal and roasted red meat. Impressively clear and bright in the mouth, this packs in abundant, fine-grained tannin and finishes brightly and authoritatively with blackberry, licorice, black tea, salted, roasted meat, and chalk dust. It seems capable of improving over a 7-10 year period. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

114,Oratoire Chanson,Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Black cherry, mulberry, rose hips and charred meat inform both the nose and palate of Chanson’s 2005 Charmes Chambertin. Overtly chalky and with bitter-sweet , toasted nut character adding to the concentrated black fruits and meat, this finishes with a savory, saliva-stimulating brightness, its substantial, firm tannins never getting in the way. It is a good bet for at least 5-7 years in the cellar. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

115,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Les Bressandes,"Chanson’s 2005 Beaune Bressandes smells darkly of black raspberry, iodine and roasted meats. Subtly glossy in mouth feel though possessed of abundant, fine-grained tannins, it finishes with a piquant, invigoratingly juicy, though rather bitterly concentrated finish featuring tart black fruit skin, singed red meat, iodine and wet stone. This should nicely reward at least 5-7 years in someone’s cellar. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

116,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Fèves,"From a little-known monopole situated above Cent Vignes, Chanson’s 2005 Beaune Clos des Feves shares with its better-known neighbor high-toned aromas of cherry and cherry pit. In the mouth, licorice, cherry pit, brown spices and wet stones mingle with promising dynamic against a backdrop of firm, fine tannins, and a decidedly bitter-sweet and stony concentration completes a picture that promises positive development over the next several years. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

117,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches,"From Chanson’s substantial portion of this famous vineyard comes a 2005 Beaune Clos des Mouches redolent of fresh blackberries, cinnamon, cedar and smoked meat. Firm and substantial on the palate, this finishes with concentrated tart fruit skin, solid meatiness of both flavor and texture, and faintly gum-numbing tannins. As with most of the Chanson 2005s I tasted ( a rather rough and dry-finishing Clos Vougeot excepted) this seems to have enough vivacity and intensity of fruit to ride out the tannins over a few years. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

118,Oratoire Chanson,Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Les Vergelesses,"The 2005 Pernand-Vergelesses Les Vergelesses smells brightly of sour cherry , cherry pit, and smoked meats. Decidedly saline and savory in the mouth, with bitter-sweet, cherry-dominated flavors, this finishes with an interesting juxtaposition of bracing salinity and a slightly hard stoniness. I would be tempted to enjoy this now for its vivacious fruit, but two or three years may fill out the finish and add some depth. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

119,Oratoire Chanson,Beaune 1er Cru Champs Pimont,"The 2005 Beaune Champimonts – from a high elevation site whose name is subject to alternate spellings – offers an alluring nose of ripe purple plum, black cherry and sea breezes. Brine-crusted fresh plum, cherry pits and wet stones inform this Pinot’s concentrated palate impression. Like a number of the Chanson 2005s, it wears its tannins rather obviously, finishing with a touch of austerity, but I would not mind betting on this wine’s improving over 3-5 years in my cellar. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).

120,Oratoire Chanson,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru La Dominode,"Blackberry, sassafras, black tea and smoked meat inform the nose of Chanson’s 2005 Savigny-les-Beaune Dominodes. Impressively concentrated on the palate, with even more raw fruit intensity than its Pernand stable mate, and with tea-like inner-mouth aromatics and tannins, this finishes with mouth-coating but slightly numbing tannins which a bit longer post-bottling interval may help to resolve. Also recommended: 2005 Beaune Teurons (85).
