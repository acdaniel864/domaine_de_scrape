0,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"A rare disappointment from an estate that, at its best, produces what I consider to be the world's greatest wines, the 2009 Richebourg Grand Cru is rich and exotic but dominated by rather planky new oak. What went wrong?",2009 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 88
1,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Lalou Bize-Leroy's 2001 Richebourg Grand Cru is drinking brilliantly, entirely transcending early estimates of the vintage's quality.

2,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1997 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is a brilliant effort in this ultimately somewhat underrated white Burgundy vintage. Offering up a complex bouquet of crisp orchard fruit, mandarin, confit lemon, wheat toast, iodine and nicely integrated reduction, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and chiseled, with good concentration and chalky structuring extract. While it isn't as overtly muscular as some vintages of this bottling, it's pure, vibrant and drinking beautifully today.",1997 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 88
3,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Leroy's 2011 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is exquisitely elegant and refined in this vintage, unfurling in the glass with notions of raspberries and plums mingled with hints of exotic spices, potpourri, loamy soil and musk.

4,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2019 Chambertin Grand Cru continues this cuvée's extraordinary run of success. Unwinding in the glass with rich aromas of plums and berries mingled with orange rind, black truffles, dark chocolate, violets and spices, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and complete, with a deep and layered core, lively acids and a long, resonant finish. This is another monument in the making from Lalou Bize-Leroy.",2019 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 88
5,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2019 Musigny Grand Cru more than met my lofty expectations. Unfurling in the glass with aromas of raspberries and blood orange mingled with floral notes of peonies, rose and violet petals, alongside notions of incense and Indian spices, its full-bodied, deep and seamless, displaying immense concentration and exquisitely refined tannins and concluding with a long, saline, rose-inflected finish. Bize-Leroy describes tasting a glass as ""like falling into a well,"" a description so evocative that it risks making my commentary redundant.",2019 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 88
6,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2019 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is another spectacular rendition of this routinely profound cuvée. Wafting from the glass with aromas of raspberries, cherries, rose petals, peonies, violets, incense, orange oil and exotic spices, it's full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with a broad attack and a layered, multidimensional mid-palate.

7,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2019 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is especially striking this year. Offering up aromas of wild berries, peonies, exotic spices, coniferous forest floor, orange rind and violets, it's full-bodied, vibrant and multidimensional, with a concentrated core of fruit and an incisive, penetrating profile. Elegant and precise, it's one of the most refined wines in the cellar.",2019 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 88
8,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The fireworks continue with the 2019 Richebourg Grand Cru, a striking wine that unfurls in the glass with aromas of raspberries, blackberries and plums mingled with exotic spices, dark chocolate, orange rind and peonies. Full-bodied, rich and muscular, it's deep and broad-shouldered, its ample core of fruit framed by prodigious reserves of ripe, powdery tannin and lively girdling acids. Impeccably balanced and built for the long haul, it will demand—and amply reward—patience.",2019 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 88
9,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"A more than worthy follow-up to the profound 2018, Leroy's striking 2019 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts unwinds in the glass with aromas of inky berry fruit, cassis, sweet spices, smoked duck, rich soil tones, orange oil and incense. Full-bodied, velvety and concentrated, it's seamless and multidimensional, with lively acids, velvety tannins and a long, penetrating finish. This is less demonstrative than the extroverted Brûlées, but it's even deeper and more incipiently complex.",2019 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 88
10,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2019 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is extraordinary, unfurling in the glass with scents of raspberries, plums and pomegranate mingled with rose petals, orange oil and exotic spices.

If anything, this is one 2019 that's more youthfully reserved than its 2018 counterpart was at the same stage. This will require patience, but it's a monument in the making.",2019 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 88
12,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Leroy's brilliant 2019 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru unfurls in the glass with aromas of orange oil, raspberries and cherries mingled with rose petals, rich spices and sweet soil tones.

Full-bodied, layered and velvety, it's deep and concentrated, with a textural attack that segues into an ample core of vibrant fruit and a long, expansive finish. Sensual and charming, to the extent that there's an ""underrated"" wine chez Leroy, this cuvée is it.",2019 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 88
16,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2019 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is rich and unctuous, wafting from the glass with aromas of citrus oil, pear, waxy lemon rind, honeycomb and toasted sesame. Full-bodied, deep and textural, it's rich and enveloping, with a huge core of fleshy fruit underpinned by lively acids and chalky structuring extract.",2019 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 88
17,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2019 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières bursts with aromas of raspberries, orange rind, rose petals, forest floor, exotic spices and incense. Full-bodied, layered and sumptuous, with an enveloping core of fruit complemented by sapid, even carnal nuances and framed by melting tannins and lively acids, its depth and plenitude transcend any exceptions for a communal appellation.

18,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2019 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées wafts from the glass with a rich and carnal bouquet of dark berries, plums, exotic spices, smoked meats, rose petals and classy new oak.

19,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2019 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is less extroverted than the brilliant Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, but it's every bit as good. Unwinding in the glass with scents of raspberries, cherries, blood orange and rose petals, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, exhibiting almost crystalline purity of fruit and seamless integration. Concluding with a long, mineral finish, it's a legend in the making.",2019 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 88
20,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Offering up aromas of plums, cassis, burning embers, warm spices, rose petals and discreet hints of toasty new oak, Leroy's 2019 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is medium to full-bodied, ample and enveloping, its powdery tannins and lively girdling acids entirely concealed in its layered, multidimensional core of fruit.

22,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"As readers will remember, when yields are small, Lalou Bize-Leroy opts to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières, and that's the case for her 2019 Nuits-Saint-Georges. Opening in the glass with aromas of sweet red berries, plums, warm spices, loamy soil, black truffle and orange oil, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, with a rich core of fruit, supple tannins and a seamless, giving profile.",2019 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 88

As I predicted when I last reviewed it, it will require—and requite—patience.",2015 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 88
26,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"After a prolonged slumber, the 1996 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is at last beginning to drink beautifully, wafting from the glass with a captivating bouquet of peonies, exotic spices, plummy fruit tones and ineffable carnal nuances. Full-bodied, velvety and layered, it's deep and concentrated, with its racy, vintage-typical spine of acidity cloaked in fruit. Long, penetrating and sapid, it's a real success that's evolving very gracefully. In fact, I suspect that with further bottle age, the gap between the 1996 and the 1993 and 1999 will narrow.",1996 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 88
27,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Approaching maturity, Leroy's 1993 Chambertin Grand Cru is a magical wine, wafting from the glass with complex aromas of dark berry fruit, peonies and wilted rose petals, mingled with hints of musk, sweet soil tones and orange rind. Full-bodied, deep and layered, it's still tightly wound, with a racy spine of acidity and fine, powdery tannins framing its core of intensely concentrated fruit. Concluding with a long, perfumed finish, it comes across as a somewhat more brooding, austere stylistic cousin to the stunning 2001 Chambertin—another year when Leroy crafted some of the wines of the vintage.",1993 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 88
28,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Richer and rounder than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, Leroy's 2018 Richebourg Grand Cru bursts with aromas of wild berries, exotic spices, hoisin sauce, orange rind and rose petals. Full-bodied, multidimensional and enveloping, it's deep and layered, with velvety tannins and a sumptuous core of fruit. Long and perfumed, it's a head-turningly exotic Richebourg that's built for the ages. It was cropped at a mere 14 hectoliters per hectare.",2018 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 88
29,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"""Here's the 1955 at last,"" exclaimed Lalou Bize-Leroy—alluding to the legendary 1955 Maison Leroy Chambertin, the wine she cites as the model for what she aspires to achieve at Domaine Leroy—as we tasted the 2018 Chambertin Grand Cru, and it's hard not to share her enthusiasm. Mingling deep aromas of sweet berries and plums with hints of licorice, peonies, incense and spices, complemented by savory, carnal bass notes, this is a full-bodied, deep and multidimensional wine that's seamless and complete, with a layered core framed by powdery tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, sapid finish.

30,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2018 Musigny Grand Cru is another monument in the making from Domaine Leroy. Unfurling in the glass a deep bouquet of wild berries, rose petals, spices, blood orange and musk, it's full-bodied, layered and multidimensional, with huge reserves of concentration—""il y a du vin,"" observes Bize-Leroy—and ripe, powdery tannins. Deep and complete, it's unerringly balanced, concluding with a penetrating, perfumed finish. This is not simply built to age, but rather built for eternity; and yet there's nothing austere about this magical Musigny.",2018 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 88
31,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2018 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is a profound young wine, unwinding in the glass with a captivating bouquet of red berries, plums and orange rind mingled with exotic spices, rose hips, peonies and smoke. Full-bodied and deep, it's layered and concentrated, with a seamless, multidimensional profile, bright animating acids and ripe, powdery tannins. Long and resonant, this is an incipiently dramatic but youthfully tightly wound Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will reward extended bottle age with remarkable aromatic range and textural sumptuousness. Cropped at 11.5 hectoliters per hectare, only 1,160 bottles were produced.",2018 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 88
32,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2018 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is spectacular, offering up a deep and carnal bouquet of wild berries, smoked duck and plums mingled with hints of rose hip, warm spices and rich soil tones.

Full-bodied, seamless and complete, it's deep and concentrated, with a cool core of fruit; rich, powdery tannins; lively acids; and a long, penetrating finish. As ever, its finesse and tension distinguish it from the broader-shouldered, more muscular Clos de la Roche.",2018 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 88
34,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Cropped at a paltry 15 hectoliters per hectare, the 2018 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is a worthy rival to the Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaumonts this year. Unwinding in the glass with scents of raspberries, wild berries, rose petals, exotic spices, orange rind, violets and sweet soil tones, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and intense, with lively acids, velvety structuring tannins and a long, perfumed finish.",2018 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 88
35,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2018 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a particular success, offering up aromas of plums, dark berries, smoked meats, hoisin and spices, followed by a full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping palate that's deep and textural, its huge reserves of tannin largely concealed by its generous core of fruit. While that structure imposes itself on the finish, the maturity of the vintage has tempered some of this site's proclivity to youthful reserve—at least for now.",2018 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 88
36,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Notes of red berries, wild plums, woodsmoke, sweet soil tones and rose hip introduce Leroy's 2018 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru, a full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine that's velvety and vibrant, with a bright spine of acidity and ripe, powdery tannins.

38,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Notes of sweet berries, spices, orange rind, rose petals and loamy soil, framed by a deft patina of new oak, introduce Leroy's 2018 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru, a full-bodied, rich and concentrated wine that's muscular and fleshy, with a tightly wound core, powdery tannins and a long, penetrating finish. Like the Clos de Vougeot, this is another of the portfolio's habitually more reserved wines that is—comparatively speaking—unusually demonstrative this year.",2018 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 88
39,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of honeyed pears, white flowers, hazelnuts, wet stones, mandarin oil and apricot introduce Leroy's 2018 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine built around lively acids and chalky structuring dry extract. Long and penetrating, it's a comparatively giving, sun-kissed rendition of this sometimes austerely mineral cuvée.",2018 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 88
40,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is superb, unwinding in the glass with youthfully reserved suggestions of blackberries, smoke, rose petals, spices and grilled squab.

48,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"As is often the case when yields are small, Lalou Bize-Leroy opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single cuvée of 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges.

49,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2001 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a magical wine, soaring from the glass with scents of peonies, wild berries, orange rind, wilted rose petals and warm spices. Full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, this has an ample core of fruit, melting tannins and a bright spine of acidity; and it's that spine that distinguishes it from the similarly charming, perfumed but also softer, suppler 2000 vintage. Long and penetrating, this Clos de Vougeot is just entering early maturity.",2001 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 88
50,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"A rare disappointment from an estate that, at its best, produces what I consider to be the world's greatest wines, the 2009 Richebourg Grand Cru is rich and exotic but dominated by rather planky new oak.

Offering up a complex bouquet of crisp orchard fruit, mandarin, confit lemon, wheat toast, iodine and nicely integrated reduction, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and chiseled, with good concentration and chalky structuring extract. While it isn't as overtly muscular as some vintages of this bottling, it's pure, vibrant and drinking beautifully today.",1997 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 88
53,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Leroy's 2011 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is exquisitely elegant and refined in this vintage, unfurling in the glass with notions of raspberries and plums mingled with hints of exotic spices, potpourri, loamy soil and musk.

56,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is still quite tight-knit and reserved, opening in the glass with aromas of cassis and wild plums, mingled with notions of smoked meats, incense, rich soil tones and peonies. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, built around an ample chassis of rich and powdery tannins and underpinned by lively acids. This is a muscular young Clos Vougeot that's long and resonant, but which is at least a decade away from its peak, even if it's sufficiently refined to be approached earlier.",2013 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 94
57,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2013 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is a beautiful young wine, offering up aromas of red plums, cassis, smoked duck, exotic spices and dried rose petals. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy but youthfully reserved, with fine-grained tannins, racy acids and a deep, tightly coiled core. While this is sufficiently structurally refined to be approachable now, the real fireworks will come with another decade of bottle age.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 94
58,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2011 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is a stunning young wine, unfurling in the decanter and glass to reveal aromas of lemon oil, candle wax, dried white flowers, woodsmoke and a classy framing of noble reduction. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with the chewy, chalky phenolic structure of a red wine, racy acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. This superb Corton-Charlemagne has not merely years  but decades ahead of it.",2011 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 94
59,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2011 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a tightly wound young wine, unfurling in the glass with scents of wild berries, smoked meats, exotic spices, orange rind and plums. Medium to full-bodied, deep and coiled, it's elegantly muscular, with huge reserves of concentration, lively acids and powdery tannins. Even if it's already very impressive today, this really needs a decade's patience.",2011 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
60,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2009 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières is beginning to drink beautifully, soaring from the glass with an inviting bouquet of rose petals, blackberries, smoked duck, incense and exotic spices. Full-bodied, velvety and spumous, it's layered and textural, underpinned by ripe, powdery tannins and succulent acids.",2009 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP 94
61,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Wafting from the glass with scents of raspberries, dark chocolate, rose petals, candied peel, incense and grilled squab, the 2008 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is full-bodied, satiny textured and vibrant, its beautifully ripe tannin and tangy acids framing a deep, concentrated core of fruit, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. Anyone who has the chance to taste this wine shouldn't hesitate.",2008 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 94
62,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru really blossomed in the decanter, shaking off a touch of reduction to reveal a stunning bouquet of citrus oil—lime, lemon—mingled with oyster shell, white flowers, green pear, nutmeg and wheat toast. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and tight-knit, with a rock-solid core, incisive acids and a long, searingly mineral finish. As usual, this is structured more like a red wine than a white. What's more, it's one of the white wines of the vintage in 2007.",2007 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 94
63,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"An elegant rendition of this site, the 2006 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu exhibits pretty aromas of rose petals, cherries and candied peel. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, silky and precise, with a structurally delicate, tender quality so typical of that vintage—but which only foregrounds the wine's beautiful purity of fruit.",2006 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 94
64,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Domaine Leroy's 2005 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a brillant young wine, though it's still the better part of a decade away from even early maturity. Unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of black cherries, wild berries, smoked meats, espresso roast, blood orange and exotic spices, framed by a deft touch of new oak, it's full-bodied, deep and layered, with an immensely concentrated core of fruit, elegantly muscular structuring tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, carnal finish.",2005 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 94
65,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Lalou Bize-Leroy's 2003 Richebourg Grand Cru is drinking exquisitely well, mingling aromas of plums and sweet red berries with notes of raw cocoa, exotic spices, candied peel, burning embers and subtle hints of smoked meats. Full-bodied, rich and expansive, it's a lavish, dramatic wine, defined by a deep and voluminous core of sumptuous fruit that's framed by velvety tannins and ripe but lively acids, concluding with a long and superbly integrated finish. This a striking, dramatic Richebourg that demonstrates the deftness with which Leroy realized all the potential of this extreme vintage.",2003 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 94
66,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"This was the best bottle that I've encountered of Leroy's 1999 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru, unfurling in the glass with a deep and complex bouquet of dark berry fruit, cassis, smoked meats, rose petals, candied peel and sweet spices. Full-bodied, velvety and immensely concentrated, it's seamless and multidimensional, built around an elegantly muscular chassis of velvety tannin and a lively spine of acidity, concluding with a sapid and expansive finish.",1999 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 94
67,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"One of the wines of the vintage is the 2017 Musigny Grand Cru, a stunning young wine that reveals a bouquet of immense incipient complexity, mingling notes of raspberries and red fruits with suggestions of blood orange, peonies and rose hips. On the palate, this young Musigny is full-bodied, pure and precise, with an enveloping attack, immense depth at the core and exquisite structural elegance. The finish is long, mineral and beautifully defined. This is the most dynamic of all these young reds from Domaine Leroy, and it will reward considerable patience.",2017 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 94
68,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is the least youthfully reductive young white I have ever tasted from Domaine Leroy. Opening in the glass with scents of crisp green pear, lemon oil, white flowers, toasted sesame and struck match, it's full-bodied, multidimensional and incisive, with huge reserves of chalky dry extract that are more reminiscent of a red wine than a white, concluding with a long and penetrating finish. ""This parcel ought to be planted to Pinot Noir,"" observes Madame Bize-Leroy, but I suspect that in such an eventuality the structure of the ensuing red cuvée wouldn't be all that different. Despite that structure and all the wine's energy and tension, this is a comparatively open, expressive vintage for the Domaine's Corton-Charlemagne.",2017 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 94
69,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The profound 2017 Chambertin Grand Cru wafts from the glass with a deep and carnal bouquet that mingles rich aromas of blackberries and cassis with notions of summer truffles, smoked meats, espresso roast and baking chocolate. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with the most mid-palate volume of any wine in the cellar—its flesh and texture largely concealing an impressively ample chassis of rich, powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid. This is a decidedly serious Chambertin that will likely gain ground on its 2016 and 2015 siblings with bottle age.",2017 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
70,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2017 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru reveals a beautiful bouquet of dark wild berries, exotic spices, wilted rose petals and forest floor, discreetly framed by a touch of new oak. It's full-bodied, deep and exquisitely silky, with a concentrated core and supple tannins that caress the palate before giving way to a long, penetrating and pungently perfumed finish. This is a quintessentially elegant, ethereal Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",2017 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 94
71,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2017 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is showing especially well this year, opening up in the glass with aromas of wild berries, coniferous forest floor, cassis and dark chocolate, framed by a deft application of classy new oak. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and incisive, with an intense core of fruit, beautifully refined structuring tannins and a long, mineral finish. Finer-boned and more reserved than the Clos de la Roche, this will be worth a special effort to seek out.",2017 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
72,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Madame Bize-Leroy describes the 2017 Richebourg Grand Cru as ""civilized"", which I interpret to mean that this inherently supple, elegant vintage has tamed some of the climat's tendency to muscular power—an analysis with which I concur. Unwinding in the glass with complex aromas of cassis, dark berries, black truffles, rich soil tones and hints of rose petal and peony, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, with impressive concentration and rich but refined structuring tannins. The finish is long, sapid and perfumed. While I'm often inclined to give the domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant the edge over the Richebourg, the latter's elegance this year makes it more than usually difficult to pick favorites.",2017 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 94
73,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"This cuvée is always one of the more powerful, muscular wines in the cellar, and the 2017 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is no exception. Exhibiting complex aromas of smoked meats, dark berries, rich soil tones, cassis, warm spices and black truffles, the wine is full-bodied, deep and structured, with considerable reserves of concentration and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long and mineral finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 94
74,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is also spectacular this year, soaring from the glass with a striking bouquet of raspberries, cherries, rose hips, peonies and cinnamon. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and velvety, its envelopingly textural attack segueing into a deep and concentrated core, concluding with a long, precise and elegantly chalky finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 94
75,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"One of the highlights of the portfolio this year is the 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts, a serious wine that unwinds in the glass with aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones, pencil lead and complex carnal nuances. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, concentrated and multidimensional, with formidable depth at the core, an ample chassis of fine structuring tannins and a long, resonant finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
76,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Notes of cassis, dark wild berries, sweet soil tones, black truffles and incense introduce the 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru, a full-bodied, multidimensional wine that's concentrated, deep and structured, retaining its habitual introverted profile even in this generally open-knit vintage. The finish is long and precise. This is a Clos Vougeot that will merit more than a decade's patience to realize all its potential.",2017 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 94
77,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots is one of the more brooding, powerful wines in the cellar this year, opening in the glass with notes of cassis, dark berries, smoked duck, spices and coniferous forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, layered and muscular, with powdery structuring tannins, lively acids and a long, carnal finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 94
78,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"Notes of cherries, cassis, smoked meats, rich soil tones and black truffles introduce the 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes, a textural and expansive wine that's medium to full-bodied wine, with an ample core of fruit, lively acids and a long, saline finish. Tasted after the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes, the more carnal Combottes represents a total change of register.",2017 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 94
79,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2017 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a terrific success, offering up aromas of orange rind, red berries, spices and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and concentrated, with supremely velvety tannins, an ample core of fruit and a beautifully defined finish. Charming and succulent, this is a comparatively open, immediate rendition of Leroy's Corton-Renardes.",2017 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 94
80,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Mingling deep fruit tones of raspberries and wild berries with exotic suggestions of Asian spices, rose hips and tea-smoked duck, Leroy's 2017 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with powdery tannins, succulent acids and a deep, layered mid-palate. This, too, has turned out very well, though this year I'm inclined to prefer the Beaux Monts.",2017 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 94
81,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2017 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons is showing especially well this year, bursting with notes of raspberries, cherries, woodsmoke, grilled squab and rose petals. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, with succulent acids, powdery tannins and an ample core of sapid fruit, concluding with a long and precise finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 94
82,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Bursting with scents of rose petals, raspberries, cassis, spices and sweet soil tones, the 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes once again lives up to its name this year, its rounded and enveloping attack segueing into a medium to full-bodied palate that's supple and layered, its fine structuring tannins entirely cloaked in succulent, sapid fruit.",2017 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 94
83,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2017 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is superb, and—as is often the case—I would argue that this is the finest of Domaine Leroy's communal bottlings this year. Opening in the glass with exquisite aromas of rose hips, raspberries, warm spices and sweet red fruits, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with racy acids and a long, mineral-driven finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 94
84,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Aromas of cassis and plums mingle with notions of pencil lead, woodsmoke and rich soil tones, introducing the 2017 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu, a medium to full-bodied, velvety and succulent wine, with good depth at the core and powdery structuring tannins, concluding with a long finish. This is a comparatively giving, expressive rendition of Santenots, a cuvée that can often be a little introverted in its youth—indeed, I sometimes think it as the Clos Vougeot of the Côte de Beaune chez Leroy—though it still possesses plenty of upside.",2017 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 94
85,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Exquisite aromas of wild berry fruit, smoked duck, exotic spices, peonies and loamy soil preface the 2017 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a medium to full-bodied, layered and concentrated wine with supple and powdery tannins, succulent balancing acids and a long, perfumed finish.",2017 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP 94
86,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Wafting from the glass with aromas of wild berry fruit, spices and sweet soil tones that are discretely framed by a deft touch of new oak, Leroy's 2017 Pommard Les Vignots is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with powdery tannins, lively acids and good concentration at the core, concluding with a long and delicately carnal finish. This high-altitude, south-facing site always produces an ethereal, precise wine that's worlds away from Pommard's stereotype.",2017 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 94
87,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Once again, Bize-Leroy opted to assemble the lieux-dits Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières into a single 2017 Nuits-Saint-Georges. The wine is showing well, opening up to reveal notes of cassis, grilled squab, rose hips and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, layered and attractively concentrated, energetic palate structured around fine and powdery tannins. The finish is long and sapid.",2017 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 94
88,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Chambertin Grand Cru is a monument for the ages. Wafting from the glass with aromas of dark berries, orange rind, grilled meats, licorice and peony, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and immensely concentrated, with huge volume and amplitude, deep and multi-dimensional at the core, yet all the while remaining precise, vibrant and ineffably complete. Both the inevitable power and the essential elegance of Chambertin are fully realized in this timeless bottle. Whether this or the 2015 rendition is superior will be the subject for a debate that could last the better part of a century, yet the 2016's obvious stylistic affinity is with the 2010 vintage.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
89,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"One of the high points of the vintage, the 2016 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru captivates the olfactory senses with its striking bouquet of rose petals, citrus rind, cassis, raspberries, dark chocolate and sweet Asian spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, utterly complete and multidimensional, with satiny structuring tannins, immense concentration without the weight and a long, electric and perfumed finish. This is a magisterial achievement and a benchmark against which other wines may be measured.",2016 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 94
90,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2016 Musigny Grand Cru is one of the more reticent wines in the cellar, reluctantly unfurling in the glass to reveal a profound bouquet of wild berries, rose petal, blood orange and ineffable savory nuances. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, incredibly deep and multidimensional, with extraordinary density without the weight and incredibly fine-grained tannins—but while this Musigny displays no structural asperity, so much is patently held in reserve that it's hard to read today. With bottle age, it's easy to imagine that this might end up being the finest of the Domaine Leroy's otherworldly 2016s, but over a decade's patience will be required.",2016 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 94
91,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The extraordinary 2016 Richebourg Grand Cru soars from the glass with an irresistible bouquet of sweet dark fruits, baking chocolate, rose petals and exotic spices. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and enveloping, with incredible depth and volume at the core. Velvety and textural on the attack, the wine's powdery tannins are cloaked in a gourmand core of fruit, yet the lavish, expansive finish is beautifully controlled and precise for all its drama. Only in a range as exalted as this could Leroy's 2016 Richebourg receive so parsimonious a score.",2016 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 94
92,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2016 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is brilliant, and one of the high points both of the portfolio and this great Côte de Nuits vintage. The wine unfurls in the glass with a captivating but youthfully reserved bouquet of rose petals, violets, blood orange, cherries and cassis, with only hints of the savory forest floor and spice to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and immensely concentrated, with an animating line of acidity that is classic Latricières, framed by exceptionally fine, powdery tannins, its finish long and unerringly precise.",2016 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 94
93,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2016 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is one of the most exciting wines in the portfolio this year, unfurling in the glass with a beautifully defined bouquet of pomegranate, rose petal, raspberries, red plums and sweet spices, with only hints at the savory nuances to come. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and searingly intense, with a deep, layered mid-palate that's both more multidimensional and more structured than the Chambolle Fremières—a feat that had scarcely seemed possible. The finish is long, fine-grained and intensely chalky. In this frost-ravaged vintage, Bize-Leroy has produced a wine that tastes like the distilled essence of Chambolle Charmes.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 94
94,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is just as stunning as the Brûlées, but more reserved and serious, unfurling in the glass with a less extravagant bouquet of cassis, plums, dark chocolate, grilled squab, subtle spices and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and layered, with striking amplitude and dimension, displaying a deep, searingly concentrated core that's framed by fine, powdery tannins. And if the Beaux Monts' finish isn't as expansive as the Brûlées', it's even longer and more penetrating. What's clear is that although the domaine's two Vosne premier crus touch, the wines themselves could hardly be more distinct.",2016 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
95,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru is striking, bursting from the glass with aromas of wild berries, grilled game, dark chocolate, cinnamon and violets. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, broad-shouldered and searingly concentrated, with a bottomless core of fruit, rich but supple structuring tannins, and a long, muscular finish. Above all, however, this wine is thrillingly vibrant, endowed with energy that evokes the 2010 rendition. It will need time, certainly, and it remains one of the more structural wines in the portfolio; but, if anything, it's less tight-knit than the 2015.",2016 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 94
96,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru offers up a rich, brooding bouquet of cassis, wild berries, dark chocolate, incense and pencil shavings that are still quite youthfully reserved. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and layered, with immense concentration at the core, a rich chassis of structuring tannins and a long, powerful finish. Beautifully complete, this Clos Vougeot is predictably backward and tight-knit, and I suspect it will require more patience than any other wine in the cellar this year.",2016 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 94
97,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2016 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées is a wine that speaks to the senses more than the intellect, soaring from the glass with aromas of ripe cassis, cherries and blackberries that mingle with lifted top-notes of rose petal and exotic spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and gourmand, cascading over the tongue with wave after wave of succulent, satiny fruit that entirely cloaks its satiny tannins, before concluding with a lavish, expansive but unerringly precise finish. I confess to a decided weakness for this Vosne-Romanée premier cru, a wine that's among the most viscerally thrilling in the Leroy portfolio.",2016 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 94
98,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Aromas of citrus oil, beeswax, smoky pear, toasted nuts and an exotic top-note of candied angelica introduce the 2016 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, a full-bodied, searingly concentrated wine that's structured around chewy dry extract more reminiscent of red wine, than white wine. Deep, concentrated and tight-knit, this is a stunning Corton-Charlemagne but it will require extended bottle age to attain its true plenitude of expression.",2016 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 94
99,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"More reserved than the Vignerondes, the 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots unfurls in the glass with a brooding bouquet of wild berries, rich soil tones, Asian spices, dark chocolate and grilled game. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and broad, with considerable reserves of concentration and extract, framed by a large-scaled chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the long, stony finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 94
100,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2000 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is a magical bottle that's just beginning to drink very well. Soaring from the glass with an extravagant bouquet of peonies, spices, orange rind, plums, raspberries and smoked tea, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a layered core, lively acids and a long, saline finish. This wine, re-released by the domaine this year, will show brilliantly for more than a decade to come.",2000 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
101,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 1999 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots shows extraordinarily well, unfurling in the glass with dramatic aromas of wild berries, cinnamon, exotic spices, orange rind and smoked duck. Full-bodied, multidimensional and muscular, it's hugely concentrated, its deep core of fruit framed by an abundance of powdery tannin and racy balancing acids. Long and penetrating, this is a memorable bottle.",1999 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 94
102,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 1990 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts is deeper, firmer and more muscular than the 2000 that I drank alongside it, but nor could it match its younger sibling for aromatic range, finesse or charm. For the better part of an hour, it showed brilliantly, delivering complex aromas of spices, wild berries, orange rind, plums, smoked meats and creamy oak, but later in the evening, the rather roasted quality that often distinguishes the 1990 red Burgundy vintage became more and more prominent. It's a medium to full-bodied, nicely balanced wine with fine, chalky structuring tannins and tangy acids, but in the final analysis, it couldn't equal the performance of the 2000.",1990 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 94
103,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"Soaring from the glass with exquisite aromas of rose petals, violets, cassis, raspberries and exotic nuances of clove and cinnamon, Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières is full-bodied, velvety and mutlitmiensional, with incredible energy and concentration, concluding with a long and resonant finish. This is a brilliant wine that entirely confirms the fine impression it made when I last tasted it in spring 2018.",2015 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 94
104,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"Aromas of rich berry fruit, grilled game bird, spices and rose petals introduce Leroy's 2015 Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières, a full-bodied, broad and enveloping wine with a rich core of fruit, ripe acids and powdery tannins.  Deep and concentrated, this Vosne-Romanée is more overtly sun-kissed than the Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières drunk several weeks later, yet the balance is impeccable for the long haul.",2015 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP 94
105,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"Aromas of dark berries, cassis, rich soil tones and grilled meats introduce the 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges, a deep and full-bodied wine that's envelopingly textural, its generous core of ripe, expressive fruit largely concealing the wine's powdery structuring tannins. Sapid and earthy, this is classic Nuits that is still not really ready for prime-time drinking.",2015 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 94
106,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2013 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is still quite tight-knit and reserved, opening in the glass with aromas of cassis and wild plums, mingled with notions of smoked meats, incense, rich soil tones and peonies. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and textural, built around an ample chassis of rich and powdery tannins and underpinned by lively acids. This is a muscular young Clos Vougeot that's long and resonant, but which is at least a decade away from its peak, even if it's sufficiently refined to be approached earlier.",2016 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP 95
107,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2016 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes offers up aromas of wild berries, spices, dried flowers and sweet soil tones, followed by a medium to full-bodied, satiny and multidimensional palate, its delicately chalky tannins cloaked in a fleshy core of fruit that lives up to the climat's name, concluding with a long and perfumed finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 95
108,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"Aromas of spicy wild berries, grilled meat and forest floor introduce the superb 2016 Pommard Les Vignots, a medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated wine with a deep, tight-knit core, powerful structuring tannins and a lovely line of animating acidity. More reserved than the gourmand 2015 rendition, this will be less approachable out of the gates and is more obviously defined by its high-altitude site.",2016 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 95
109,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2010 Chambertin Grand Cru is spectacular, bursting from the glass with a youthful bouquet of rich red and black fruits, burning embers, rose petal and licorice, subtly framed by a discreet application of new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with satiny tannins, a concentrated core of fruit and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Of all Leroy's 2010s, this demands the most additional cellaring, and I suspect it will also prove to be the longest lived. This monumental wine is a reminder that Chambertin is not the greatest of the commune's grands crus by virtue of its power but rather thanks to its ineffable completeness and elegance.",2010 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
110,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2010 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru is spectacular, unfurling in the glass with a deep bouquet of wild red berries, potpourri, smoked duck and exotic spices. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and multidimensional, with utterly suave structuring tannins and a superb line of acidity that lends the wine immense length and focus—in contrast to the broader, more expansive and gourmand Richebourg served alongside it. This is a real highlight of the 2010 portfolio and I suspect it is holding a great deal in reserve to be revealed over the coming decade and beyond.",2010 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
111,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"Notes of lemon oil, nutmeg and sesame mingle with lime zest and white truffle in a complex mélange, introducing the 2010 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firmly structured, with immense concentration, tension and substance. Like the whites from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it, this Corton-Charlemagne exhibits a phenolic frame that wouldn't be out of place in a red wine, and it requires the best part of another decade of cellaring.",2010 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
112,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Notes of smoked duck, rich black fruits and Asian spices introduce the 2010 Richebourg Grand Cru, an ample, full-bodied wine with a gourmand core of fruit that largely conceals its satiny tannins, underpinned by tangy balancing acids. The finish is long and sapid. The Richebourg is more dramatic and expansive than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, but it isn't quite as focused and elegant.",2010 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
113,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2010 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is already comparatively expressive today, wafting from the glass with aromas of red berries, cassis, incense and musk, with bass notes of sweet grilled meat emerging with time in the glass. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and bright, built around a beautiful line of racy acidity and framed by fine-grained, delicately chalky tannins. It's very intense and long.",2010 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
114,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 1999 Richebourg Grand Cru is very special, bursting from the glass with a lavish bouquet of raw cocoa, Asian spices, ripe plums, rose petal and potpourri. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and perfumed, with a gourmand, layered mid-palate, melting tannins and a long, beautifully delineated finish. In recent vintages, I've tended to prefer the Domaine's Romanée-Saint-Vivant to its Richebourg, but in 1999 it's the latter that has the edge.",1999 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
115,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 1999 Chambertin Grand Cru is a rich, dramatic wine, bursting with aromas of sweet cassis, rich soil, cedary new oak and incense. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and textural, with a firm chassis of structuring tannins and a long, stony finish. This Chambertin isn't as seamless or weightlessly intense as more recent vintages from Domaine Leroy, but it's a very exciting wine.",1999 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
116,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"A rich, dramatic wine, the 1999 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru bursts with aromas of caramelized citrus, pear, verbena flowers and honeycomb. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and powerful, with chewy extract and structure, displaying immense concentration and stony depth. It's still shockingly youthful, so I may be underestimating it, but I didn't find it quite as complete or profound as the two 1999s from Domaine d'Auvenay that accompanied it.",1999 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
117,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 1999 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru was the one wine in the range that seemed a little fatigued, offering up aromas of dried red berries, candied peel, sweet spices and camphor, with a light framing of new oak still in evidence. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, firm and chalky, without the multidimensional completeness and seamless integration that the domaine so routinely attains.",1999 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
118,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2015 Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is one of the most magical wines to be found in Burgundy in this vintage, soaring from the glass with a bouquet of kaleidoscopic complexity, featuring notes of rose petal, blood orange, potpourri and bright berry fruit, with only hints of the savory complexity to come with bottle age. On the palate, the wine is deep, full-bodied and extraordinarily multifaceted, with immense concentration, incredible energy and a long, resonating finish. Both more elegant and more reserved than the gloriously dramatic Richebourg that followed it, this is a profound Romanée-Saint-Vivant.",2015 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
119,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Chambertin Grand Cru soars from the glass with a profound bouquet of cassis, cherry, raspberry, rose hip, grilled meat, spice and cedar. On the palate, the full extent of this wine's stunning amplitude and depth—and the reserves of energy that lie behind them—defy description. That a wine of such scale and concentration should be so seamless and complete is hard to fathom. The ecstatic commentary scribbled in my notebook concludes with the phrase ""essence of wine.""",2015 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
120,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The utterly profound 2015 Musigny Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy, the crowning achievement to an extraordinary portfolio and a wine that brought tears to my eyes, wafts from the glass with a deep bouquet of black raspberry, cherry, rose petal and spice. On the palate, the wine is bottomless and multidimensional, with satiny tannins and fruit of crystalline purity, so utterly harmonious and structurally complete as to border on the ineffable—and certainly to exhaust any tired superlatives. The finish is incredibly penetrating and persistent.",2015 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 95
121,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2015 Richebourg Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is an extraordinary wine that captures all the lavishness and power of this great grand cru, soaring from the glass with a deep bouquet of ripe black fruits, exotic spice, licorice and smoked duck. On the palate, the wine is huge and multidimensional, with extraordinary concentration and mid-palate depth, vibrant and full of energy despite its imposing scale. Such is the intensity of its finish that neither swallowing nor expectoration have any immediate impact: it's as if the wine's still there. While this will never have the complexity or elegance of the Romanée-Saint-Vivant, it represents the essence of Richebourg.",2015 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
122,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2015 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is one of the highlights in Domaine Leroy's formidable portfolio, soaring from the glass with an extroverted but almost ineffably complex bouquet of ripe blackberry, peony, game bird and wood smoke. On the palate, the wine is extraordinarily velvety and grand, with a lavish attack, a layered and multidimensional mid-palate and a long, saline finish—scintillatingly energetic despite the ripe, dramatic profile so typical of this climat. If there were ever any doubts about whether Aux Brûlées is one of Vosne-Romanée's finest premier crus, this bottle will dispel them. For now, the wine hasn't shut down, and I expect it to offer a very broad drinking window.",2015 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP 95
123,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2015 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is spectacular, wafting from the glass with notes of rose petal, black cherry, cassis, rich spices and dark chocolate. On the palate, the wine is silky, elegant and multidimensional—a world away from the assertive structure of its near-neighbor Clos de la Roche—with silky tannins, superb concentration and a vibrant, saline finish. For all its intensity of flavor, this Latricières is a delicate, transparent wine that fully realizes this grand cru's potential.",2015 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
124,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"The Domaine Leroy 2015 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru is a wine for the ages, opening in the glass with a classic bouquet of incense, smoky black fruits, red cherry and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and firm at the core, with an ample chassis of fine-grained tannins, excellent concentration and a firm, structural finish. Of all the Domaine Leroy 2015s, this—along with the Clos de la Roche—will demand the most extended cellaring.",2015 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,RP 95
125,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Like the Clos de Vougeot, the 2015 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy is built for the ages, opening in the glass with a bouquet of red-black berries, cherries, wood smoke, pencil shavings and incipient suggestions of soil. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and firm, with an ample and assertive chassis of chalky tannins, formidable power and concentration, with a long, grippy finish. This is cut from very different cloth than the Musigny that preceded it in our tasting, but it is taut rather than hard: the only missing ingredient is time.",2015 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP 95
126,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is spellbindingly wonderful, wafting from the glass with notes of cherry, raspberry, red plum, peony, lapsang tea and sweet spice. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, multidimensional and effortlessly complete, with incredible perfume, superb concentration and incredible length on the saline, penetrating finish. Of all Leroy's premier crus, this wine is the hardest to describe, since it's defined above all by its grace and harmony.",2015 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 95
127,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots from Lalou Bize-Leroy is an extraordinary rendition of this great vineyard, opening in the glass with a deep bouquet of sweet spices, dark fruit—plum, cherry—and rose petal that's both more exotic and less savory than this year's Vignerondes. On the palate, the wine is immensely concentrated, with grand cru depth and dimension, its authoritative chassis of fine-grained tannin only asserting itself on the firm, saline finish. In contrast to the giving Vignerondes, this Boudots is decidedly more brooding and structurally reserved, and it will need a decade in the cellar and benefit from longer.",2015 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP 95
128,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2015 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes offers up a deep-pitched bouquet of wild berries, spice, orange peel and grilled meat. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and multidimensional, with a fine-grained chassis of tannin that's more assertive than the structuring elements of the Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes or the Vosne Aux Brulées and which nods to the authority of Clos de la Roche in its profile. The finish is long, ripe and sapid.",2015 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 95
129,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy offers up a pretty nose of red cherry, raspberry, lapsang tea and rose hip, with none of the more feral aromas that sometimes seem to earn this climat its soubriquet. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, ample and concentrated, built around a chalky chassis of tannin and a bright, vertical line of acidity. This will need some time in the cellar, but it should emerge as a beautifully elegant example of Corton.",2015 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
130,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2015 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy opens in the glass with a bright bouquet of apple, lemon oil, wheat toast and smoke, framed by light reduction. On the palate, the wine is incredibly concentrated and intense, with a formidable structure and chalky extract that would be more familiar in a red wine and has a long, intense, almost searing finish. This was cropped at a mere 15 hectoliters per hectare, but while Chardonnay at yields like this can become overbearing, this Corton-Charlemagne—even in this sunny vintage—avoids any excess of weight or any trace of corpulence. It's built for the long haul.",2015 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
131,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Domaine Leroy's 2015 Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons bursts from the glass with a deep bouquet of plums, red berries, grilled squab and forest floor. On the palate, the wine is broad and velvety, its tannins entirely hidden in a sapid core of fruit, its underpinning acids bright and vibrant and its finish long. This Savigny's structural finesse is as striking as its marriage of bright fruit with kaleidoscopic savory nuance.",2015 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP 95
132,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2015 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu from Domaine Leroy is one of the more brooding, reserved wines in the portfolio this year, opening in the glass with notes of plums, inky dark berries and pencil shavings. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, bottomlessly deep and powerful, with immense concentration and a velvety but firm chassis of tannin that asserts itself on the chalky, authoritative finish. This will take time to realize all its potential, but at maturity this score is likely to look conservative.",2015 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP 95
133,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2015 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes from Domaine Leroy is a wonderful wine, offering up an expressive bouquet of cassis, game bird, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is more structurally giving than the Boudots from further north along the slope, with silky tannins, a deep core of concentrated fruit and an incredibly long, saline finish. This was cropped at a mere 13.95 hectoliters per hectare, but—as with all the Domaine Leroy wines—that translates into intensity but never heaviness.",2015 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP 95
134,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2015 Pommard Les Vignots is fabulous, soaring from the glass with a complex bouquet of peony, sweet plum, spice and rich soil. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with a deep core of crunchy fruit, racy acids and a wonderful sense of completeness. In Leroy's hands, this cool lieu-dit high on the slope above the village of Pommard has really excelled in this vintage.",2015 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP 95
135,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges,"The 2008 Nuits-Saint-Georges Villages from Domaine Leroy is beginning to drink very well, bursting from the glass with a complex bouquet of cinnamon, blood orange, peony, cassis, blackberry and raw cocoa. On the palate, the wine is sappy, expansive and medium-full, with an ample mid-palate, fine-grained tannins and a penetrating, saline finish—weightless but intense. In this vintage Bize-Leroy opted to combine the Nuits lieux-dits that she usually bottles separately: Aux Allots, Aux Bas de Combe and Lavières.",2008 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges,RP 95
136,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 1999 Nuits Saint-Georges Aux Allots from Leroy was still very powerful on the nose with ""thickset"" red berry fruit, a hint of blue fruit and a struck match scent that did not quite fit in. The palate is again powerful and dense, in my opinion my reflective of the 1999 growing season rather than the terroir, a village cru straining to flex its muscles and be treated as a premier cru. You admire that ambition, and yet it never quite achieves the nuance and complexity on the finish that would convince you of that. It is undeniably a delicious Aux Allots but one that did not trigger an intellectual or emotional response. Tasted January 2017.",1999 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP 95
137,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 1988 Romanée Saint-Vivant Grand Cru from Domaine Leroy was, of course, the debut vintage released under Lalou Bize-Leroy's name. Now at 28 years of age, it is probably beginning its descent from its peak in the 1990s although it continues to give drinking pleasure. Deep in color for the vintage, it offers pleasant cranberry, undergrowth, crushed violet petal and clove aromas that feel a little ""dimmed"" by the passing years. The palate is a little chunky compared to more recent vintages that I have tasted, quite tart in the mouth and conveying an almost Bordeaux-like structure on the finish that now feels a little short. Any bottles should be consumed in the near future because it is in gentle decline, albeit from a high peak. Tasted September 2016.",1988 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
138,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"It has been almost 15 years since I last tasted the 1989 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts. This was an impressive showing for a 27-year-old wine that comes from one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's earliest vintages of her domaine. It has a beautiful pixelated bouquet with strawberry preserve, sous-bois, morels and autumn leaves. This is sleek and sensual. The palate is medium-bodied with pitch-perfect acidity, still surprisingly youthful, long and quite plush in the mouth with plenty of vigour on the refined finish. It appears to be maturing at a glacial pace. This is a supremely well-crafted wine from what was a hit and miss Burgundy vintage. Tasted February 2016.",1989 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
139,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2002 Richebourg Grand Cru must surely be Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest wine of the vintage. It has more class than the 2002 Latricières-Chambertin--pure wild strawberry and black truffle on the nose that gathers momentum with each ticking hand of the clock as if to say: ""You want more?"" Of course you do. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin. There is great depth here as one expects from a Richebourg, not a powerful grand cru because this vintage was all about the nuance and delicacy, but it fans out wondrously on the finish with crushed strawberry and hints of cured meats. Very long, very elegant, very Leroy. This is an absolute treat. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
140,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2002 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts displayed a tensile, energetic bouquet that appeared to possess more focus than a 1989 Beaux Monts from Lalou that I had tasted a few days earlier. The aromatics are heavenly--mulberry, maraschino cherry, tobacco and a hint of seaweed, all beautifully defined and still surprisingly youthful. The palate is sensual, refined and backward. There is real vibrancy to this Beaux Monts, notes of raspberry coulis, red cherries and a touch of cola. It gently fans out on the finish, caressing in texture, refined and pure. I wonder whether this will actually improve with further bottle age? I suspect it has reached its plateau, but will continue giving drinking pleasure for many years.",2002 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
141,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2002 Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru is a very fine contribution to the vintage courtesy of Lalou Bize-Leroy. It has a tensile bouquet with edgy black cherry, dark chocolate and undergrowth notes, holding something back at first but then getting into its stride with a few minutes in bottle. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly brittle tannin (something that I occasionally find in this grand cru.) Yes, it is a touch foursquare, ""correct"" compared the more sensual 2002 Vosne Beaux Monts, but the energy and focus win you over. Drink now, but don't be afraid to cellar this for another 15 to 20 years. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
142,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2002 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes has a lucid color. The nose sprints from the blocks with lively bing cherry, mulberry and black truffle scents, perhaps a little more loose-knit than I expected yet still exuding charm. The palate is very well balanced, quite evolved compared to Lalou Bize-Leroy's other 2002s with a gravel-tinged, slightly ferrous nose . While it does not possess the complexity of its peers, this is simply a delicious, warm-hearted Chambolle-Musigny to drink now and over the next 5-10 years. Tasted January 2016.",2002 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP 95
143,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 1997 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru from Leroy is a decent white Burgundy, but its intrinsic quality did not size up to its reputation on this occasion. The nose is slightly reduced, but felt a little straightforward with citrus lemon and flinty aromas. It was just missing a little ""fatness"" you seek from this grand cru. The palate is balanced with a keen line of acidity, though it never soars, remaining a little broody and sultry. It opens with time in the glass, but I noticed a touch of warmth on the back of the throat and so I would drink this in the near future. Tasted January 2016.",1997 Domaine Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,RP 95
144,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2014 Richebourg Grand Cru is more backward than the Romanée-Saint-Vivant at the moment (the opposite to Hudelot-Noëllat the previous day when it was the other way round). Here, there is a very subtle marine/seaweed influence that tinctures that dark berry fruit. The palate is defined by its very fine tannin, the focus and tension interwoven through every atom of this Richebourg; the finish is surfeit with nervosité and tension so that is slips down the throat (guilty!) with so much ease. Wonderful -- one of the wines of the vintage.",2014 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP 95
145,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2014 Romanée St Vivant Grand Cru has a pure bouquet as you would expect, an equal mixture of red and black fruit, but infused with cold stone, wet limestone scents. This is beautifully focused. The palate is very well balanced with superb density, almost Richebourg-like in style, here veering towards dark red fruit -- cranberry, wild strawberry and a touch of brown spice towards the supremely focused and long finish. Sophisticated and precise, this is a Romanée-Saint-Vivant that will rivet you to your seat.",2014 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP 95
146,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Unlike last year, there are three barrels of the 2014 Musigny Grand Cru this year instead of two, not that it is going to make it any easier to find and somehow, I'm not expecting a massive reduction in price. It has a very complex bouquet with dark red fruit, limestone, a hint of hickory and wild hedgerow, quite mercurial in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, silkier than the Clos de Vougeot, harmonious with a killer thread of spice that bursts out towards the finish. Very complex and sophisticated, this Musigny deserves several years in bottle before even thinking about it.",2014 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP 95
147,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has just a faint reduction on the nose, but behind that lies very intense dark cherry, cranberry jus and mineral scents that seem to gain intensity with every swirl of the glass. The palate is stunning: filigree tannin, almost overwhelming intensity with great power and detail on the silky-smooth finish. This could turn out to be one of the domaine's finest 2014s given this showing, certainly one of Lalou Bize-Leroy's finest premier crus.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP 95
148,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2014 Gevrey Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a focused, slightly more introspective bouquet at the moment: dark red fruit, a little briary and cold stone scents. The palate is where it is all happening...filigree tannin, tensile and full of nervosité, unapologetically linear and focused, a Gevrey that demands to be taken seriously with an intense, slightly saline, wonderfully detailed finish that lingers long in the mouth. Superb.",2014 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP 95
149,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Chambertin Grand Cru has a backward nose, much more so than the Latricières at the moment, though one can tell that is very well defined and full of tension. The palate is structured right from the entry, arching tannins here, beautifully focused with perfect acidity, gently flowing towards a very poised and tender finish that has so much tension. This is a regal Chambertin.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP 95
150,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2016 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is a particular success, unwinding with a captivating bouquet of rose petal, raspberries, orange rind and rich spices that are beautifully defined and multifaceted. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and fleshy, with satiny tannins that lend it a more than usually seductive aspect, though still underpinned by the bright line of acidity that always lend this wine is structure, concluding with a long and pure finish.",2016 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP 95
151,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2016 Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu is deep and brooding, unwinding in the glass with notes of wild blueberries, pencil lead, burning embers, cassis and grilled meat. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with a broad-shouldered and firm but fine-grained chassis of structuring tannin fleshed out with deep reserves of fruit and savory nuance. The finish is long and sapid. As usual, this is one of the less immediate wines in the range and will need some time.",2016 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (93-95)
152,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes was showing just a little reduction, but behind lies voluminous mulberry and blackcurrant fruit, here edging more towards the dark side of the fruit spectrum. The palate is quite dense, full in the mouth with a gentle grip, some salinity towards the finish, although it is yet to discover is ""flow"" on the finish that at the moment just feels a little static. That will develop once it is in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP (93-95)
153,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny les Fremières 1er Cru has a conservative nose, one that does not want to come out to play at first, although it gradually unfurls in the glass. The palate is very smooth and silky, almost like a Vosne-Romanée, furnished with fine tannin and a keen acidic thread interwoven through what feels like a dense finish. It is linear at the moment, but it will fan out once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP (93-95)
154,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Renardes Grand Cru already has an intriguing bouquet that is forming in barrel, a little more open at the moment with dark berry fruit, a touch of Earl Grey and bay leaf. It is nicely defined, somehow effortless. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, nice and saline in the mouth, very harmonious and silky smooth, so much so that you might think this was Côtes de Nuits. Lovely.",2014 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
155,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Latricières Chambertin Grand Cru was more open and transparent than the other grand crus this year, with black fruit more than red, a touch of earthiness and a hint of wild mushroom. The palate is quite saline on the entry, typically rather foursquare and correct, the acidity extremely well judged with a controlled -- you could almost say -- conservative finish.",2014 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
156,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Aux Allots has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath lie some fine, clean and pure black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. There is plenty of energy and animation here, an almost sorbet-like freshness, slightly candied towards the bright and lucid finish. Among Lalou Bize-Leroy's village cru, this might actually be my pick.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP (93-95)
157,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is packed full of dark red berry fruit on the nose, just a hint of bay leaf and Earl Grey tea in the background. It is very precise. The palate is fresh and crisp, founded upon edgy tannin, very tensile and brooding especially on the finish that clams up a little, finished in tight-lipped and taciturn fashion.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP (93-95)
158,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Aux Genaivrières was a wine that was showing some reduction on the nose, but some rigorous exchange from glass to glass reveals some gorgeous, ebullient raspberry coulis and blueberry scents. The palate is structured and ""solid"" in the mouth, quite dense for a village cru, with plenty of substance on the mulberry and strawberry finish. Give it longer than necessary once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP (93-95)
159,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Vignerondes 1er Cru was a little reduced on the nose, but the palate is very promising with bright red cherry and strawberry fruit, as well as a keen line of acidity. This is a more feminine 2014 with a finessed, beautifully poised finish. Maybe earlier drinking than its peers, yet there is palpable energy here that should see it age for 10 or more years.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP (93-95)
160,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru had the unenviable task of following the spellbinding Richebourg and I feel that it does not quite deliver the same degree of complexity and profundity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, just a touch of meatiness on the more savory finish that is long and tender. Fine, if not quite at the level of Lalou's other grand crus this year.",2014 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot,RP (93-95)
161,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu has a perfumed and quite floral bouquet with pressed rose petal infusing the red berry fruit. It is tight at the moment and will need several years once in bottle. The palate is well balanced, some hardness on the mid-palate, masculine and rigid at the moment, and yet to develop the roundness of this vineyard. But clearly very focused and perhaps a Volnay for the long term.",2014 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (93-95)
162,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"When broaching the 2014 Savigny lès Beaune les Narbantons, Lalou quipped that it was her ""Petit Corton."" It has a complex nose of red berry fruit, dried orange peel and even a distant scent of fresh fig. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, plenty of freshness and vitality here, a little hardness toward the finish and a light spicy aftertaste. Very fine.",2014 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP (93-95)
163,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Lavieres has bright raspberry and cranberry fruit on the nose, more stoniness coming through compared to the Aux Allots. The palate is very refined, supple in the mouth, fleshing out nicely towards the finish with hints of brown spice and tart red cherries lining the appealing finish. Just lovely.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,RP (93-95)
164,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Au Bas de Combe, of which there are just two barrels this year, had a  reduced nose when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is lined with darker red fruit than the Lavières, nicely structured, perhaps more masculine, more rustic in style but with plenty of substance. Give it 2-3 years at least after bottling.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,RP (93-95)
165,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"The 2014 Pommard les Vignots has a very elegant bouquet, very pure and self-contained with bright red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin and acidity, red cherry and a touch of spice on the structured, slightly brittle finish. Very fine.",2014 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP (93-95)
166,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"Tasted blind in Hong Kong, the Romanée-Saint-Vivant 1996 from Domaine Leroy was actually a last minute substitute donated by a generous guest following a string of corked wines. It is an absolutely stunning wine that transfixed everyone before we knew its identity (and here, I must confess that I suggested it was Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.) It's actually better than that. It has a heavenly bouquet  of black cherries, cold limestone and wilted flower petals that you could just sit back and inhale all day. The palate is exquisitely balanced with filigree tannin, extremely pure and refined with astonishing tension and precision from start to finish. It's the vinous equivalent of watching ""Swan Lake.""",1996 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
167,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2013 Richebourg Grand Cru has a more floral bouquet compared to the Romanee Saint Vivant, at least at the moment. It is very complex: black fruit rather than red, with hints of wilted violet petals and damp moss aromas developing in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with enormous structure and dimension. It is extremely complex, to the point where I found it difficult to find the right words! It just has a sense of authority and an incredible length that gently grips the mouth and stays there for two minutes after this ineffable wine has departed. Magnificent.",2013 Domaine Leroy Richebourg Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
168,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"It seems banal to state that the 2013 Musigny Grand Cru has a very “Musigny” like nose, but that is to say it articulates the terroir extremely well on the nose with black plum and boysenberry fruit, minerals, hints of truffle just in the background. The palate is very refined and pure, lithe, with filigree tannins and persuasive blackberry and bilberry fruit toward the finish inflected with hints of juniper and thyme. This is a Musigny that forces you to pause and reflect.",2013 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
169,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2013 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru has a more expressive bouquet vis-a-vis when I tasted the 2012 last year. Here, one finds touches of maraschino cherries, wild strawberry and undergrowth all beautifully defined, vivacious and ebullient. The palate is supremely focused and symmetrical, the tannin lacy and the texture so silky you might well mistake it for, say, a Romanee Saint Vivant. This is one of the finest Latricieres-Chambertins that I have tasted from Leroy.",2013 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
170,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2013 Romanée-Saint-Vivant has enthralling transparency and clarity on the nose with perfumed black cherry, bilberry and cold stone scents, perhaps almost like Richebourg in style! The palate is medium-bodied with saturated, silky smooth tannins, luscious red cherry and pomegranate fruit with great purity on the long and tender finish. This is very tempting and sensual. Put a padlock and key on this for several years.",2013 Domaine Leroy Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
171,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"After the outstanding Latricieres-Chambertin ’13, the 2013 Chambertin appeared sultrier and introspective, difficult to read at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannin, perhaps more backbone than the Latricieres but at the same time, its seriousness is quite arresting after the flamboyance of its “sister” Grand Cru. It is a Chambertin that does not quite want to get to know you at this absurdly premature juncture and it will require 8-10 years in bottle.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
172,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2013 Clos de la Roche has an airy and transparent nose that prioritizes the mineral-nature of the vineyard over the fruit at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, lithe in the mouth rather than fleshy, with very good weight, linear, but very harmonious and tender. This is a more understated Clos de la Roche in 2013, nevertheless a beautiful wine that I suspect might drink earlier than the other Grand Crus and yet will last just as long. ",2013 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
173,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Beaux Monts has great clarity on the nose, here veering more toward red fruit than the les Brulées, with subtle wet limestone and granitic scents emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied, very “gourmand” in the mouth, the kind of wine you don’t know whether to drink or eat (not in terms of texture but the flavors). There is a lovely meaty note that surfaces on the long finish. Tres bon vin!",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP (93-95)
174,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2013 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru les Combottes has a very complex bouquet with scents of wet limestone and sea spray infusing the red and black fruit. This is almost pixilated. The palate is quite masculine and linear at the moment, very well defined, impressive structure and presence with a very persistent finish that stays in the mouth a minute after the wine has departed. Divine.",2013 Domaine Leroy Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,RP (93-95)
175,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru les Brulées has a very intense bouquet, a little more floral than I was anticipating, with wilted violets scents chaperoning the black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. The palate is linear and poised, with tensile tannin: strict at first, but that latent concentration fans out gloriously on the tender finish that belies the structure. Sublime.",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP (93-95)
176,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Hail damage means that there is only a single barrel of the 2013 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu possesses a very elegant wild strawberry and mineral-scented bouquet that is very well defined. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit, strawberry pastille and subtle cassis notes towards the suave finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (93-95)
177,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Au Bas de Combe veers toward more red fruit than black, compared to the NSG Les Lavieres. The palate is very poised and surfeit with minerality. I detected a little more brightness and verve compared to the Les Lavieres with a prickle of white pepper toward the composed finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Au Bas du Combe,RP (93-95)
178,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes seemed more closed, broodier on the nose, compared to the other 2013s from Lalou at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied, fleshy and tender in the mouth, the red fruit moving to black toward the finish furnished with white pepper, rosemary and spice. Quite a mercurial Chambolle, I would afford this at least five or six years in bottle.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP (93-95)
179,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"There is something slightly more ""confit"" on the nose of the 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Les Lavieres compared to the Aux Allot. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine minerality and precision, structured and aloof on the end but extremely well focused. Give this 2 or 3 years after bottling.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,RP (93-95)
180,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2013 Chambolle-Musigny les Fremieres has a pastille-like purity on the nose adorned with perfumed strawberry and Morello scents, hints of rose petal just behind. The palate is medium-bodied, quite masculine and reserved at first, tertiary/forest floor notes towards the elegant, “classic” Chambolle finish.",2013 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP (93-95)
181,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges les Vignerondes has a rounded and even at this early stage, generous bouquet with dark plum and mulberry scents, wild hedgerow and a touch of mushroom. The palate is soft on the entry, plenty of ""rondeur"" here with a sensual, caressing dark plum and wild strawberry finish that lingers long in the mouth. This will be very tempting in its youth.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP (93-95)
182,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2013 Vosne-Romanée les Genevrieres has a broody, introspective, sea spray-tinged bouquet that opens beautifully in the glass, but there is something saturnine here, aromatics indifferent to getting to know you. The palate is medium-bodied with a ""confit"" entry, gently grippy tannin structure and an effortless mineral-rich finish, if not quite the length of a top vintage.",2013 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP (93-95)
183,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2013 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru is more subdued on the nose compared to Lalou's other '13s, at least on the morning that I tasted it from barrel. It just feels a little conservative. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly angular tannins yet plenty of freshness with a likeable red cherry and cassis-tinged finish that feels silky in the mouth, albeit without the persistence of a great vintage.",2013 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
184,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"There are just two barrels of the 2013 Savigny-les-Beaunes les Narbantons this year, instead of the usual six. It has a very expressive bouquet with light rose petal and forest-floor notes infusing the red cherry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannins: crisp acidity and an enthralling brightness toward the finish. This is the kind of Savigny you would slug back with abandon (if you had not seen the producer’s name.)",2013 Domaine Leroy Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,RP (93-95)
185,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2013 Nuits Saint Georges Aux Allots has a taut, reserved and quite tertiary bouquet that takes time to unfold in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannins, a little savory in the mouth with a harmonious, spicy finish. This constitutes one of Lalou's more approachable earlier-drinking 2013s.",2013 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP (93-95)
186,Domaine Leroy,Pommard Les Vignots,"There was just a little hail damage that affected the 2013 Pommard les Vignots this year. It has a light blackcurrant and briary-scented bouquet that needs a little more vigor. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannins. It feels quite masculine in the mouth, perhaps more austere than the 2012 although the smudge of iodine is welcome.",2013 Domaine Leroy Pommard Les Vignots,RP (93-95)
187,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"No, not the cheapest wine on the planet, but probably worth it. This 1998 Vosne Romanee les Beaux-Monts has a fabulous bouquet with wonderful delineation, hints of bay leaf and rose-petals infusing the mulberry and wild strawberry fruit, developing a fabulous ferrous note with aeration. The palate is fresh and wonderfully poised, the acidity perfectly judged, utterly harmonious with a cashmere texture from start to finish. There is a slight hickory note developing and enhancing the finish that is amazingly detailed, concluding what must be one of the most divine 1998 Côte de Nuits wines at the moment.",1998 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,RP (93-95)
188,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the otherworldly 2012 Musigny Grand Cru this year. Despite just a hint of reduction, the intensity on this grand cru is palpable and it unfurls in the moments it has in the glass, revealing dark plum and truffle scents that infuse the black and red fruit. The palate is defies all expectations: perfect acidity, utterly refined tannins, silky texture, a sense of harmony and completeness that it seems to stop the world. To put it candidly, this is a contender for one of the greatest wines that I have ever tasted from barrel…and I have tasted quite a few. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

189,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2012 Richebourg Grand Cru was showing more reduction than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant at time of tasting and so I allowed longer for the wine just to try and shake off a little free sulfur. There is wonderful mineralite here – supreme delineation but it is tightly wound, more laconic than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant. The palate is symmetrical, refined and yet intense with life-affirming mineralite on the haunting finish. There is perhaps just a little more persistency than the Romanee-Saint-Vivant, a touch more masculinity also. Wonderful.

190,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The 2012 Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru has an entrancing, extraordinarily pure bouquet with raspberry preserve and wild strawberry intermingling with minerals, cold stone. The palate is so refined and effortless: filigree tannins, perfect acidity allied with a sense of effortlessness contrary to the effort that went into its creation. So silky and weightless on the cashmere finish, this is a wine that you will tell your children about if you are ever blessed to drink a bottle.

191,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"To be honest, the 2012 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru has an unenviable job following the transcendental Musigny, but it is still a gorgeous wine, offering incense and blackcurrants infused with minerals on the nose. The palate is structured with a slightly chalky texture, adorned with a lovely sour lemon note that counterbalanced with broody black fruit that builds in the mouth to a very focused, linear finish. Sheer class.

192,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Chambertin Grand Cru already boasts a sophisticated bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit, broody at first but opening with a few swirls of the glass. There are hints of maraschino cherry emerging, light touches of mulberry and pomegranate. The palate is medium-bodied with a sterner character than the Latricieres. This is an aristocratic Chambertin in the making, serious and obdurate, underpinned by firm tannins that support the intense, broody black fruit. It has wonderful persistency in the mouth, allied with freshness and race. As epic as Arcade Fire’s “Reflektor”!

It is adorned with a very intense bouquet with dark plum, wild strawberry and forest floor scents, the mineralite emerging with time. The palate has exquisite delineation – it seems to just glide across the mouth, with energetic sorbet-fresh red fruit laced with blood orange and spice, the finish offering hints of cumin and black pepper.

The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

194,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts demonstrated more reduction than the Aux Brulees at the time of tasting. The palate is very precise with fine tannins, feeling tensile in the mouth, with red pastilles and a touch of lemongrass on the precise, feminine finish.

195,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2012 Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Aux Brulees has stunning mineralite on the nose. You can feel the limestone percolating through the red berry fruit on the nose to devastating effect. Its filigree tannins define the palate and there is a lovely white pepper note lining the entry. It feels long and sensual in the mouth with an intense and yet elegant finish. Complete – but like so many there is a solitary barrel this year.

196,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"There are two pieces of the 2012 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru. It has a fragrant, floral bouquet that like so many of Lalou’s 2012s is exquisitely defined and intense, yet never over-powering. The palate is understated, nonchalant even, with perfect acidity and abundant sappy black fruit beautifully interwoven with the oak, segueing into quite a weighty, yet elegant finish.

197,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"There are three pieces of the 2012 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru this year, the solitary white wine from the domaine. It needed two or three minutes to shake off some sulfur. Underneath one can find intense phenolic aromas, pithy pear, nectarine and honeysuckle aromas that are just a little muffled at the moment. The palate is fresh and refined on the entry with apricot and white peach notes, hints of shaved ginger and a light, beautifully balanced finish that seems as fresh as a daisy. Lovely.

198,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots needed a little more coaxing than les Vignerondes, but unfurls to reveal dried petals scents suffusing the red and black fruit profile. The palate is cut from the same cloth as les Vignerondes, but displays a little more matiere and even more precision towards the piercing finish, decorated with hints of wild mushroom towards the long and tender aftertaste. Gorgeous.

199,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2012 Latricieres-Chambertin Grand Cru is more open on the nose compared to Lalou’s other grand crus with plenty of rich, generous blackberry and mulberry fruit with hints of wild mushroom just lurking underneath. The palate is lively and precise on the entry. The acidity is very keen here; lending nervosite and freshness, informing the tense citrus-fresh finish that is more like a Vosne-Romanee! This is entrancing and in my opinion it is better than the 2011.

200,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Boudots 1er Cru has an open, complex nose, here a melange of red and black fruit infused with cold stone, almost flinty scents that impart great focus into this premier cru. The palate is extremely focused, symmetrical, with superb salinity and tension on the finish that lingers for a long time in the mouth. Deep and serious, this is a quite enthralling Nuits-Saint-Georges.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,RP (93-95)
201,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2014 Clos de la Roche Grand Cru was showing a little more reduction than the other Grand Crus this year, the shopfront closed. The palate is more expressive with supple tannin, a touch of white pepper on the entry, very cohesive but linear for a Clos de la Roche that keeps a tight control on the finish. But the aftertaste is extraordinarily long, leaving the mouth tingling a minute after the wine has departed. One comes away with the impression that this is keeping something up its sleeve after bottling.",2014 Domaine Leroy Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
202,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny 1Er Cru les Charmes was showing just a little reduction, but behind lies voluminous mulberry and blackcurrant fruit, here edging more towards the dark side of the fruit spectrum. The palate is quite dense, full in the mouth with a gentle grip, some salinity towards the finish, although it is yet to discover is ""flow"" on the finish that at the moment just feels a little static. That will develop once it is in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,RP (93-95)
203,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2014 Chambolle Musigny les Fremières 1er Cru has a conservative nose, one that does not want to come out to play at first, although it gradually unfurls in the glass. The palate is very smooth and silky, almost like a Vosne-Romanée, furnished with fine tannin and a keen acidic thread interwoven through what feels like a dense finish. It is linear at the moment, but it will fan out once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,RP (93-95)
204,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The 2014 Corton Renardes Grand Cru already has an intriguing bouquet that is forming in barrel, a little more open at the moment with dark berry fruit, a touch of Earl Grey and bay leaf. It is nicely defined, somehow effortless. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannins, nice and saline in the mouth, very harmonious and silky smooth, so much so that you might think this was Côtes de Nuits. Lovely.",2014 Domaine Leroy Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
205,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2014 Latricières Chambertin Grand Cru was more open and transparent than the other grand crus this year, with black fruit more than red, a touch of earthiness and a hint of wild mushroom. The palate is quite saline on the entry, typically rather foursquare and correct, the acidity extremely well judged with a controlled -- you could almost say -- conservative finish.",2014 Domaine Leroy Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,RP (93-95)
206,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges Aux Allots has a slight reduction on the nose, but underneath lie some fine, clean and pure black cherry and wild strawberry fruit. There is plenty of energy and animation here, an almost sorbet-like freshness, slightly candied towards the bright and lucid finish. Among Lalou Bize-Leroy's village cru, this might actually be my pick.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP (93-95)
207,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brûlées is packed full of dark red berry fruit on the nose, just a hint of bay leaf and Earl Grey tea in the background. It is very precise. The palate is fresh and crisp, founded upon edgy tannin, very tensile and brooding especially on the finish that clams up a little, finished in tight-lipped and taciturn fashion.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,RP (93-95)
208,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,"The 2014 Vosne Romanée Aux Genaivrières was a wine that was showing some reduction on the nose, but some rigorous exchange from glass to glass reveals some gorgeous, ebullient raspberry coulis and blueberry scents. The palate is structured and ""solid"" in the mouth, quite dense for a village cru, with plenty of substance on the mulberry and strawberry finish. Give it longer than necessary once in bottle.",2014 Domaine Leroy Vosne-Romanée Aux Genaivrières,RP (93-95)
209,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2014 Nuits St Georges les Vignerondes 1er Cru was a little reduced on the nose, but the palate is very promising with bright red cherry and strawberry fruit, as well as a keen line of acidity. This is a more feminine 2014 with a finessed, beautifully poised finish. Maybe earlier drinking than its peers, yet there is palpable energy here that should see it age for 10 or more years.",2014 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,RP (93-95)
210,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot,"The 2014 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru had the unenviable task of following the spellbinding Richebourg and I feel that it does not quite deliver the same degree of complexity and profundity. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin, just a touch of meatiness on the more savory finish that is long and tender. Fine, if not quite at the level of Lalou's other grand crus this year.",2014 Domaine Leroy Clos de Vougeot,RP (93-95)
211,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"The 2014 Volnay 1er Cru Santenots du Milieu has a perfumed and quite floral bouquet with pressed rose petal infusing the red berry fruit. It is tight at the moment and will need several years once in bottle. The palate is well balanced, some hardness on the mid-palate, masculine and rigid at the moment, and yet to develop the roundness of this vineyard. But clearly very focused and perhaps a Volnay for the long term.",2014 Domaine Leroy Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,RP (94-96)
212,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The rara avis that is the 2011 Musigny Grand Cru has a haunting bouquet that, once again, deserves time to unfurl with blackberry, pomegranate, mineral, cedar and oyster shell notes that are exquisitely defined. The palate is underpinned by filigree tannins. It feels so lithe in the mouth, spicy right from the start that sets the mouth tingling and then a crescendo toward the dark plum and bergamot-tinged finish. This is very complex and simply seamless in the mouth. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

It gains intensity in just two or three minutes. The palate is vibrant and quite spicy, almost exotic in terms of richness on the entry, perhaps one of Lalou’s more extravagant 2011s with a scintillating, silky smooth finish that fans across the mouth with hints of raspberry and pomegranate. There is enormous length and intensity present here – a superb Pinot Noir brimming over with vivacity and charm. The parcel of vines within Les Beaux Monts is basically a continuation of Aux Brulees.

Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

215,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"The 2011 Richebourg Grand Cru is a cousin of the Romanee-Saint-Vivant on the nose, but a little more taciturn prior to revealing enthralling sea-spray scents with aeration, here interpolated by subtle pine needle scents, coniferous forest. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannins, a denser framework than the RSV with a powerful, almost burly finish, though perhaps the Romanee-Sain-Vivant has a little more finesse and tension. Still, a magnificent wine, though.

216,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Magnificent. The 2011 Corton-Renardes Grand Cru has a bewitching floral bouquet, perhaps not quite as complex as the Clos de la Roche but beautifully defined, perhaps haunting being the most appropriate word. The palate leans more toward a red fruit profile with succulent ripe tannins; gentle grip and a multi-layered, white pepper-tinged finish that revivifies the senses, leaving it tingling long after the wine has departed.

217,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges 1er Cru Aux Boudots is slightly deeper in color compared to the Aux Vignerondes while the bouquet is very different, more marine-influenced, slightly estuarine. The palate is medium-bodied with a heavenly satin-like entry. The acidity is perfectly pitched, this Nuits building in the mouth toward a complete, harmonious, almost Romanee-Saint-Vivant like finish that caresses the mouth and exudes wonderful mineralite. This transcends the vintage.

218,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"The 2011 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes is one of my favorite Premier Crus of the appellations (although Lalou rebuked by suggestion that it can occasionally be a Grand Cru quality!) It has an understated, refined, focused bouquet that builds with aeration: blackberry, a touch of bay leaf, minerals and a distant trace of Provencal herbs. The palate is medium-bodied with fleshy ripe tannins and a silky smooth texture; layers of black and red fruit suffused with minerals and just a touch of spice-box toward the long, intense finish. C’mon ... this would embarrass a few Grand Crus Lalou?but maybe from other growers.

The palate is the most structured, the tannins forming a fine chassis for the pure black cherry, dark plum and spicy fruit, a clever dash of white pepper sprinkled over the finish when nobody was looking. Superb.

The palate is structured on the entry: a little more masculine than her other crus with a tightly wound finish. A little more closed than say, Dominique Lafon’s 2011, encountered the previous day, and probably deserving two or three years in bottle.

223,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"The 2011 Nuits-St-Georges 1er Cru Aux Vignerondes has a pretty bouquet that is initially taciturn, opening with blackberry, cola, a touch of broom and wilted rose petals. The palate is rounded and lithe in the mouth, the oak a little more pronounced at the moment although that will be subsumed with the passing of time. There is a gradual build toward a complete, caressing black cherry and black olive finish, a spicy note on the aftertaste so that you do not forget it in a hurry. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee.

224,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"The 2011 Savigny-les-Beaune Les 1er Cru Narbantons is understated on the nose but offers subtle dried rose petal and wild heather scents with aeration, but remains laconic at the moment. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy, almost corpulent entry. It has very fine volume in the mouth, fanning out on the broad dark plum and mulberry infused finish. This is one of the most approachable of Lalou’s 2011s and can just be summed up in the word, delicious.

225,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremières,"The 2011 Chambolle-Musigny Les Fremieres unfurls in the glass: blackberry, raspberry leaf and touches of oyster shell. The palate is full in the mouth: a Chambolle with fine volume, just a touch of graininess with hints of cooked meat infused the red fruit profile that lends it a savory feel. There is lovely length here. The finish is understated, leaving just a touch of soy lingering at the back of the mouth.

226,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2011 Latricieees-Chambertin Grand Cru showed a little reduction on the nose, although rigorous swirling remedied that. It offers a broody bouquet with dark fruit: blackberry and Dorset plum, but it will offer more in the future. The palate is medium-bodied with an attractive chewy entry, a nice grip and a long succulent finish. This is a fine 2011 but for me, not quite at the ethereal level of Lalou Bize-Leroy’s other Grand Crus.

It comes across as a little conservative after the wonderful Nuits 2011s. The palate is silky smooth on the entry, very refined with supple, lithe tannins. There are plenty of pure dark cherry and raspberry preserve notes to enjoy with a sedate, comfy finish that has a lovely caressing texture.

Here, the nose is a little more reticent than the last bottle in early 2012, but it opens immediately to reveal that rich, almost honeyed aroma, though here I notice a slight kerosene-like tincture. The palate is medium-bodied, powerful and very well-balanced with that core of spicy, honeyed fruit and a touch of glycerin on the weight finish.

Lalou Bize-Leroy is always among the first growers to bottle, as she was once again in 2010. Therefore, I have chosen to present final, in-bottle reviews of the 2010 reds along with the Domaine Leroy and D’Auvenay 2010 whites. All of the wines came in at or near the top of my barrel scores. Thinking back to the day I tasted the 2010s from barrel in a very empty-looking cellar, I am reminded, that, as elsewhere, the already minuscule quantities of these wines was made even smaller by the mercilessly short crop in 2010. Readers who can find the wines should not hesitate. In this vintage, the Leroy wines are deeply marked by terroir. Although I don’t share all of her views, tasting with Lalou Bize-Leroy is always a fascinating experience, as everything she does is informed by the deepest and most total conviction imaginable. There is no more ardent exponent of the most fundamental of all Burgundian values – the concept of terroir – than Lalou Bize-Leroy.

235,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"The 2010 Vosne Romanee Aux Brulees is every bit as exciting from bottle as it was from barrel. Today the Brulees is much more open than it was a few months ago, but its potential is the same, which is to say, the wine is simply magnificent. In 2010, the Brulees is pure seduction. Rich, dense, yet light on its feet, the Brulees is marvelously complex, but in the end, it is the sheer texture of the wine that delights the intellectual and hedonistic senses most of all. The seductive, ethereal finish leaves a lasting impression. Tasted next to Beaux Monts, which this parcel is adjacent to, the Brulees is intensely floral and precise, with more of a dark red fruit profile. Readers in search of the 2010s from Leroy will want to put the Brulees at the top of their lists. What a great showing! Anticipated maturity: 2020-2040.

Sweet red berries, hard candy, flowers and mint make an initial appearance before the wine blossoms on the mid-palate as it shows off its dazzling textural richness and finesse. The Charmes is at once intense yet weightless. Simply put, this is a magnificent 2010 Burgundy from Lalou Bize-Leroy. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2040.

Savory herbs, licorice, tar, smoke and incense are some of the many notes that emerge from this huge, layered Burgundy. Elements of inner tension and raw power convey a visceral thrill that is hard to capture with words. This is a magnificent showing, not to mention a Burgundy that goes straight to the heart.

Firm yet silky tannins support dark fruit, violets and spices. Ideally, the 2010 needs a few years in bottle for the tannins to soften a touch. Layers of fruit build to the incisive, powerful finish. This is a striking expression of Gevrey and Combottes. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2040.

The Vignerondes is one of the wines that has grown the most since I last tasted it from barrel, about seven months ago. Seeing it again today, the Vignerondes is impeccably layered and refined from the very first taste. Dark red berries, smoke and licorice are all woven into the eternal, saline-infused, textured finish. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2030.

This is an especially dark, brooding Vignots that needs time in the glass to start opening up. Hints of tar, smoke and incense wrap around the deep, resonant finish. From barrel, the wine’s structural components were more dominant, but now that the wine is in bottle, the sheer depth of the fruit is much more evident. The Vignots is even more impressive from bottle than it was from barrel, and that is saying a lot. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.

Waves of sumptuous dark fruit saturate the palate in this decidedly ripe, flashy Burgundy. Today, the Santenots is a bit oaky, while the style is on the edge of being over the top, neither of which was evident from barrel. The 2010 will appeal most to readers who like big, dramatic Burgundies. It is the only 2010 here (and at D’Auvenay) that came in at the lower end of my barrel scores.

This is a knock out set of wines from Lalou Bize-Leroy. Cold weather during the flowering reduced her already minuscule yields even further. As in many domaines, the most dramatic proof of the low yields was in the skimpy number of barrels to be seen in the cellars. There are a number of totally transcendental wines in this lineup. As always the wines were made with 100% stems and aged in 100% new barrels. The 2010s are notable for so many reasons, most importantly of all, though, they provide a window to the essential qualities of many of Burgundy’s top sights as seen through the lens of one of the region’s most brilliant and inspired vigneronnes.

247,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The 2009 Chambertin is one of the wines of the vintage. It is also the least obvious of the 2009 grand crus. This isn’t an immediate wine, rather it is a Burgundy that challenges all of the senses with sublime understated personality. Time spent with the wine is immensely rewarding, as the Chambertin is constantly changing in the glass, challenging the taster to keep up with its sheer pedigree. This is all nuance and class. I also tasted the 2010 from barrel, and it was beyond profound. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039.  

This was my first opportunity to taste the 2009s from Domaine Leroy in bottle. Lalou Bize-Leroy was among the first, if not the first, to bottle her 2009s, so she naturally wanted to give the wines some time to recover before showing them. The wines are stunning. Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top? If that wine is representative of the year, Leroy fans will have another superb vintage to look forward to, although yields will be lower than the already minuscule production.

250,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The 2012 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes is more open and generous on the nose at this moment, with lascivious redcurrant, dark plum and mulberry scents that are beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, succulent tannins offset by a silver thread of acidity. This contains wonderful focus and precision with enthralling nervosite and focus on the shimmering finish. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

252,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Again, there is but one solitary piece of the 2012 Nuits Saint Georges 1er Cru Aux Vignerondes. It has a broody raspberry and wild strawberry-scented bouquet infused with touches of undergrowth and forest floor. The palate is where it is all happening at this prenatal stage: “killer” tannins, nigh on perfect acidity and a sense of purity that is already quite enthralling. It will need several years once in bottle, but this has enormous potential. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy’s domaine wines are not the easiest to procure, but given that in 2012 the average rendement was a paltry 9hl/ha then I am envisaging a few lively “discussions” on the touchy subject of allocations. Lalou, suffering the sniffles when I visited but as energetic as always, was ecstatic about her 2012s, regaling them for their mineralite and terroir expression. She started picking on 17 September, a little earlier than others, and told me that the malo-lactics were a little tardier than usual because of the fresh acidity levels. Certainly some of the samples demonstrated a lot of reduction, more than Lalou was care to admit, but peering through them, there really were some quite astonishing wines in her midst. I speculate that the better Lalou’s wines, the more excited her two dogs behave during the tasting, and our two hour degustation was interspersed by manic tail wagging, the occasion tussle and one growling stand-off at the precise moment I had her magisterial Musigny in my glass. The journey through the grand crus was exhilarating, each suffused with untrammeled energy and tension, more expressive of their terroirs than the 2011s that I tasted back in July. There is a part of me that wants to by cynical given the stratospheric prices demanded, as if to say to Lalou: “Prove it.” And that’s the thing – they go ahead and prove that these are some of the finest Pinot Noirs produced on Earth. Readers should not that Lalou invited me to taste her 2012s either from barrel or later in bottle, whichever I prefer but not both due to miniscule quantities that are often just a single barrel, a position I completely respect and support. I would have chose the latter if I was being selfish, but the former to offer some guidance and some juxtaposition with other vignerons. Also, I did not taste the wines from Domaine d’Auvenay simply because the quantities are so depleted in 2012.

259,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"The 2011 Romanee-St-Vivant Grand Cru is blessed with a quintessential, floral bouquet that has beguiling complexity. Just allowing it to open over two or three minutes reveals hidden facets: limestone cave, dried herbs, jasmine tea and bay leaf that are all exquisitely defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a fine grip on the entry. There is plenty of concentration here, but it is brilliantly channeled and the finish fans out gloriously on the spice-tinged, animated finish. This is a sensational wine. 

Since I started visiting chateaux and growers in 1997, I have been fortunate to have ticked off most of my personal Holy Grails, yet a handful remain. One was to visit Domaine Leroy and taste with Lalou Bize-Leroy, who I have only met briefly on two occasions in London. Given the responsibility of covering Burgundy, I avowed to tick that one off as soon as possible. So, on a sultry Thursday morning, I finally pulled into the pebbled courtyard of her winery in the village of Vosne with maybe just a single butterfly fluttering around inside. Lalou was stepping out of her 4x4, beloved dogs yapping around their mother and perhaps warning her of an intruder in their midst. They are not exactly cut out to be guard dogs – no offence intended. Lalou was exactly how I remembered – with her wiry frame, like a titanium alloyed twig. Her piercing hawk-like blue eyes and angular cheekbones would give Kate Moss a run for her money. She was attired like a fashionable thirty-something and exuded the vivacity of a twenty-something with a penchant for the occasional rock climb. After pleasantries we discussed her belief in biodynamism and the ways in which the cosmos affects Mother Nature down to the Earth’s core. We toured the rudimentary winery occupied by the black-painted wooden vats and then down below to a vaulted tasting room, bottles lying hither and thither of what must constitute every wine she has made since acquiring Charles Noellat’s holdings in 1988 to establish Domaine Leroy. She was courteous to the point of occasionally scolding herself for vocally enthusing about the wines, mindful of not disturbing my perspicuity. Did the wines stand up to their reputations and let us face it, stratospheric price? The answer is “Yes.” Here was a master-class in terroir: the wines made in almost identical fashion in the winery, so that what is perceived in bottle is the interplay between Mother Nature and vine (under the guiding hand of Rudolph Steiner philosophy). Of course, one must always remain objective, and I have been around the block enough times to simply relate precisely what I find within the radius of a wineglass. And in 2011, it was clear that the wines of Lalou Bize-Leroy seemed to deliver a sensational level of quality that would make most winemakers curl up and weep, asking: “How does she do it?” I had to inquire at the end of the tasting whether they were all matured entirely in new oak, so seamlessly was the wood embroidered into each cuvee. Tasting through the entire range of 23 wines, before zooming down to Domaine d’Auvenay, the high points were scintillating Nuits-St-Georges Village Crus that transcended all my expectations and the sheer consistency of the Grand Crus, perhaps with the exception of the 2011 Latricieres-Chambertin, which I have always found wanting in the past. The Romanee-St-Vivant could be the apotheosis of the vintage, certainly one of the finest that I have tasted from the domaine and even dared “out-finesse” the Richebourg. What amazed me was the otherworldly precision, as if you could pick out each aroma or flavor from the air. Only the Chambolle-Musigny Charmes appeared unruly when compared to its peers, a little too feisty on the nose for my liking. Otherwise, this is just magic in a glass.

260,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The 2009 Clos de la Roche sits on the razors’ edge of opulence. Here the profile gravitates towards the black end of the spectrum. Leather, licorice and sweet spices add complexity and dimension as the wine fills out its broad-shouldered frame. Elegance takes a back seat to sheer power and muscle here.

This is all silk and elegance, but also quite aristocratic in the way it isn’t ready to show all of its cards just yet.

With time in the glass hints of red cherries and flowers begin to emerge, yet this remains an implosive wine in need of considerable cellaring.

Lalou Bize-Leroy was among the first, if not the first, to bottle her 2009s, so she naturally wanted to give the wines some time to recover before showing them. The wines are stunning. Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top? If that wine is representative of the year, Leroy fans will have another superb vintage to look forward to, although yields will be lower than the already minuscule production.

268,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,"The 2009 Nuits St. Georges Aux Allots presents a softer, rounder style of Nuits. Crushed flowers, spices and sweet red berries sit on a core of silky tannins. This is an especially refined, textured Burgundy of immensely early appeal, even if it lacks the sheer excitement of the finest 2009s here. Still, readers looking for a good introduction to the vintage at Leroy might want to start here. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2019.

269,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"The classic scents of rose petal and licorice, allied to game, cassis, and dark cherry along with ethereal, penetrating distilled herbs and berries make for a heady aromatic display in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Chambertin, then exhibit themselves on a palate that combines richness and vivacity, textural allure with firm underlying structure, and above all density with uncanny levity. The incursion of salted red meat juices lends another layer of complexity while tugging relentlessly at your salivary glands, whereas fruit pit piquancy and chalky minerality in no way deflect the purity of this Chambertin’s inexorable fountain of fruit. This is one of those instances were a wine is so arresting it takes control of you. I felt enervated and afterward exhausted. For the few lucky enough to acquire three bottles of this, perhaps one per decade would be the proper measure. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates.

270,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"The remarkably maritime mingling of salt spray, alkali, kelp, iodine, and crustacean present in Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Romanee-St.-Vivant could, I think, only have come from this amazing site. Bright red raspberry and pungent ginger and black pepper, add to the invigorating and enticingly savory salinity on a buoyant palate at once subtly creamy and bright. Ocean meets forest as brooding, decadent notes of underbrush and other woodsy organic remains emerge; while musky narcissus and bitter-sweet gentian add enchanting inner-mouth perfume. All the while, there is a keenly kinetic interaction of all these elements. The finishing sense of shrimp and lobster shell reduction allied to persistently bright, downright refreshing red fruits is as uncanny as it is irresistibly coercive of the next sip. And if this wine doesn’t leave you salivating helplessly, I suspect you have glandular medical issues. My Leroy vintage tasting had reached a point where I was caught between the anticipation of those inevitably great wines that lay ahead, and a desire to simply cancel the rest of my work day and spend it sipping and contemplating this Romanee-St.-Vivant. But I still had inter alia eight Leroy grand crus to go – which signals something interesting. Madame Bize-Leroy served this ahead of all her grand crus save the Corton, perhaps because this is ultimately more delicate. It’s also less dark in color than its siblings. This should offer profound and dazzling complexity for 25 or 30 years provided you can uphold your end of the deal.

271,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"If I was expecting density and formidable tanninity from Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Clos Vougeot – and I guess that, relatively speaking, I was – it surprised me with its remarkable sense of buoyancy and transparency. The extract and the tannic underpinnings are there, but felt in the background – or like the ground you walk on and whose support you don’t think about. Through a deep pool of grenadine, cherry and red meat juices are glimpsed heliotrope and narcissus perfume; rose hip, black tea and licorice; salt and crushed stone. An invigoratingly tart kick of berry skin and rhubarb adds to the kinetic intensity of an exhilarating finish. In 25 years I suspect this will still have sap and energy in reserve. It is a Clos Vougeot like no other I can recall.

272,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, jasmine, peat, charred red meat, and fresh dark berries scent and saturate the firm but expansive palate of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Latricieres Chambertin. Much of the same “blood of the stones” sense of mineral saturation emerges here as on the corresponding 2007, but this wine’s dark family of flavors is allied to almost blazing brightness of fresh fruit acidity in a manner that – along with its underlying firmness – calls to mind 2005. What’s more, for all of this wine’s full-court-press of flavor, dark depth, and bedrock-firm structure, it reveals an uncanny sense of sheer levity that presages future elegance. My palate just can’t shake loose its array of flavors. I’m guessing that 25 years from now this great wine and its 2005 counterpart will still seem like remarkable twins separated at birth. (Please don’t imagine them in a ring together, though, duking it out to determine a winner.)

273,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"Hints of game and animal fur as well as musky perfume of peony and narcissus all contribute funk to the aromatic complexity of Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Vosne-Romanee Aux Brulees, whose sweet side is represented by ripe black fruits, garlanded in heliotrope and fading lily. A marine alliance of alkalinity and mouthwateringly salinity joins peat, chalk, black tea, and forest underbrush and detritus on a silken, strikingly buoyant palate that really takes one on a tour of the dark, decadent mansion of Vosne-Romanee. This finishes darkly, deeply, envelopingly – and yet, the vivacious impingement of fresh berries, piquancy of tea and fruit pit, and invigorating pungency of mineral salts offer quickening 2008 typicity as well as a striking sense of counterpoint. This fits the Burgundian saying about Pinot offering a glass of night before you go into your own long night, and I hope to meet this sinisterly profound Vosne once more before The Reaper calls me. This wine harbors 20-25 years of vigor. (About myself, I’m a little less sure.)

274,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2008 Musigny is firm in texture and initially relatively reticent in aroma. Roasted red meat richness and decadently game-like elements put me a bit in mind of what I had expected from the corresponding Vougeot, but a blooming profusion of musky floral perfume bespeaks Musigny. There is a subtle oiliness of texture coating the tannins here and a tiny-berry concentration of diverse red fruits is shadowed by their ethereal distilled counterparts as well as by Chartreuse-like high-toned herbal evocations. This Musigny’s sheer sappy concentration, formidable structure, and carnal depth preclude its being charming or seductive in the unforgettable manner of its 2007 predecessor. But that doesn’t mean the finish here isn’t spellbinding or that the wine won’t bewitch you. Here, I suspect, is another candidate for a quarter-century’s enthralling evolution.

275,Domaine Leroy,Savigny-lès-Beaune 1er Cru Les Narbantons,"Bize-Leroy’s 2008 Savigny-Les-Beaune Les Narbantons is one in a long line of amazing demonstrations that this site can deliver profound complexity and pleasure, but I doubt that there has been – and certainly I haven’t tasted – a more impressive instance, or indeed any more impressive young Savigny. Site-typical carnal elements in the nose are especially clean rather than gamy, and allied to suggestions of red fruit distillates, ocean spray, and forest floor. An infectiously mouthwatering savor of tiny red fruits (lingonberry, red currant, fraise du bois); red filet-mignon juices; rich beef marrow; mineral salts; leather; and brown spices floods and invigorates the texturally seamless, incipiently satiny palate in a show of palpable density and gripping persistence that somehow also leaves room for tenderness. Tea like smokiness and tannin that suffuse this Savigny similarly do not preclude a vintage-typical sense of vivacity. A vibratory, kaleidoscopic finish caps this thrilling effort that ought to be worth following for a quarter century.

276,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Wood smoke, smoked meat, game, and alkaline mineral notes pungently scent the Leroy 2008 Richebourg, then mingle with bright red fruits on a plate that shows stronger tannins – albeit fine-grained ones – than any other wine in the present collection. The invigorating, saliva-inducing salinity here mounts along with the fruit intensity on a trumpet-like finish. It’s easy at this address to become inured to complexity, but I think it’s fair to say that this Richebourg does not quite reach the level in that department of the very finest Leroy 2008s. Perhaps that will come. What is amazing for now is above all this wine’s clarion intensity and sheer palate persistence. It should be given at least 8-10 years in cellar with the confidence that it will thereafter perform brilliantly for at least an equal interval.

277,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"After the amazing performance of its 2007 predecessor, I was especially keen to see what the Leroy 2008 Clos De La Roche held in store, especially given the energetic proclivities of its vintage. Cedar, quarry dust, and aromas of clean raw red meat ally themselves with intensely ripe cherry and black raspberry, which acquire a liqueur-like richness on a palate whose texture is as seamless as is the uncanny welding of distilled and confitured fruits, chalk and subtly oaky elements it manages to achieve. Here’s an instance, though, where 2007 beats 2008 at its own high-energy game. Still, this hauntingly-long 2008 is remarkable in its way, and doubtless poised to reveal further complexity to accompany its amazing richness over the next two decades.

This manages to be palpably extract-rich yet buoyant, tannic yet polished and inextinguishably juicy. The long, lip-licking finish here seems entirely open and brightly illuminated, in contrast with the darkness, mystery, or seduction of this collection’s Vosne Brulees or Chambolle Charmes.

280,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"Dark cherry and cassis infused with juniper berry, chalk dust, and decomposing wood provocatively scent the Leroy 2008 Corton Renardes, the addition of cherry pit bitterness on its silken palate pulling it in an almost austere direction from which the essential primary fruit juiciness so typical for the best of this vintage pulls it back. Beneath the layer of satin one senses a fine-grained structure as formidable as are this wine’s sense of somehow tasteable chalky mother rock and the vino-electric power dammed up behind it. This is a model of rectitude and its finish of pure, unwavering penetration. It’s also more latent than actualized. To follow its evolution over the next 20 or more years would be thrilling.

Tart-edged, tiny red currant and black berry along with concentrated, saline smoked meat stock on the palate are the perfect foil for all of the wine’s spiciness, zest, as well as a dark piquancy of fruit pits and smokiness of black tea that take on increasing prominence en route to a staining and invigorating finish.

Neither the mysterious low tones and minerality nor the vivacity of the corresponding Brulees are present here, but there is an almost implosive, sap-like sense of tiny-berry concentration mingled with resin and meat stock reduction that you simply can’t get off of your palate.

A bright burst of vintage-typical fresh red raspberry and cherry juiciness emerges at mid-palate, where an uncanny balance of incipient creaminess and brightness is also suggested, but there is a very slight tendency toward dryness in an otherwise pungently-persistent and sweetly-ripe finish. Having a chance to taste these wines but once, I shall only voice as a suspicion that this is one Leroy Pinot liable to stray from the straight and narrow. 

Lalou Bize-Leroy reports average 2008 Pinot Noir yields of 13 hectoliters per hectare, almost absurdly tiny even by her singular standards. Malos were a bit later than usual but were finished by summer, and the wines bottled – as usual – in December. Yet – also as usual – if their development was thereby in any way stunted, you certainly won’t detect it in the bottle today! The best of these display a sense of transparency; levity; and – even when rich and head-spinningly complex – a sheer sense of refreshment and invigoration that I have seldom encountered in other great wines from these sister estates. (Please note that my account of the complete 2007 red collection at Leroy was published in issue #189.)

287,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Musigny presents in many respects a more profound and concentrated variation on her superb Chambolle Charmes of the vintage. Its tear-jerking brightness of cherry and raspberry fruit and their distilled essences, decadent florality, and saliva-inducing maritime depth are extraordinary. The carnality here is akin to foie gras and the umami-rich crustacean aspect akin to sea urchin roe and lobster shell reduction. Hints of blond tobacco, peat, iris, fruit pit, and a hit of caramel add further, bittersweet nuance to an already multidimensional experience. Richly and tenderly-fruited and –textured, yet vivacious and penetrating, this should continue to perform astonishingly over the next two decades if not beyond. 

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

288,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Licorice, rose petal, and dark cherry in the site-typical nose of Leroy’s 2007 Chambertin lead to a sumptuous, silken, sweetly-fruited palate that for all of its richness displays lift and elegance, and for all of its sucrosity harbors irresistible saline and carnal savor, rendering a saliva-inducing, tongue-titillating finish. As with the corresponding Clos Vougeot, it’s almost hopeless to try to dissect this further with flailing descriptors. Suffice it to say that yes, it is regal and suggests that a benign monarch might make for the best form of red Burgundy, a hypothesis that I suspect will withstand two decades or more of testing.

289,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"Kirsch, rose hip, and soy intensely scent the Leroy 2007 Clos De La Roche, which reveals brightness and finesse as well as a saline savor unusual for its appellation. To be sure, notes of leather and crushed stone as well as smoked and roasted meats contribute further and perhaps more site-typical complexity. But it’s the sheer finesse, buoyancy, and vibratory energy on display that most amaze, leaving your tongue and gums a quiver and your salivary glands pumping helplessly. There is also a faint hint of heat, but its effect is negligible given what’s going on around you when you swallow (or, in my case, spit). Look for 20 or more years of excitement.

290,Domaine Leroy,Romanée-Saint-Vivant Grand Cru,"A marine aura surrounds Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Romanee-St.-Vivant as it had this year’s Corton Renardes and several other of her wines, although in the present instance, that is more to be expected. Dark berries and dark, mossy, humus-rich forest floor; saline, crustacean-reduction, and oyster flesh mineral-animal savor; sweetly ripe raspberry, all follow from the nose across a sumptuously rich palate, and into a prodigious, saliva-inducing finish. A trace of warmth (rare in the present collection) doesn’t detract noticeably from what is an extraordinary performance. Follow it over the next 20 years.

291,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Clos Vougeot issues from three parcels at different elevations of the clos, and the belief (in which she is hardly alone) that such a range of parcels better expresses the essence of this cru is lent credibility in the glass. Ripe plum, cherry and their pits; roasted meats; salt and crushed stone are all prominent in a Pinot of formidable aromatic and gustatory intensity; abundant but refined tannin; and a reverberative finish that rings changes on your palate. The depth of rich meatiness; succulence of dark fruits; and formidable minerality are difficult to break down into further descriptive details, but taking a sip of this is like turning your palate and imagination over to auto-pilot, and if you cellar some, I suspect it will still be capable of holding you hostage and challenging the prowess of its 2005 counterpart two decades from now.

293,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2006 Latricieres Chambertin smells of peat, soy, game, and bloody meat juices, which figure on a palate of compressed intensity. Talk about “blood of the stones” – this seems to epitomize that phrase, although some of the iron-rich, corpuscular, animal variety is flowing through its veins as well. The presence of tart red berry concentrate seems almost incidental in the present context. A sort of sepulchral depth and stony fundament lend this severely palate-staining Pinot an aura of mystery. But it isn’t a charmer, and in its present state one imagines a vampire would find it more enticing than would a normal pinotphile. The sense of awed anticipation – of what this might become in 10-20 years – is its greatest attraction, in which respect, too, it is singular among 2007s.

294,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Its forward, succulent sweetness of red raspberry and purple plum fruit accompanied by blond tobacco and smoked meat set Leroy’s 2007 Richebourg apart from its Romanee-St.-Vivant sibling, whose utterly contrasting personality may convey more alluring mystery and complexity, but cannot compete with the sheer sappy concentration and particular energy and exuberance on display. There is a meaty savor, smoky tang, and brightness of berry fruit that truly stains the palate. I expect this is another Leroy wine that will defy its vintage by retaining stamina for two or more decades, and in the process will almost certainly reveal further facets.

Mace and ginger add to the enticements of which this wine already offers so many, and the finish leaves me invigorated and delightedly licking the salt from my lips.

This is one of those red Burgundies that prompts you to wonder how such flavors could come from grapes, but that at the same time seems uncannily at home mingling with saliva in human mouths. It also perfectly exemplifies the iron-first-in-velvet-glove metaphor with a chain mail-like sense of fine-grained resilience that in no way detracts from textural allure. Bize-Leroy compares this (like several in Savigny) under-rated site with Corton, and the analogy is especially apt in such an instance of grand cru aspirations fulfilled. I would anticipate at least the better part of two decades’ fascination.

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

300,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"The 2009 Musigny is graced with superb purity in its sublime fruit, articulate bouquet and stunning overall balance.

This was my first opportunity to taste the 2009s from Domaine Leroy in bottle. Lalou Bize-Leroy was among the first, if not the first, to bottle her 2009s, so she naturally wanted to give the wines some time to recover before showing them. The wines are stunning. Readers who have an opportunity to taste them should not hesitate. As always, the style is one of textural richness and depth, but the2009s appear to have excellent underlying material as well. The attention to every detail at the Domaine is quite evident in these thrilling wines. My visit ended with a sample of the 2010 Chambertin from barrel. Why not go straight to the top? If that wine is representative of the year, Leroy fans will have another superb vintage to look forward to, although yields will be lower than the already minuscule production.

306,Domaine Leroy,Volnay 1er Cru Les Santenots du Milieu,"Leading with a champignon-like note I would more have expected from Champans or other sites further north in this commune, Leroy’s 2007 Volnay Santenots du Milieu brims as well with red currant and cherry. Less refined in texture or refreshing (despite a tart fruit skin edge) than most Pinots in the present collection, it finishes with decisive chalkiness and persistent ripe fruit, but it isn’t clear to me that its faintly gum-numbing sense of tannic firmness will translate into longevity. Here’s one Leroy 2007 I would approach the same way as so many others of its vintage, namely to cellar for at most a few years, watchfully and recognizing that the wine might of course make a fool of me.

307,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Lavières,"Bize-Leroy’s 2007 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Lavieres marries bright cherry fruit with game, black tea, and leather both in the nose and on the palate, where its juicy primary fruit is laced with cherry pit bitterness as well as animal allusions. Smoky, faintly bitter black tea is emphasized along with leather in a finish satisfyingly persistent if not refined or polished. This might well become more focused and shed its slight rusticity with time in bottle. In any case, I foresee no problem with following it over at least the next 5-7 years.

308,Domaine Leroy,Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Combottes,"Boasting – if that is the right word – a tannic density unrivaled in its collection, Leroy’s 2007 Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes offers ripe yet tart cherry and blackberry tinged with Lapsang tea smokiness and underlain by roasted meats and chalk. The opaque sense of richness here is at odds with the norm among Leroy 2007s and is literally reflected in the glass by the wine’s turbidity. For now, the finishing fruit has to work hard to overcome gum- and lip-numbing tannin of a sort that I do not think is merely being temporarily accentuated and that I am not convinced – Leroy’s obvious belief to the contrary notwithstanding – conduces to long-term cellaring. That said, I would, of course, be delighted if she and this wine – neither of which I challenge lightly – made me look foolish a dozen years hence.

309,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"Initially a bit reduced, the Leroy 2006 Musigny responded to a shaking, blossoming into a wealth of floral perfumes, ripe fresh red fruits, citrus oils, and marine breeze. Strikingly vivacious and buoyant on the palate as well as silken in texture, this at the same time reveals a deeply meaty and stony undertone. The finish dynamically weaves its berry-intense, carnal, mineral, and floral strands into a long, colorful braid. And in the empty glass you realize that the spell of reduction is now completely broken and an eruption of floral perfume and of spirituous as well as fresh red fruit essences ensues. This is another great 2006 representative of its site in the making, as well as another demonstration of how beautifully suited the vintage is to expressing this site's virtues and vice-versa. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest. Despite their winsomeness, they have long life expectancies. Since, however, I have very little experience of their predecessors as they have matured, I have confined my prognostication to a few isolated and very general comments in the tasting notes that follow. Note that I have included as well under the heading ""Leroy"" the wines of Madame Bize-Leroy's Domaine d'Auvenay – its cellars located outside Saint-Romain – which now encompass two appellations in red, since inevitably when information is being sought about these wines, and even often when they are described, it is under the name ""Leroy.""

Suggestions of quince and honey along with lily perfume give the aromas an exotically, almost white wine dimension. On the palate this is liquid floral perfume and silk along with the essence of red fruits and hints of nut oils. But the dark, decadent suggestions of humus, peat, game, and otherwise ineffable mineral notes one anticipates from the best exemplars of the site are hauntingly present as well. This epitomizes the refinement and buoyancy of which its vintage is capable, finishing with cycloramic scope and symphonic length.

Tiny-berried concentration of red fruits; a tender, silken texture; and a sensation of lift and wafting delicacy put this in a category of its own, much as the 2005 rendition distinguished itself by being far and away the most refreshing and precisely-delineated in flavors of its collection. There is a shimmering interchange of fruit, flowers, and subtly saline mineral and carnal savor here that will keep you transfixed, your tongue trembling, and your salivary glands out of control. Here is a wine that epitomizes the classic conception of Chambolle as a wine of elegance and finesse, as well as epitomizing the potential of the 2006 vintage.

312,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Haunting rose petal, anise, and ripe cherry in the nose of Bize-Leroy's 2006 Chambertin signal a classic of its appellation, and the texturally-caressing, mouth-coating impression that follows tells you that this will be singularly 2006 in its tenderness and youthful approachability. Like the corresponding Latricieres, you have to look hard to find this Chambertin's abundance of fine tannin, as the flavors seem almost to hover over the palate, and its long finish practically dissolves into sheer inner-mouth perfume. The suggestions of carnal and mineral nuance here are extremely subtle – though almost sure to grow with time – and it is the wine's remarkably ethereal yet intense presence of sweetness and perfume that render it already unforgettable.

Ripe purple plum and quarry dust scent the nose. On the palate, the rich fruit here seems to oscillate in counterpoint with mineral nuances for a vibratory expression of vinous energy and complexity, and while the texture is velvet-like there is both a sense of primary juiciness and of lift that make for elegance, refreshment, and youthful accessibility one wouldn't ordinarily encounter in great Corton. The underlying structure is present for long aging, to be sure, but is almost undetectably woven into the wine's fabric. As this opened to the air, animal notes added to the intriguing mineral dimensions, and finish really took flight.

315,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Smoky pungency mingles with dark berry concentrates and bitter-sweet floral essences on the nose of the Leroy 2006 Richebourg. This Pinot strides magisterially onto the palate, with obvious firmness and depth of tannic tread, but at the same time a plush wealth of sweet black fruits that overrides the tannins and makes for a surprisingly soothing impression. Crushed stone and roasted meats add authority to a long finish in which rather obvious tannins returned. Somehow, the character of the vintage seems to suit the Romanee-St.-Vivant better than it does this Richebourg. But it's early days, especially for a wine of such sweetness of fruit, muscularity, and sheer extract as this. Furthermore, it's hard for me to discount the possibility that the unexpected and slightly awkward reappearance of tannins in the finish here might be a function of temporary perturbation or Burgundian Pinot moodiness. 

The results achieved by Lalou Bize-Leroy in 2006 are all the more notable in view of the misgivings she expressed early on about this vintage. (And, as her reaction to 2004 demonstrates, she will not shy away from declassifying even her entire production if she feels that the wines are not up to their terroir pedigrees.) As voluptuously rich as are Bize-Leroy's 2006 reds, they preserve the sense of buoyancy and elegance common to so many of the standouts of this vintage, and one's gums will not come away fatigued by the strength of underlying tannin or the near-hyper-concentration displayed by her – to be sure awesome – 2005s. As every year, these wines represent meticulous vine manicure; miniscule yields (""above all regulated by severe pruning, not triage,"" Bize-Leroy emphasizes); and fidelity to biodynamic methods and metaphysics; and were bottled in the second December following the harvest.

This is truly like liquid silk, yet refreshing at the same time; intensely fruited (seemingly supported by a couple of grams of residual sugar) yet with plenty of Chambolle-typical carnality and minerality. Those few wine lovers able to afford and acquire it ought not to delay in enjoying at least a portion of their treasure.

Smoky, saline, and pungently herbal notes mingle with the carnal and berry-rich elements in a long finish of mouth-watering savor and invigoratingly pungent smokiness.

Rich and velvety on the palate, this favors the soothing rather than invigorating or refreshing side of 2006, with a metaphorically dark, decadent complexity that puts me more in mind of Romanee St.-Vivant than it does of Richebourg, very near to which this wine grew. Fine tannins become more evident in the long, low-toned finish than they are on the mid-palate, but I could well imagine this maturing beautifully for 12-15 years without any awkward stretches.

This lingers last as sheer perfume.

The cherry-like fruit here is even sweeter, purer and has a slightly fresher edge than in the Brulees, but despite fascinating carnal and forest floor shadings, there is not quite the same mysterious complexity, at least for now.

328,Domaine Leroy,Musigny Grand Cru,"I had to draw a deep breath in anticipation of what would rise from my glass of Leroy 2005 Musigny, and in that moment Madame Leroy trenchantly observed that “it’s another world” down in there. Tea, ginger, tangerine rind, myriad sweet flowers, cherry distillate, truffles, and fraise des bois preserves are among the scents that pour forth. Bloody fresh meat and implacable chalk join the medley of fruit, floral and spice concentrates on a palate whose texture “polish,” “refinement,” or “velvet” are pitifully inadequate to describe. For all of its amazing richness, this displays more of a confident inner sweetness than a superficial sucrosity, and there is no lack of sheer energetic brightness of fruit and drive. Indeed, seatbelts would be advised before attempting to swallow this elixir, such is the phenomenal thrust of its finish.

Monumentally dense, yet vibrant and energetic, this builds momentum on the palate as it adds black pepper, tactile cinnamon spice, and distilled fruit and herb concentration. I have seldom experienced such a literal (not to mention phenomenally long) finish: it simply wiped the floor with your humble critic.

Chocolate-covered black cherries, plum preserves, and truffles are laced with creme de cassis and soy, underlain by a decidedly stony, chalky minerality and a fine but firm web of tannin. By now one realizes that 2005 is an exceptional vintage for this site in and of itself, but one would never confuse the D.R.C. or Potel renditions with this flamboyant, extravagantly-rich version from Leroy.

331,Domaine Leroy,Latricières-Chambertin Grand Cru,"A dizzying and seductive bouquet incorporating licorice, spice cake, cherry preserves, and humus announces the arrival of a 2005 Latricieres-Chambertin that takes the smooth, silken-creamy texture of so many of these Leroy 2005s to a new level. Interestingly, this is a bit less deep in color than the rest of today’s grand cru company, and is visibly unfiltered. Explosively intense yet clear as a bell in its finish of licorice and cherry, and with ferocious animal intensity and a veritable smelting of ore-like minerals (could these be Latriciere’s notorious iron asserting itself?), this marks the point at which true geeks will get out their stopwatches and start timing. It comes off as almost spare in the context of Leroy other 2005s, and it won’t be everyone’s cup of Pinot, but I would dearly love to revisit it in 8-10 years.

332,Domaine Leroy,Clos de la Roche Grand Cru,"The parcel that informs a 2005 Clos de la Roche touches Leroy’s Combottes. This wine smells of resin, tobacco, incense, roasted meats, wood smoke, wet stones, alongside stewed cherries and rhubarb. Roasted and stewy richness characterize the intimate meld of meat and fruit on the palate as well. For sheer density this is incredibly impressive, but it’s not at all lacking in the kinetic department, either. What is lacking is the perfume or pure clarity of fruit that the best of this collection display. Almost frighteningly gripping in the back (or on the way down, should you dare to swallow!) with an implosive display of meatiness and stony minerality, this will surely need years to reveal its full potential.

333,Domaine Leroy,Richebourg Grand Cru,"Their 2005 Richebourg leads with black raspberry liqueur, crystalized ginger, coconut, and candied violets. In the mouth, a meaty element, enhanced spiciness and a tart yet stewy rhubarb note emerge. To state that the overall impression is fat, full and creamy seems unnecessarily repetitive. But there is much more obvious tannin and new wood (even though it is the same 100%) in evidence than with the wines that proceeded it, and perhaps partly in consequence the formidably long finish is dominated by roasted meats with a sort of dry-rubbed spiciness, the suggestions of fruit more spiritous than fleshy. Still, the sheer intensity displayed is itself remarkable. This would be an amazing wine to revisit, but probably not inside a decade.

334,Domaine Leroy,Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Charmes,"The Leroy 2005 Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes smells enchantingly of bergamot, lily-of-the-valley, maraschino, framboise liqueur and crystallized ginger. Yet for all of this sweetness in the nose, the wine comes to the palate refreshingly free of superficial sucrosity. Cherry pit bitterness and bright, ripe fruit acids, plus scintillating inner-mouth florality contribute to an impression of great precision and “cut” (the last word I would have used in describing any of the preceding Leroy 2005s) and the taster is carried away on a wafting wealth of finishing fruit, flowers, spice, marrow and chalk essence-of-Chambolle. (The texture is silken and refined to a remarkable but, in the Leroy context, by now routine degree.)

335,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Renardes Grand Cru,"The Leroy 2005 Corton Renardes smells of red cherry, charred wood, vanilla, and lily, but comes onto the palate particularly juicy as well as satisfyingly rich and expansive. This is silky in texture but bright and insistent in its sense of primary fresh fruit. A superbly long finish unites cherry liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla, chalk dust, and a savory meatiness, and the empty glass is sweetly perfumed with sensational intensity. I have never tasted a youthful Corton remotely so forward, perfumed, silken, or superficially sweet.

336,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Boudots,"Leroy’s 2005 Nuits-St.-Georges Les Boudots smells of black cherry, beet root and black chocolate. Polished and suave on the palate, with pure, sweet black cherry and raspberry fruit in both liqueur-like and fresh forms (as with so many of the wines in this collection), it also displays deep meat and mushroom stock and a singed, caramelized edge to the fruit. This epitomizes the concept “layered,” but on the other hand, it leaves no nooks or crannies for warts or quirky complexities to inhabit because it’s seamless.

337,Domaine Leroy,Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,"Three micro-climatically diverse parcels – one of them rather recently replanted with a Leroy selection massale – inform the Leroy 2005 Clos Vougeot. Smoky, meaty aromas and a chalky density, smoky, salty meatiness along with black-fruited intensity on the palate are certainly in character for this appellation. This has girth and grip, a monumental structure and layering of meat, fruit, and mineral that lead one to anticipate formidable but glacial aging. There is not a lot of charm, no flattering high-toned perfume ... no, there is “just” a seamless meld of materials with massive yet superbly well-integrated tannic structure.

In the mouth, this exhibits real girth and grip, yet for all of the enveloping aspect of the fruit, there is plenty of bright freshness as well to carry into a finish with low-toned, up-welling of meat and minerals. This Nuits displays amazing richness, energy, and sheer intensity not to mention clarity of fruit.

339,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"All of the Leroy 2005s boast deep, dark color, but I should note that the 2005 Vosne Romanee Les Beaux Monts sets a new standard among them for noir saturation, as it does also for sheer aromatic intensity, albeit with a familiar cast, including black cherry, tobacco, and lilies. Voluminous and luminous in the mouth, this exhibits a continuation of the Leroy alliance of liqueur-like and fresh fruit aspects, amazingly precocious and beguiling creaminess of texture, and deep meatiness, buried truffles, and soy-like savor. It may miss the mystery of a few of its predecessors, but like Leroy’s Santenots, this Beaux Monts is compellingly sweet, rich, seamless and pure. There is a sultry sense about it, but no real heat in the finish.

But while the liqueur-like expression of fruit persists throughout, a fresh, juicy invigorating fruit character comes to its aid to prevent the wine’s becoming cloying. This Pinot displays in spades the proclivity of some of the best 2005s to combine the maximum concentration and richness of fruit compatible with refreshing juiciness and elegance. The amazingly pure, luscious finish – tinged with vanilla and nutmeg notes from the barrel – goes on and on. I suppose there could (and may well with time) be more complexity here, but the purity of fruit, uncanny balance and sheer length are enough to wow me.

Lovely dark berries, black truffles, moss, subtle muskiness and animality mark its very ‘05 and very noir palate, like an expansive, magic forest of flavors. The wine finishes with remarkable refinement and delicacy of plum and cherry fruit and a continuation of myriad mysterious fungal, scrub and animal shadings. Flatteringly creamy, it, however, shows a more tender and less obviously rich, sweet personality than most of Leroy’s wines.

A distinctively wet stone cast inflects the black fruits on the very full, rounded palate, and this wine’s long, strong finish is dominated by yet more sweet black fruit, plus red licorice, with only a low-toned growl of wild animal. And indeed, at least today, the personality of this wine is itself dominated by its concentrated, seamless finish.

Rich and creamy in the mouth, it nevertheless registers a brightness of fruit and invigorating cast as it spreads its charm to all corners of the palate. Porcine, smoky meatiness is never far from the surface, though, nor is a wet stone, chalky mineral cast that segues into the wine’s fine underlying tannins. A finish of sweet black currant fruit accompanied by bitter-sweet herbal notes offers exemplary transparency to floral nuances and underlying minerals. As with the Genaivrieres, there is plenty of delicious mystery here over which to scratch one’s head.

With that usually goes plenty of structure, and the present example will disappoint no one in this regard, as there are abundant albeit fine tannins to chew on. Almost inevitably though, from stem to stern, this has the trademark Leroy sweetness and richness of in this case black cherry, and the plushness covering the tannins. It finishes with formidable cling of sweet fruit, tobacco, roasted meats, and wet stones.

Uncannily meaty in the mouth with persistent sweet fruit and doughy, velvety richness, this displays a lovely sweet juiciness of pure, clear fruit and flattering floral perfume and creaminess of texture in its finish.

Full-bodied and intense, this awesomely deep, ample effort is concentrated, lush, harmonious, and stunningly long in the finish.

350,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Haunting aromas of violet, morellos, kirsch and sea spray mark Leroy’s 2007 Nuits-St.-Georges Aux Vignerondes, leading to a palate impression of refreshment and striking transparency to saline, chalky, crustacean, kelp-like, and meat stock elements. This is as tenderly-fruited, finesseful, buoyant, and downright refreshing a Pinot as I can imagine issuing from Nuits-St.-Georges, even if it lacks the sort of profound richness that more often characterizes the best wines from this domaine. I suspect it will remain well worth re-visiting for a dozen or more years, but (on the counterfactual assumption that I could both locate and afford some of this) I would not want to miss out on experiencing its youthful charms as well. 

The results Lalou Bize-Leroy achieved in 2006 – as I wrote in my previous red Burgundy report – were especially notable considering the misgivings she expressed early on about that vintage. She appeared more enthusiastic early on about 2007, but in this instance it’s far from merely notable – frankly, it’s utterly improbable – the richness and complexity that the Leroy team has achieved, especially considering that harvesting began here already on August 27! This collection is quite distinctive even from the very few others of its vintage that come even remotely close in quality. These 2007s display a sense of effortless effusiveness, primary juiciness, and – I don’t know how to put this less nebulously – elegance and in the best instances transparency, contrasting with the impressions of tumescent ripeness, coagulation, and new wood veneer that in some vintages accompany the profound richness of Leroy reds. As usual, the wines were all bottled in December, which at least in this vintage seems less difficult to reconcile with their exceptional quality than it does in vintages like 2005 or 2008, when so many of the other top practitioners of red Burgundy emphasize the need for longer elevage. Extremely low yields are of course also a common denominator among Bize-Leroy’s collections, although in the challenging 2007 vintage, she had somewhat more company than usual among fellow-vignerons in the roughly 20 hectoliter-per-hectare range. (And that was bounteous compared with the 13 hectoliters per hectare Bize-Leroy reports having managed in 2008, a vintage from which she did not want to show her bottled wines until June of this year, so that I shall publish notes on them in my follow-up to the present report.)

Expansive and overtly ripely fruited, yet firm, and more restrained in the finish than its aromas and initial palate impression led me to expect, here is a Vosne whose deep layers can almost certainly be mined only over a period of 10-15 years. Still, I allow for the possibility that this was in part simply having an inexpressive day or month.

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

Given the hail storm that devastated Volnay’s premier crus in 2001, it is mind-boggling that a wine of this quality could be fashioned. Its blackberry aromas lead to a broad, medium-bodied character filled with plump dark fruits. It lacks the power, concentration, as well as punch of Leroy’s finest Santenots, and reveals some stemmy characteristics in the finish, yet this wine bastes the taster’s palate with impressive layers of blackberries. It should be consumed over the next 4 years.  

Madame Lalou Bize-Leroy liked both the 2000 and 2001 vintages, stating that she was “rather pleased with the 2001s as they will bring lots of joy to those who drink them young” and that the 2000s “are candied fruit, reduction of fruit, the essence of fruit.”

Many Burgundians chose to bottle their 2001 early in order to “trap” the fruit in the bottle, but Bize-Leroy beat them all to the punch, having completed the bottling process by early September, 2002. Typically an early bottler, Mme. Bize-Leroy felt that the 2001s would lose their fruit to either oxidation or the required sulfuring if left in the barrel for a longer elevage. Overall, Domaine Leroy’s 2001s are a success, though many were found to reveal stemmy, woody tannin in their finishes. If this characteristic melts away quickly, my scores on those wines will appear overly conservative.

387,Domaine Leroy,Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru,"“My 2000 Corton-Charlemagne needs to age at least 50 years ... we will all be eating dandelions by the roots when it is ready to drink,” announced Mme. Bize-Leroy as she poured it into my glass. Intense aromas of poached pears, toasty minerals, and butter can be found in its complex aromas. A wine of exceptional concentration (its dry extract levels must be impressive!), it is hugely rich, lush, and dense. Buttered popcorn, ripe pears, and cashews are found in its medium to full-bodied, profound personality. While some readers may opt to heed Mme. Bize-Leroy’s half-century of cellaring recommendation, I would suggest drinking it over the next 15 years.

388,Domaine Leroy,Chambertin Grand Cru,"Medium to dark ruby-colored, the 2000 Chambertin exhibits tar-laced spicy black fruit aromas. This magnificent wine combines the generosity of fruit found in the finest offerings of the vintage with a power, depth, structure, and concentration that is typically lacking in the 2000s. Its intense and muscular flavor profile coats the taster’s palate with waves of super-ripe plums and blackberries whose effects linger throughout its regal, sweet finish. Certainly one of the finest reds produced in 2000, it will be at its peak of maturity between 2005 and 2014.

""There is never any bleeding in my cellars,"" said Mme. Bize-Leroy just before I gouged myself with my corkscrew, proving her wrong. Of course, she was referring to the winemaking technique of increasing concentration by ""bleeding off"" the watery juice of a light pressing prior to fermentation, not the results of my battles with her recently bottled wines.

As wine lovers have come to expect with every new vintage from this domaine, the 1996 Leroys are extraordinary, benchmark setting wines. This is the only estate I visited whose 1996s were as concentrated as the 1995s, obviously due to the fact that Mme. Bize-Leroy kept her yields exceedingly low (below 25 hectoliters/hectare). These wines will reach their respective peaks sooner than their 1995 counterparts, however, due to their softer tannins and brighter, more forward fruit.

Of course, she was referring to the winemaking technique of increasing concentration by ""bleeding off"" the watery juice of a light pressing prior to fermentation, not the results of my battles with her recently bottled wines.

As wine lovers have come to expect with every new vintage from this domaine, the 1996 Leroys are extraordinary, benchmark setting wines. This is the only estate I visited whose 1996s were as concentrated as the 1995s, obviously due to the fact that Mme. Bize-Leroy kept her yields exceedingly low (below 25 hectoliters/hectare). These wines will reach their respective peaks sooner than their 1995 counterparts, however, due to their softer tannins and brighter, more forward fruit.

540,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Aux Brulées,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  Her Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees is so sweet, seductive, opulent, unctuous, thick, and rich, yet never heavy or overbearing that it boggles the mind.  The taster truly senses the presence of something unreal.  One of the more forward of the Leroy 1993s, this wine can be drunk now or cellared for 20+ years.  When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.  Bize-Leroy's biodynamic farming methods, which do not permit any type of spraying, resulted in yields ranging from as low as 5-6 hectoliters per hectare (about 1/3 ton per acre) to a whopping 1/2 ton per acre.  Not one of her vineyards produced as much as one ton of fruit per acre (30 hectoliters per hectare).  The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

The microscopic quantities produced of some wines have not only ensured prices that only billionaires can afford, but have also made it virtually impossible to find the wines.  For example, consider the total production - for the world - of the following wines: Chambertin (75 cases), Musigny (75 cases), Latricieres (25 cases), Clos de la Roche (50 cases), Gevrey-Chambertin Les Combottes (50 cases), Richebourg (100 cases), Romanee St.-Vivant (75 cases).

543,Domaine Leroy,Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Beaux Monts,"NOTE: Prices quoted are for single bottles, not cases!
The two premier crus from Vosne-Romanee may turn out to be perfect wines, making Lalou Bize-Leroy's performance in 1993 unprecedented - at least in terms of my career as a wine tasting professional.  The Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts is less exotic and more classically structured than the Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees, with a more backward, tannic personality.  Splendidly concentrated, powerful, and pure, it is a compelling wine.
When I traveled through Burgundy, it appeared Lalou Bize-Leroy may have as many critics as I do.  Some producers accuse her of adding ""Alicante"" to her wines because she obtains such a deep color.  Others claim she is hiding hundreds of cases of grand crus in another cellar since her yields cannot ""possibly be so low.""  Of course all of this is nonsense, not to mention appallingly jealous behavior from producers who are scared to death that other growers might decide to follow in Lalou's footsteps.  For now, Bize-Leroy stands at the top of the Burgundy pyramid, alone both literally and figuratively in her pursuit of the finest Burgundy can produce.  I will keep my tasting notes brief, recognizing that in this situation it is almost criminal to try and describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.  As even the immodest Lalou Bize-Leroy says, these wines are ""an accident of nature.""  Tasting them, with their extraordinary ripeness, unctuosity, and opulence, with no hard tannin to be found, makes one think that 1993 was a completely different vintage for Domaine Leroy than it was for other Burgundians.  Yes, Mama, low yields do translate into physiologically ripe fruit, concentrated wines, and exquisite quality.  It goes without saying that everything in this cellar was aged in 100% new French oak (you cannot detect any oak in the wines because of their concentration), and bottled without fining or filtration - as usual.
No, Cindy Crawford wasn't sitting on my lap as I was tasting through Leroy's 1993s, nor was I under the influence of either the effusive and persuasive Lalou Bize-Leroy or any chemical substance.  My notes are mostly of academic interest since the quantities of wine produced at Domaine Leroy in 1993 are so preposterously low that only cases of certain wines are available.

It is a delicious, precocious wine that can be drunk now and over the next 10-15 years.

The 1992 Pommard Les Vignots would embarrass many of the sloppily made, over-cropped Pommards from supposedly top-notch domaines.  It is a big, rich, tannic, muscular wine with significant body and a backward personality.  Do not touch a bottle for 3-4 years; it is a 15-20-year wine.

The wine boasts an elegant, floral, vanillin, and cherry-scented nose, medium-bodied, concentrated flavors, a supple, velvety texture, and an easy-going, graceful, complex finish.  It should drink well for 12-15 years.  I did not have an opportunity to taste out of bottle Lalou's Musigny and Chambertin, but several cask tastings (she does not fine or filter) revealed that the 1992 Musigny looked to be the best wine in her entire portfolio.  It possessed that extra dimension of finesse as well as sensational concentration and a velvety-textured, sweet, ripe palate.  The 1992 Chambertin was also terrific, but perhaps less complex and impressive when compared to the Musigny.  If I get the chance to taste either or both of these wines from bottle on this side of the Atlantic, I will update readers with my opinions.

These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.

The most opulent, hedonistic, and decadent of this trio of premier crus is the 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Boudots.  Its huge, exotic nose of smoke, ripe cassis fruit, herbs, minerals, and roasted nuts is a turn-on.  Low in acid, this blockbuster, massively concentrated, voluptuously-textured wine is a knock-out.

These are spectacularly rich, concentrated, compelling red burgundies that are significantly less expensive than her magnificent 1990s, yet very close in quality to those wines.  And the 1990s were among the finest Pinot Noirs I have ever tasted.  Lalou, with her characteristic bravado, compares 1991 to 1959.  Her average yields were under 15 hectoliters per hectare, ranging from a low of 9 hectoliters per hectare to the highest, 18 hectoliters per hectare.  Translated into production per vine, keeping in mind that Burgundy's vineyards have from 8,000-10,000 vines per hectare compared to about 1,200 vines per hectare in California and Oregon, this is astonishingly low yields.  Because of the minuscule quantities produced and their high prices, the saddest thing about the Domaine Leroy's red burgundies is that few people have a chance to taste them.  To taste the wines of Leroy is to know what heights Pinot Noir can attain.  After tasting the 1991s from barrel last year, I thought she had fashioned the top wines of the vintage.  Now that they are in the bottle, they are even more impressive.  Prices are significantly lower (down by %25-%30), but quantities are tiny.
Produced according to the rigid disciplines of organic farming biodynamics, Lalou Bize-Leroy's 1991s are extraordinary.

572,Domaine Leroy,Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Vignerondes,"Three outstanding premier crus include the Nuits St.-Georges-Les Lavieres, Nuits St.-Georges-Les Vignerondes, and Nuits St.-Georges-Les Boudots.  Picking a favorite is akin to splitting hairs, as they are all super-rich, densely colored, broadly built, expansive, full-bodied Pinot Noirs with superb complexity and richness.  The 1991 Nuits St.-Georges-Les Vignerondes possesses a wonderful purity of character in its gorgeously ripe, expansive, perfumed nose of black-cherries and other black fruits such as plums.  Decadently rich, generous, and well-endowed, this medium to full-bodied wine reveals deep layers of flavor, soft tannins, low acidity, and a finish that lasts for more than 30 seconds.  It can be drunk now, but will easily keep for two decades.

A moderately intense bouquet of red fruits, flowers, and vanillin is followed by rich, medium-bodied, silky-textured flavors that are brilliantly well-defined and long.  One of the smoothest, most seductive 1991s, it should be drunk over the next 12-15 years, although I suspect Leroy would consider that infanticide.

Huge and massive, with great density, it is totally unevolved, with a reticent bouquet.  The power, weight, and density are something to behold, but this is an infantile, backward wine that should be purchased only by consumers with cold cellars and plenty of patience.  If you had a child born in 1991 and want a Chardonnay grand cru for his or her 21st birthday, this would be a great choice.

Lalou Bize-Leroy produced some remarkable 1991 white burgundies.  Yields averaged only 9 hectoliters per hectare in her Chardonnay vineyards and alcohol levels averaged 13.5%.  These wines will be the longest-lived whites of the 1991 vintage.

The forceful bouquet, which is just beginning to form, soars from the glass, offering up aromas of minerals, toasty oak, and gobs of black fruit.  In the mouth, there is magnificent richness, medium to full-body, and a layered, multi-dimensional, chewy texture that goes on and on.  The moderate tannins are nearly obscured by the wine's sweet concentration of fruit.  Anticipated maturity: 1996-2010+.

The 1988 vintage attests to a remarkably auspicious start for the new Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee.",1988 Domaine Leroy Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Allots,RP 88
